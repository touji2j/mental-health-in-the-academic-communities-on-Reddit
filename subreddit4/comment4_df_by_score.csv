That being said I think a withdrawal is almost always better than an F.

Academia is not the kindest place, and imposter syndrome in academia is real. You are not alone.

Please remember that you’ve come such a long way, and that you are worthy, kind, intelligent, resourceful, sensitive, and only human. 

Moving to a new country, alone, especially in your 20s is SO emotionally taxing. I’ve been moving from country to country all my life, and I’m still not over the culture shock and isolation that came with coming to university in Canada. I am doing my Master’s now, but there has been so much depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and loneliness on the way. It gets better, and if it doesn’t, there are always other options. You will make it through. 

Try and give therapy another chance.

If you struggle with depression, grad school and a career in academia might not be for you. Academia is the most emotionally unhealthy place I have ever been.

Graduate school is isolating and full of fear-mongering. You won't have time to exercise, be with loved ones, or nurture yourself emotionally. You will be run ragged every day of the week.

Finding and keeping work in academia is incredibly stressful. The jobs are scarce, so you will have to be okay with living wherever you happen to land a job, even if you don't know anyone or have any kind of support network there. If you get stuck adjuncting, you always wonder whether you'll have a job in three months. Oh, and if you adjunct, you don't get paid over the summer, so you'll have to wait tables or something.

I struggled with depression and anxiety somewhat in college, but I thought I was stable and healthy enough to take on grad school in my late 20s. Nope. After finishing my degree, I went to a therapist who diagnosed me with PTSD.

gust_wave,t2_4apnbtqh,"Hi, I have been dealing with bipolar 1 symptoms since I was 14 (mania, psychosis, and depression), and got my diagnosis when I was 18 after years of doctor's notes and reviews. I also struggle with post-traumatic stress from childhood sexual abuse. I'm also preparing to defend my MSc proposal to my committee, and I plan to continue with a PhD afterwards. I want to tell you, it's really hard sometimes. **But if you are passionate about what you're studying/researching when you aren't manic, (and that's the important bit), you can most likely figure something out.**

My advice: 

* Take your meds, if you don't have them, start convos with doctors. If you have them, and they aren't working for you, start convos with doctors. If you have them, and they are working for you, continue convos with your doctors. Adjustment is fine and good.
* Get enough sleep, and never sacrifice sleep for school. I stayed up past midnight working on school exactly 5 times during my undergrad, and I graduated with distinction. It's possible, and it wards off the depression and regulates the mania (win win) 
* Get in contact with your school's centre for student's with disabilities. Get the accommodations you need in order, so you can activate them when shit hits the fan. 
   * Set boundaries with everyone in your life. Everyone. Family, friends, supervisors at work, supervisors at school. No one is entitled to push you past your capacity to maintain your health and wellbeing. 
   * On a related note, get a good relationship with a doctor or counsellor. 
* Find out your triggers, and avoid them. Also, find out your coping mechanisms, and make use of them. If your coping mechanisms (legitimately) include substances, *watch out for troublesome and addictive behaviours*. Obviously alcohol and weed (or harder drugs), but it could also be about coffee. Have you ever seen students come out of caffeine withdrawals?  Watch out for that with *all* substances, and seek help if you need it.
* On a similar note to coping mechanisms, look at the [wellness wheel](https://www.clarion.edu/student-life/health-fitness-and-wellness/office-of-health-promotions/wellness-wheel.html). Find out what makes you happy and what makes you sad in all seven dimensions (emotional, intellectual, physical, social, environmental, financial, and spiritual), and make that the foundation of your life. Anything that threatens that foundation, deal with. 
* During your low points, you may get nothing done. That's fine. You can deal with the consequences when the darkness passes. But you gotta be alive to do that. So do what you gotta do to keep yourself alive. 
* I still struggle with this, but if you feel suicidal, reach out immediately. Suicidal ideation fucking sucks, and spending weeks catatonic will not help. Spending days talking to professionals or people who care about you will. 

I want to make it clear that, like everything, dealing with bipolar isn't a linear process. There will be set backs, there will be times when you go ""oh fuck"" and need to take a step back. That's fine. Your health is your foundation. If you don't have good health, you won't be a good student or researcher. So work with the people around you to make sure you can safeguard your health.",2020-05-23 23:14:47,frlfll9,5,academia

I'm better now that I am in a non-tenure-track position  at a smaller school, but the depression and thoughts still occur. Most of the time I can push through, but sometimes it's so overwhelming that I can barely move.

 I think graduate school is destructive for some because it isolates you. For years, whenever you interact with people outside of academia, no one understands what you do and why it's important, so unless you have an extraordinarily strong sense of self, everyone is always making you doubt your choice. You see others succeeding in careers and things that supposedly normal people do. You constantly have to rationalize your choice to forgo a lot of the typical milestones of adulthood to pursue something that--and this varies by program-- objectively has a much smaller impact on people's daily lives than many other professions.

I've decided that I'm too close to the end to drop out now but if I could go back in time, I don't think I'd choose this path again. I absolutely love teaching university classes and I'm actually pretty good at it but there are other things I want in life that require a more stable income. I say this because a quick scan of the other comments about following your dreams and passion are probably equally as valid but, as someone who's in the thick of it, they don't seem to account for the daily stress I experience about an uncertain financial future. I don't have the same familiar pressures you have; what I do have is an upbringing in a poverty and a single parent that I want to help care for (financially), especially given all the sacrifices that she made for me. So I guess this part of my comment is just to say that at least to some extent, I hear you, I feel you.   


On a more practical note, there is organization called Beyond the Professoriate that helps academics transition into non-academic careers. I've started attending their free online workshops and have book-marked them as a source for some paid career coaching when I'm closer to finished. It might be worthwhile to look into the services they offer because maybe there is a way for you to pursuit your passions and study all the fascinating things you're curious about, with a post-school plan that reworks your passions into something that provides the financial security you want.

I'd keep it more positive, more future-focused, and in no way critical of the committee. Downplay the depression aspect, or, ideally, cut it completely. You're essentially asking for a huge favor and not giving them many reasons to stick their neck out for you. Sure, you're paying tuition, but a faculty member's salary is unchanged either way, so why chance a lot of headaches on a potentially questionable student that might make life unpleasant for a whole lot of people (e.g. students, faculty, administrators) once admitted? What do you bring to the table? How will this program or department be better off as a result of admitting you? As a faculty member, what's in it for me to bring you on board?

You're not hoping to prove them wrong, you're looking to prove your own abilities. Nobody likes to be proven wrong, not even professors. 

Don't blame the previous course structure or number of exams for your past academic performance. Many grad courses will only have a midterm and a final, or even just a huge final. Don't set yourself up for someone to think ""This guy has a hard time with two-exam courses? He'll never make it in a grad program.""

TomWinter567,t2_d9yxvur,"I could have written your post at one point in my life. Many of us are attracted to academia because of the flexibility and freedom of the work environment, but the lack of structure in our work isn't psychologically good for some of us. I used to spend enormous amounts of time ""at work"" on campus, but I spent way too much of it procrastinating and socializing and I would have relatively little to show for the amount of time I put in, and then there would be marathon sessions of work before every deadline and a huge crash afterwards. It was a road to depression, unhappiness, and failure to live up to my potential. 

It took me years to figure out my problem, and I'm still working on it, but my happiness and satisfaction improved tremendously once I started imposing more structure on my work time. I get up and arrive at the office at the same time every weekday and I use an app that syncs between my computer and phone to keep track of my time at work with the goal of doing 6-9 hours of productive work each day, a minimum of 40 hours of productive work each week, and a maximum of 50 hours of work each week. (You need a minimum and a maximum because you will crash and be unproductive if you work too much. You also have to be honest and only give yourself credit for time when you mostly focused on work.) I try to do no work on Saturdays so that there is one day of proper relaxation in each week, though that isn't always possible. I started bringing a lunch from home and I limit going out for lunch or coffee with colleagues to once or twice per month. Once I started tracking my work hours carefully, I realized lunch and coffee socializing were huge time drains. I also keep a calendar in which I track my ""work days"" and ""days off"" during university breaks. It's too easy to waste your breaks sort of working every day, but not really working all that much and when the break is over you don't feel like you've accomplished very much and you don't like you really took time off.

amutualravishment,t2_31qfxol,"You sound like a fish on dry land.  Depression is just a side effect of greater troubles in your life. So you can't exactly offer your family depression as a explanation for your actions.  Whether or not they believe you have depression is irrelevant because it doesn't address the problem. What you have going on can't be diagnosed as a psychiatric disorder, though you could be diagnosed with one, two or more.. You would just be labeling behavior near arbitrarily in doing so, which is fine if it leads to peace of mind, your credibility, but most importantly medication which can help treat the overarching problem. But check this out.  To one person your behavior may be depression and to another it may be slacking off.  Guess what? The symptoms of each are the same. Objectively speaking, you are both depressed and a slacker.  Mind blowing right? But your the depression isn't coming out of nowhere; there are bigger problems in your life. So let's recap so far.

""I want to argue that my sharp drop in grades/motivation is due to depression/sleep disorder""
This doesn't tell the whole story, it doesn't really hold up. It's just a list of symptoms. What it just really says is: My depression, My sleep disorder, My loss of motivation, My drop in grades. You could also say My drug addiction. Maybe the people in your life should see one thing on that list and understand the whole picture, but they don't.

Now: ""is the result of repressed issues""
This does tell the whole story, kind of.  It's vague. What you really need (or not) is your friends and family to believe you have repressed issues. You are dealing with emotional trauma which is inescapably more consuming than academic priorities. If you face it head on you can say this is the source of your low grades AND low motivation AND depression AND sleep issues, otherwise yeah justifying low grades with ""depression"" just sounds like a cop out, especially when you're using drugs.

You're not directly asking for it, but the cure to your ailment is to make sure you eat enough(#1), exercise (cardio) like someone else mentioned), be social (limiting your drinking would go a long way), see your doctor and therapist regularly.  Go to class (sit in the first 2-3 rows, please). You do want to kill it in your final year, after all. You need to have some semblance of a schedule.. Something like you need to go to bed before 11pm and you must get ~8+ hours of sleep each night.

How to address your credibility? Stop smoking weed completely (in my opinion you have to do this otherwise you're going to continue to spend your time in your room) and kill it next academic year. Just let people see you are thriving (Behaviours speak louder than words, the other person said). If peers pressure you for an explanation, be casual and tell them you were having problems with smoking dope, or you know, you just couldn't get into the material (which is true!) and you're over that stuff now because you love the feeling of success. If you are talking to a prof, you can just say you were grappling with some personal issues and oh yeah, you're lecture was great, see you next time! (And then show up and get good grades)  So yeah, to go along with the analogy I began with: Grow legs.",2017-06-07 16:10:34,dil0t23,3,academia
blondiecommie,t2_p4bv8,"Hi there, I struggled with depression and imposter syndrome during grad school. I wanted to share some of my thoughts, hope it helps.

&amp;#x200B;

\- What you described is the textbook definition of imposter syndrome. It turns out that almost everyone experiences it in academia to some degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- It sounds like your self-esteem is very low at the moment potentially due to depression. It is feeding into your imposter syndrome and making it all the more difficult. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- In academia progress is very slow, the returns are low and positive reinforcement is far and few in between. This is hard for almost everyone, and some people cope by leaning on validation from their peers by trying to appear smarter, more confident, more apt etc. A lot of them might be struggling as well but putting on a front. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Talking to your peers openly is often the most relieving thing. If there are people you trust among your peers, you should try sharing this, you might be surprised to hear how often people respond by ""oh man, I feel you, I have been struggling so much this past month"".

&amp;#x200B;

\-You should go to therapy and to a doctor for your depression. Self-care and your well being are the most important. If you start feeling better, you might find that this whole academia thing feels a bit smoother. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Academia is not end all be all of human endeavor despite what people in academia might believe. If at any point you decide that it doesn't make you into the person you would like to live your life as then move into something else without guilt.

Academia is like everything, sometimes its toxic and sometimes it isn't. I'm only a grad student myself, but I think I helped myself tremendously by picking a good PI. He doesn't rely on grad student labor. He has a full time employee and several undergrads for that, I'm supposed to help when I have time, and if I don't have time because of something else... I don't help. He made that clear because I was trying to do both at one time. That helps, A TON. I feel like so many of my peers are being abused, working 80 hour weeks and constantly being berated. 

To me the lab is like home. We are all friends, we are all aware of each others lives. When I am other places, a conference for example. Thats when I feel the toxicity of academia more. But I feel like I can produce better work to bring to those events because my PI hasn't placed the weight of the world on my shoulders. It gives me time to produce something nice and be prepared to answer those belittling questions sometimes thrown at me.

sb138,t2_15tdfi,"It's difficult to answer your question because it truly is a sort of chicken-or-egg situation and is often different for each individual.  Also, it depends on the atmosphere of the graduate school and program, your financial situation, and how well you balance the other responsibilities surrounding your graduate career.

Here's my story: mental illness runs in my family and includes depression, anxiety, OCD, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.  Yes, all of these family members are highly-educated and tend to lean toward the arts.  Personally, I have a history of anxiety and OCD, but I had it somewhat under control until 3 years into graduate study.  I have always been a perfectionist, highly critical of myself and overly-analytical about everything, but I found solace in literary study, art and music.  So yes, there's that introverted, perfectionist background of the academic that lends itself to both mental illness and the probability of continuing one's education.  In addition, the literary works I gravitate toward to tend to be more psychological and depressing, so there's that as well.  But shortly before I went to graduate school, much of that isolation and perfectionism had gone to the wayside.  I'd go so far as to say I was a bit full of myself at the beginning because I had graduated from a more prestigious university for undergrad and had taken a couple of years off to study for the LSAT and explore my options.  During that break I spontaneously moved 10 hours away from my hometown to live with my best friend in a shitty little apartment outside of NYC and made money by teaching pre-k, and I was damned good at it, winning ""teacher of the year"" my first year teaching.  I also got engaged a year before graduate school, and everything seemed to be working out nicely.  For the first time in my life, I felt good about myself, my abilities and my future; I was nothing but confident and ready for the next step.

By the time I had decided on graduate school, I had switched gears and, instead of going to law school as I had originally planned, I realized I was more passionate about literary analysis and teaching and entered an English graduate program that was meant as a sort of doctoral program with master's along the way.  The first couple of years were fantastic, and I felt like the 'golden child' of the program.  It was as though I had found my people, and I was thrilled to be amongst people who were nerds for theory as much as I was.  Almost immediately I had my master's thesis published by a literary journal, and I considered most of my professors supportive mentors within the span of only a couple of years.  I was set, had my permanent committee organized and on board way before my peers, felt great about everything and had no doubt in my mind that I'd get that longed-for tenure-track job once I graduated from the doctoral program because I had excellent references, strong support and a few publications under my belt.

Well, as life often goes, things didn't go as planned, and, by the end of the first year of the doctoral program, I was on 3 different medications to control my anxiety and ever-growing sense of dread in the morning when I had to go to campus to teach an introductory composition course to a group of less-than-enthusiastic freshmen.  My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer a year later, I had to push back my exams because I was driving home every other weekend to help her through chemotherapy, and my exams did not go well because I had one particular committee member who was giving me a hard time.  Because I was often gone due to my mother's cancer treatments, I wasn't seen around campus as often, causing my committee to basically forget about my exams.  I showed up to take my exams on the scheduled date, but my chair had forgotten to prepare my materials!  I went home in tears, wallowing in self-pity and old episodes of Futurama over pad thai and ice cream.  Eh, we were all partly to blame for that situation, but I took it HARD.  I've never tested well and suffer from debilitating testing anxiety anyway, so while I was never worried about writing and publishing, the idea of being judged on a stressful timed exam sent me over the edge.  Having actually been *forgotten* was the absolute worst.  I started having schizophrenic episodes (heard voices, imagination going wild - that sort of thing).  I had to go to therapy and was closely monitored because I admitted I had thought of suicide as an option if I didn't pass my exams.  It was a bad, scary time in my life, but I passed my exams with a couple of caveats (made to appease the one committee member with a chip on his shoulder who said I lacked the confidence necessary to be a scholar).  The anxiety subsided after I passed my exams, but I never fully regained the confidence I had before beginning the doctoral program.  I started questioning my self-worth and place in academia (yes, imposture syndrome is a very real thing, and most everyone I know suffers from it), and then the humanities positions started drying up fast anyway (I'm still an on-again, off-again adjunct professor making next to nothing with a total of 4 degrees to my name and a ridiculous amount of student loan debt).  With all that said, I breezed through my dissertation, enjoyed the research and writing, and ultimately found that graduate school shaped me for the better.  I only wish I hadn't taken it all quite so seriously and had maintained some form of life outside of my academic work.  I honestly can't say whether it was graduate school itself that took a massive toll on my mental health or if it was the unrealistic expectations I had for myself, expectations I probably would have had regardless of what path I had decided to take.

I'm sorry if my story didn't directly answer your question, but even after thinking back and analyzing my own experience, I still can't decide if people like me are simply more inclined to go to graduate school or if I am a product of the burning hoops I was made to jump through.  Others I know had much happier and positive experiences, and all I can say is those who had an easier time in graduate school had strong communities of friends, met with their mentors often for coffee and discussion, and spent a LOT of time at the bars on the weekends enjoying life outside of graduate school with grad buddies.  It's something to think about before making your decision, and I wish you all the best!",2017-04-12 03:29:02,dg5epz8,2,academia

SnowblindAlbino,t2_7ild5,"People don't seem to be grasping the reality of the situation. The odds are high that a large number of US colleges/university will *close forever* as a result of COVID-19 if fall enrollments are impacted. The revenue hit from spring alone (lost income and refunded housing/board fees) has created large deficits at many schools. Two weeks ago Inside Higher Ed reported that there are hundreds of schools with insufficient liquid reserves to cover more than 2-3 months of operating expenses. That's one semester. 

Public schools like AZ will fare differently, but remember what happened in 2008-2010. Conservative legislators slashed higher ed budgets and never replaced them. That shifted cost burdens onto students and required cuts that were never restored, including shifting many faculty lines from TT to contingent labor. Taking on new graduate students or pledging to fund them for multiple years would be irresponsible in this environment for all but the handful of elite schools that are essentially self-funding via endowment and grant incomes.

These graduate departments at Arizona may not even *be* there in five years, and the faculty teaching in them could well be laid off this fall. By telling students this up front they are doing the right thing. It's an unprecedented crisis-- nothing like this has happened in the US since the Great Depression --and this black swan moment will never be reversed by a WWII-scale spending spree, a GI Bill, a Baby Boom, or even a general agreement that investing in higher education is good for the country. Instead there will be massive cuts, contractions, and closures at all but the most elite schools. Higher ed will look very different in five years. The only thing worse than *starting* a Ph.D. right now is probably having the terrible luck to be *finishing* one in what may well become the worse academic market in a century.",2020-04-10 16:46:43,fn088dd,2,academia

mrgumble,t2_dwtep,"If you want a third, objective statement of you having a depression, go see a doctor and get treatment. Without a proper diagnosis, you will only appear to others as 'feeling depressed', to which the usual (unhelpful) advice is to 'pull yourself together' (PYT). If you do have a depression, PYT'ing will consistently feel out of reach, so the advice simply worsens your self-esteem.

Getting a proper diagnosis is in line with other answers here: *Get proper help*. If you *do* have a depression, you cannot resolve it yourself. It will just worsen.

There are caveats to this: Even with a proper diagnosis, your family might still not understand your situation and will still advice you to just PYT. Getting a diagnosis may be difficult if you are displaying symptoms that are just below the diagnosis threshold. Do not satisfy yourself with a dismissal by a doctor that did not listen to you.

Diagnosing a depression is however entirely *subjective* to the examiner and how you are presenting yourself. You cannot have an objective diagnosis of mental disorder. As mentioned above, even with a clear-cut diagnosis, family members may still not be receptive of it.

There are various treatments to depressions. There are loads of psykofarmaka and getting the one that works *for you* might be tricky, especially if you want to avoid side-effects. You might also be advised to follow cognitive therapy, which can help you uncover what 'gets you down' and help find solutions to avoiding these situations, or provide better coping techniques.

You are also responsible for getting your depression and anxiety under control so that you can perform adequately. If you need therapy, medication, etc, you need to get that before grad school.

One thing I would advise, is to also consider your own mental health.

Academia has the tendency to lead to some depression and anxiety issues, and those could even persist once you leave research. Or, alternatively, your current situation would have been okay if you were able to handle mental health issues a little better. Sometimes we get this idea of ""it will be better once I go here.""

iwantabrother,,"Oh boy, a professor here, and I think you're missing at least half the point. 

To me, the hardest part of being an academic is not the academics itself - I've always been confident of my academic abilities and the ability to keep producing papers (and unless you're at this level of confidence, academia will destroy your mental health...) But the thing that stressed me out was the fact that my life was put on hold for so long.

Between grad school, postdoc, and tenure-track, I made several long-term research visits to various places in the world as well, and I never stayed in the same place for more than a couple of years max (sometimes moving every semester). I'm not talking moving houses, I'm talking about moving countries.

This made it very hard to forge long-lasting interpersonal relationships, and the few friends/SOs that I managed to make all disappeared from my life with my next move. Towards the end of my postdoc, I decided that it wasn't worth making friends anymore and chose to be the loner aside from the departmental colleagues, because I was so sick of putting all the work into making friends only to have it disappear a year later.

The competitive job market was also really difficult for me. As I said, I was very confident (99% of the others weren't, and it threw them into depression or anxiety, so this is something to think about) that I could get a job. The problem was, *where* would I get a job? Plenty of great universities are situated in the middle-of-nowhere towns that would die off so quickly if that university weren't there. I would literally have no chance to meet people outside of the university if I ended up in one of these towns (you think you wouldn't be a part of it; I thought I'd definitely be a professor at Harvard when I started out in grad school. Your life goals go through a severe modification process while in academia! Majority of people in academia are thankful to get *any* positions, including the ones in crappy towns. I wasn't.)

Then the politics was really difficult for me. It just killed me that some people could get jobs because their advisors are well-connected, or because their best friend's institutions were hiring, they could get interviews easily. I was raised in an academic environment where people look down on politics (my advisor is a very special and competent researcher) so I had no idea how to play the politics game. 

In the end, I really lucked out by getting an R1 job in a large city without having played any political game. But I am a very very rare case, I actually can't think of many others like me. It also means that I'm surrounded by people who are super into political games. It feels slightly toxic but I guess I like research enough that I'm going to stick with it for now.

Being in academia took a huge emotional toll on me; if I could choose my life over again, I'd probably just become a doctor or a lawyer or something. I only survived because I was absolutely certain that I wanted to be a professor, and because I always believed in my abilities. If you don't have that kind of conviction, believe me, academia will do much more damage.

Just remember that it's your *life* that you're trying to make a decision on. Don't just consider your academic abilities and aptitude; also think very hard about whether this lifestyle is for you. It's a very unique one. I still travel up to 3 months in a year, and it turns out that I'm not a fan of traveling. Uh-oh.",2017-09-02 18:54:54,dmh7hat,1,academia
natyio,t2_20cktj9g,"I see that the post is already 26 days old. So I am late to the party. But I hope I can still chip in with a bit of useful advice:

1. Your thesis does not have to be perfect. It only has to be good. So aim for that.
2. Having a clear structure for the thesis is important. Know what topics/materials/results to include and what you want to highlight. This is something you can talk about with your supervisor
3. Take breaks. This is often underestimated. There are times in the day when your mind is tired or occupied with other things. Go out, take long walks and let your brain run free so that when you come back to the office your mind is refreshed and focussed when you get back to writing. And stay off the internet! During your breaks you do not want any more mental input!
4. Enjoy writing! I understand that you are going through some difficult times at the moment, but please try to remember why you signed up for your field of study back in the day. There is something you love about the field and you are now able to express your love by writing your thesis. Write about the things that fascinate you and write about how your research fits into the bigger picture! Use the discussion part of your thesis to delve deeper into those results that are the most interesting.
5. Be consistent. Write every day. Including weekends. For at least one hour every day. On bad days, it will be exactly one hour. On very good days you might make 5 hours. Write down starting and end times so that you know for sure how much time you've spent.
6. Writing is actually several processes: Note-taking/Brainstorming, writing and editing. Your brain is in different moods at different times and accordingly some of these processes work well at different times. So try to take advantage of that.
   1. Note-taking/Brainstorming happens when you just write down bullet points. Often times these bullet points are TODOs about things you still want to to for your thesis or things that would be nice to have.
   2. writing is writing out your thoughts in long form. This often results in drafts of text. Do not aim for quality. Just make sure that the things you want to say are being said in the text.
   3. Editing. You improve the writing from step 6.2. so that you get a text of good quality.
7. Look after yourself! Make sure your body and mind get what they really need. I know that this is easier said than done, but it is very tempting to just grind your way through. Try to give yourself better conditions and it will probably make the whole thing easier.

As for the depression/anxiety: Make sure you have someone who can support you emotionally in the meantime. At least someone you can reach out to and talk to every day. It should not be your supervisor. It can be on the phone or via chat. Just have someone else so that you are not going through this alone.

For context. I started my PhD in fine mental health. I was suicidal by my 2nd year. It wasn't because of a toxic program or lab (my advisor is amazing and supportive) but it was so mentally taxing that when some personal issues came up they spiraled out of control.

Same supportive lab, one of my labmates went missing for weeks. When I found him he was in bad shape. His depression became unmanageable.

Another person who started the same year as me (coming in with tenuous mental health - not well controlled depression) quit before reaching candidacy.

These are just three anecdotes but they are representative of the actual peer reviewed statistics on this issue.

However, are you suggesting that you would switch advisors, but still remain funded on the old advisor's project?  I would not do that.  Definitely not.  This would be unusual in my field and I think it's inadvisable anywhere.

Whether this is good or bad for a new professor's career is not your primary concern (honestly, it's probably a little bit of both).  And whether he's angry or not is also not your concern.

What does worry me a little bit though is the substantial amount of anxiety that shines through your post, and I'd point out that this is not healthy going forward.  Keep in mind that nobody is ""out to get you"", and that your success is their success, normally, in an academic environment.  People don't get to ascend to a tenure-track position if they are as overcome by anger or jealousy as you seem to project onto them.  You might benefit from seeking some counseling in that matter -- academia can be a pressure-cooker and I've seen it breed anxiety, depression and other unproductive thought patterns.

Cogitore,t2_dvzf16,"I've never been diagnosed as bi-polar, but I have ""phases"" of mania and depression that can extend for anywhere from months to years at a time.  It has been that way since I was a teenager.

During the manic phases, I can write 5+research papers in a year (most get published in top peer-reviewed journals).  During the depressive phase, I struggle to write one paper in a year.  

I've been doing that for 40 years, have an Ivy League education, am a full professor at a (lower) R1 university, and have a very sizable publication record.  

Suggestions: #1 exercise (enough to break a sweat and get some natural endorphins); #2 get ample sunlight (or buy a SAD lamp);  #3 proper diet, vitamins (I also take P-5-P (a type of B6), D, and Co-Q10), etc.. #4 don't expect ideas to come out of a vacuum!!! In my own case, 90% of my research ideas come to mind while I'm reading a book/article or teaching a grad seminar.  So, put together a list of relevant books/articles and write out a daily schedule for those readings.  I used to use 3x5 yellow pads.  Each page had the day as a header, then a list of to-do items and expected amount of time for each.  Below that, an hourly schedule for the day.  I would then cross out each task at the top once completed.  Keep that list in your pocket, on your desk, (or do the digital equivalent -- maybe a widget for your screen).

It worked great all through school. I never went without it from my 2nd year as an undergrad, through my MA and my Ph.D..  I still return to it now and then.

Currently, I'm in a depressive phase, but have been letting myself take a breather for a few months to recover from 2017: I completed 13 different research projects last year (a couple journal articles but mostly invited chapters for various anthologies as well as 2 co-edited collections).

kojak211,,"Can Totally relate-At my Junior college I had a 3.9 and got into UCLA where my depression came back. It was very bad soph-senior year of high school and it became manageable during junior college. I barely got out with a 2.5. Most of it was because of me just being too down to even be able to withdrawal from a class. 


 A 2.5 will get me absolutely nowhere and that got me in a rut until I went to Asia and applied to a M.A in TEFL instruction. Looking back, I'm glad things turned out the way it did. I had a chance to experience living outside the U.S and broadened my interests. Best of all, I'm NOT in debt. I can pay for it all in cash by having a part time job teaching English. 

If that is your passion, you WILL find a way no matter how impossible it seems. People say my M.A from Asia is trash and not worth anything. I don't give a shit. My goal is to get the PHD and to teach Psychology and there is absolutely nothing that can stop me from getting there.

nomely,t2_hse9b,"My university only runs a counseling program, which I would note you haven't mentioned. Clinical programs often focus research on more extreme psychology, while counseling is a more day-to-day type of practice. If your interest is in working with the normal person, who experiences relationship distress, or depression, or anxiety, or grief, or trauma, all of those are counseling topics. So is assessment. Counseling programs also offer a range of types.

Iowa State is one of the best in the nation, and although I'm in a different psych area, a close friend is counseling. It's a full day (8-5) of classes, practicum, and supervision. Normally 4 classes per semester, taken in a strict order. On top of that you're supposed to do research, although the expectations for output are lower (maybe a pub a year). Our department is heavily focused in clinical practice training.

A lot of what people would think of as therapy is done by social work master's, which is not always well-publicized. The PhD is usually a significant pay bump but is 3 more years and a lot more work, so it's a trade-off.

An ex went to George Washington in DC for counseling, and found the program was heavily program administration and research.

I don't know if this is obvious and I should shut up, but you might consider what kind of specialty you'd be interested and look up therapists in your area. See where they graduated from, and what degree.

Finally, any well-accredited program (which should be the only kind you apply to) is required to publish statistics on how many graduate, and how many get clinical internships.

Basically they plan on reviewing my application by factoring my grades from this semester (they only had 1 semester of grades and I pulled a C average on them) I was thinking a letter showcasing the upward trend in my performance, which tracks with my depression quite nicely. I figure this would work in conjunction with the rest of the materials they already have.

Something like this:

To the admissions committee members, (dont know who heads it)
Paragraph 1: I understand that the first decision the committee came to was X, given my grades at the time, I probably would have done the same thing; however, as my personal statement briefly mentioned I have been dealing with depression because of Y which caused my grades to plummet in my first semester.

paragraph 2:
To its credit the committee has reopened my case with my spring semester grades in mind. I had a rough start to the spring semester, but ended up getting X grades, and even got a 99 on my last final in class Z. One of my classes I did not do as well in because there were only 2 exams, which made it harder to overcome a rough start. Otherwise, I feel my grades are starting to show my true academic abilities.

3: I expect this progress to maintain itself, and possibly even improve because after 1 year of dealing with this (and seeking treatment) things are starting to get better, and I have no intentions of stopping treatment anytime soon. Finally if any committee members are still not confident I can succeed at the graduate level, I urge you to give me a chance to prove you wrong, after all the easiest way to prove I am capable of succeeding at the graduate level is to let me take classes and earn good grades.

In most fields (certainly my humanities field, but also many, many science fields) competition is fierce.  What does this actually mean?  This means that for my TT job (the one I ended up with) there were (I found out later) 295 applicants.  Let that sink in.  I was up against 5 PhDs from Harvard, 5 from Yale, 3 from Columbia, etc. etc.   It is a fucking miracle I ended up with my job.  

I'm on a search committee right now, and for a fairly narrow field, we got 125 applicants.   Now, 60 of those right away were significantly weaker--immediate toss-outs.  But we ended up with 30 to 40 really, really top candidates.  Like, 40 candidates who on paper (by recommendations, publications, grants, etc.) were all fucking amazing.  

What do you do?  You start looking for weakness.   Seriously, that's the ONLY thing you can do.   You start reading 30 great dissertations--ingenious topics, strong research--but you can only talk to 14 of them for the first round interviews.  What do you *do*??!!!  Your eye starts looking for imperfections.  It's only human. 

So, you have 10 candidates who have 3 rec letters (each) who all write, ""this is the best student I've ever had.""  Then, you get to the candidate of whom they write, ""this candidate is exceptional--particularly in the way how she overcame her severe depression to accomplish so much.""  Now, we can all SAY to each other (and to ourselves) that we support people facing challenges...  but the reality is, when reading 20 ""perfect"" applications, and one that says ""very good--overcame X handicap""...  that one that says ""overcame X handicap"" i just not going to get the job. 

So, when one of your colleagues says, ""There's no place for weakness"" in their department, they are both being a total clueless asshole *and* perhaps trying to get across something important:

If you're applying for jobs, and your letters all say, ""Candidate x is great, he/she overcame the severe handicap of epilepsy to finish a fantastic PhD"", while all your competitors letters say, ""Candidate y is simply the best in field, full stop.""... well, you're NOT going to beat out candidate y for a job.  That is the cold, hard facts. 

Does this mean that people with epilepsy can't pursue PhDs??  NO.  Absolutely not.  But it DOES mean:   you *cannot* let this become a characteristic that makes it into your rec letter.  If you want to be competitive in a brutal job market, you HAVE to have your recommenders say, ""this person is amazing"", NOT ""this person is amazing because they accomplished so much despite having severe epilepsy.""  

So, others will downvote this... but I'm taking the time to write it out to be helpful, and not bullshit you with p.c. platitudes.   (and if we were having this conversation face-to-face, I would not be saying this...!)  

Yes,  You can indeed do very well, and thrive in a PhD program.!  

But:   if you're in-and-out-of-hospital constantly, that *does* affect your work.  If all of our colleagues and supervisors know you have epilepsy enough to comment on it--well, that means it's probably going to wind up in your letters.   And if it affects your work, and/or winds up in your letters, it's going to hurt on the job market.    That is the reality. 

(That's why I'm so frustrated by my undergrads who ask for/sign up for ""accommodations"" for a whole range of disabilities--getting extra time on exams, etc. etc-- and then ask me for letters recommending them to top grad programs at Harvard or Yale.  It's the same problem.  If you want to be ""competitive"" at the very highest level, you absolutely cannot ""show weakness"" and remain competitive...  That is brutally unfair fact of life.   The person who told you that may have been a total dick, but still might have been doing you a favor.)",2019-12-26 03:37:39,fc1w0w8,1,academia

Empirical framework is basically previous studies done on ur research topic and the point is to make a case for ur topic by showing the gaps in those studies that ur research covers... Small example... Say ur topic is about workplace mental illness with independent  variables such as anxiety, depression,  ptsd etc and perhaps employee performance as the dependent.... In the empirical framework part, u would reference studies such as the 2016 UN report about depression being a leading cause of disability by the year 2020.. That study has a gap because it only deals with depression (I don't remember the study well so this is just an example) and ur study will go into depression, anxiety, PTSD and whatever other variable etc... U could also reference a study about the amount of work days lost in a month and the $925 billion anually lost globally due to depreasion in the workplace (again I don't quite remember the study well) the gap in this study is again it only focuses on depression and it uses a financial indicator while urs will use employee performance...

MBarbs2197,t2_6qhe7akd,"Hi, I'm not psychiatrist nor psychologist, and my advice certainly won't be the best, but I will try to share my experience in the best possible way that I can. 

To put you in context, I was also undergoing some serious trouble with anxiety and depression, since I have memory, but got really intensified during my first year of undergrad. I won't go through the details but things got really fucked up, I was throwing away my whole life through self-destructive behaviors and getting involved in toxic relationships. However, I feel identified with you in the fact that, although I couldn't feel any excitement or meaningfulness in anything that I did, I could still figure out some ""potential"" passion regarding my studies. 

First off, I wouldn't rely solely on antidepressants. Any kind of external help is limited (and maybe even useless) if you don't put the effort amd attention on working on yourself. I visited psychiatrists, psychologist and seeked for any possible kind of help. I had a period of 5 months sort of getting better , but when I was back in the wrong way, I wasn't gradually getting worse again, I picked it up exactly where I left off, and that was by far the worst time in my life, and you certainly don't want to be in that place (if you aren't yet). This happended to me for not putting absolutely any effort on repairing myself. However, professional advice can be very valueble, just try and see what works for you. So here's my little piece of advice (what worked for me):

1. Embrace the fact that this can be a life lasting chronic illness, and you will need to work on it daily for the rest of your life. The moment you relax can easily put you back we're you started. 

2. Take care of your physical health. I don't know exactly why, or if there is any kind of academic evidence, but you will certainly feel better much more easily if your health isn't a holly mess. Try developing well settled sleeping, dieting and sport habits, being as intentional as you possibly can with them. Also be sure to  get enough sunlight.

3. SMILE UNTIL IT HURTS. This was definitely the first big step to getting better and should've been the first one. . This built up possitive momentum (and who knows, maybe even altering my brains neurochemistry) and was certainly essential giving me the force I needed to get out of the shitty place I found myself in.

4. Work consistently on developing a spirituality. Like I mean meditation and that kind of mindfulness practices, but also getting to build a relationship with the idea of a ""greater power"" or ""God"" or however you want to call it. Get rid of any intellectual impediments, it's not a matter of believing because it's true, but rather because it's useful. Developing a deep relationship with this idea was critical to feel safe in the world I live in. Know I'm always sure that whatever happens, it is always for the better, and most importantly, that I'm never alone. 

5. This also means working on certain values such as ACCEPTANCE, GOOD WILL, RECEPTIVITY, HONESTY and HUMILITY. I found those extremely important on building up my spirituality. The most critical part of it is to act them out. 

6. Be intentional with your relationships. Work patiently on building up deep and meaningful relationships with family, friends, and maybe a romantic partner if you're prepared for it. Be very careful with toxic relationships, as they can screw up all progress (not like blaming on other people, but sometimes it is inevitable or, rather difficult to avoid, the fact that certain personalities or people bring us back to our old patterns of thinking, just be careful, intentional and patient about whom you want before you on life). 

7. Be careful and intentional with the way you speak. If I was to say and repeat, ""what a terrible day"", I would be terribly miserable even if I won the lottery. On the other hand, just the fact that I was saying the contrary, using positive and constructive ways of speaking and not ranting everytime about how much I hated everything, would make it much easier for my to deal with any problem that could've come out during the day.

8. READ a lot. As a child, I remember I had always hated reading. However, it was the only thing that could maintain me sufficiently entertained and concentrated to distract me from my destructive thoughts. Plus, there is great value on reading, whereas it's learning new stuff with non-fiction books, or just fulfilling yourself with stories that you love. From what I've read since the day I started putting myself together, I can strongly recommend 'Factfulness' from Hans Rosslind (uplifting narrative and facts), '12 rules for life' from Jordan B. Peterson (and strongly recommend every piece of content he publishes on this regard, regardless of your opinion on his controversial political opinions, he has invaluable advice for people like us and seems to me that he's on the same boat), 'Les miserables', Victor Hugo (Again, uplifting, and extremely beautiful story of invaluable worth, this was by far my favourite and best book I EVER ever read, strongly recommend); 'Man's search for meaning', Viktor Frankl ( this guy survived 5 concentration camps and still managed to pass away with head over his shoulders, must know better than anyone, again very useful advice). 

9. Develop a passion. I found out that passion isn't held within, it is rather developed, same as interests. This sums up when coming to meaningfulness and fulfillment. Personally, as you can figure out, the passions I developed to the date are basically reading and my studies. 

10. Be kind and loving to yourself. I mean, if you know you're trying your damn best to improve your attitude and behaviour, let yourself to take a deep breath and keep pushing forward. Anybody is perfect and less when things are starting to roll, so don't be extremely harsh or self-destructing (I know, it sounds easy to say, but really try, it's possible and very helpful even if it's for a moment). 

10. However, try to know yourself as you really are, not how you think you are. This helps to notice things you can change when things stop improving. Be realistic about your actions and focus enough on what's keeping you back until it improves again. Trying to figure out how you managed to end up in such a compliicated circumstance might give some insights on where to start.

Anything regarding the work issues, I think you were given very good advice. Brake down everything into bite sized chunks (including all the above stated) and just write, there will be time for edition and perfectionism later on. 

After 1 year and 7 months, my life's in decent order again. I have a meaningful romantic relationship, I'm doing fairly decently academically and I'm working on building and repairing some fucked up friendships and family relationships. It's far from perfect but it gets better every day. Plus, I don't take any kind of medication regarding my mental health anymore, and I feel that works awesomely for me (however as I tried to explain before, that is up to professional advice, all this rant was only trying to say ""hey, you can also try this, maybe before, or maybe while you take ADs, but don't let yourself not to take care on you, as I certainly didn't do while expecting that some magical pill would safe my life) I know that every person is different and we each undergo such complicated illnesses our own ways, but I think this is the best advice I can give you. Basically, don't wait for the help to arrive, for anyone to rescue. Secure yourself by working hardly on it and who knows, it might work, but people die from this shit, and it's definitely worth trying. I hope you the best and feel free to contact (if possible) whenever. For anyone else, if you found this useful, please share, if you found it bullshit, please say. It's just the best piece of advice I can give you based on my own personal experience, and it might not work for you, but I really hope it does. And excuse my terrible english, I hope I could make myself clear enough. Good luck!

SapiosexualStargazer,t2_1vka1piy,"I am a PhD student who also struggles with anxiety and depression. While I am not in the thesis-writing stage of graduate school yet, I do have experience struggling (but succeeding!) to manage seemingly insurmountable tasks in a professional (academic) environment. Here's what helps me:

When I sit down to work and feel crippled by anxiety, I take a few deep breaths and then whip out a notepad. (I even put some consideration into what forms of note-taking make me the most comfortable, and I try to keep those handy.)

I channel my anxiety into writing down every task that I think I need to complete. I try to break them down into as small of units as possible. Once I have exhausted all of the little things that come to my mind, I reflect on the whole list. I take another deep breath.

At this point, I usually feel like the list is huge, but clearly *finite*, where my anxiety-induced conception of things previously had me feeling like the task list went on *forever*. This is a small win. I take a deep breath.

I spend a little bit of time reading through my list. I try to rank all of the tasks by urgency (or general importance, if urgency isn't the most relevant limiting factor) via colored highlighters (with a legend!) or numbers or whatever makes the most sense at the time. I take a deep breath.

I look over the list of highest ranked tasks. I decide which one I want to tackle *today*. I take a deep breath, and I take a stab at the task.

After a while, I inevitably get distracted (or discouraged) from that task. I take a deep breath, and I look back at my list. I ask myself which of the lower-ranked tasks sounds the most interesting *right now*. I pick one. I take a deep breath and I try to work on that task.

Wash, rinse, and repeat. I just try to make sure that I always circle back to higher priority tasks between every one or two lower priority tasks.

I hope this helps. Good luck in your studies!",2020-08-09 04:32:08,g0v1f5m,1,academia
Prudent_Astronomer_4,t2_6dre7okj,"I'm a PhD student and I also have suffered from anxiety and depression. I've found that exercise really helps. I walk my dog everyday and I make sure to have a podcast to listen to while I walk. Is there somewhere you can go to walk, while you have an audio book or something to take your mind off things? Make it a daily goal if you can. 

I also take an SSRI and I hope to start therapy soon (not so easy as I live in a country where I don't speak the language). This doesn't work for everyone, but this medication has really cleared my mind and I don't catastrophise or ruminate as much as before. Talk to your psychiatrist about it. Escitalopram (Lexapro) has the fewest side effects, generally speaking. 

Regarding writing a thesis, don't think of it as a huge 15,000 word challenge. Break it down into individual goals or chapters and tackle one at a time.

EatMyLederhosen,t2_3e743rgw,"&gt;When someone presents studies of  horrible mental health of Ph.D. students and postdocs (like people  suffering from depression, anxiety etc). Academic community: \*silence\*

The truth is, a lot of successful academics don't care because they consider these people to be weak and unable to hack it.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When someone talks about PhD glut and  lack of career options in academia (with references to ""the Economist""  and Nature).  Academic community: \*silence\*

I have never heard a full professor acknowledge the fact that every single person in 'their group', other than them, has almost zero chances of a long-term academic career. I have a few times been in meeting or at dinner where a couple of bitter long-term postdocs will bring up the lack of career chances and all the professors go completely silent. In fact, mentioning this topic is maybe the only way to shut some of these people up.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When someone speaks about the ""crisis  of reproducibility"", unreliable or forged results that stem from  ""publish-or-perish"" paradigm. Academic community: \*silence\*

The problem with this is if you start talking about it, you might end up having to hold yourself to higher standards. For young researchers it is understandable since trying to do really high quality careful research means almost certain career death.

DocMondegreen,t2_wnbu1,"This does not sound like an atmosphere conducive to sharing info about depression. I'd normally suggest sharing to help lessen the stigma, yadda yadda, but that is just not valid for everyone. 

What I would do instead: work on prioritizing your work. Talk to your PI about how you can accomplish x and y, but not z, unless he wants you to do z, in which case you'll push back y. Set your own reasonable deadlines, and if you take the lead, you might be able to convince everyone that these were their idea. Proactively request formal check-ins from coworkers on certain dates/intervals so they're not always ambushing you about work. Talk about how the pandemic and the practical limitations on the lab/research are affecting you and your research (since it seems your PI is not open to discussing emotional distress). Is it harder to get interlibrary loan? Does your home computer just take longer to run regressions? idk- whatever sounds reasonable but *tangible*. Plus, you can't just work 20 hours a day because you need to start work on the next round of applications, too, and could the PI find a moment to review your research statement? They should also be supportive of your continued job search (and gently remind them of this if they push back). 

Also, if there are pay problems, go above their heads and get that fixed! Talk to HR, payroll, bursar, ombuds, whoever. It should not roll back on you unless someone in your lab is messing up the paperwork. Of course, if you absolutely cannot get it fixed, you might have to contact the labor board, which may or may not have repercussions for you. I somehow suspect that financials may have affected your mental state.

wirrbeltier,t2_6cvqbsaw,"Biology PhD from the Netherlands here. In our group/department, we have a mentoring program, ombudspeople for conflict resolution, and several offices for grad student progress monitoring. Offers for mental health / resiliency training are ubiquitous, e.g. participating in personal coaching sessions. I did one in a previous project and it did help (also I dropped that project afterwards, but that's a different story). Of course pressure is high in general, but there usually are at least people you can talk to. 

Thus, there are offers, but the onus is on the PhD to make contact. I personally am okay with this setup, but if someone is seriously depressed it could be hard for them to make this move. Treatment for depression is something that is taken care of in the general health system, as far as I know there are no special mental-health professionals available for PhD students. 

As for the lockdown, at least in my direct environment it's been handled quite well. The department/institute has been relatively responsive and communicative, with weekly update letters and online discussion sessions between PhD student representatives and the admin top brass every month or so. It does help that most PhD positions are funded fully for a fixed 4 years in advance, and that we are treated as proper employees with benefits instead of students. We have had soft announcements from admin that extensions would be discussed on a case-by-case basis. The grant funding agencies are currently discussing whether they will grant extensions, but I doubt it will happen. The Universities as a whole are not as dependent on tuition as in the US/UK, so as far as I can see there is no looming higher-ed enrolment apocalypse coming. 

My department and PI have actually been supportive throughout the lockdown, mostly through relaxed performance requirements and upbeat messages. We have all been asked to make the best of our time, and so far almost everyone has been able to find something to do. The lockdown is being relaxed gradually, and I guess until a second wave hits people will gradually restart labwork and try to get things done as quickly as possible.

I never connected it specifically to my work in lab (not that my thoughts were any better).

I was so burnt out by the time I graduated. I forced my graduation after 7 years and by that time, I had 2 weeks to write my dissertation. The stress was crushing me to a point where I would have constant panic attacks, and I didn't even know what panic attacks were. I had convinced myself I was finished with working in a lab, but there was no time to find a new job. The easiest thing was to just get a postdoc... So I did.

It's one of the best things I've done. I switched fields. I got a project I loved. I got to develop a project I love. But when it all falls down to it again... When I'm not making progress and not working up to my standard, the darkness just creeps back in ever so slowly. 

Mental health is so important. If you're not happy, what's the use of everything? If it's the work itself that makes your skin crawl, find something else. Working at the bench is definitely not your only skill. You are trained in critical thinking, problem solving, you probably work well with others, can adapt to changing situations, can follow and optimize a process... So many things. Don't sell yourself short.

If it's the project that makes you unhappy, maybe give a year's postdoc a try. When I was hesitant to make the jump into my postdoc, my advisor's advice to me was that ""it's just a job"". You can always quit if you don't like it. Who cares? If you don't stay in academia after that, you're not burning any bridges. Just be honest about why you've made your decision.

I'd have a talk with your advisor. If you feel comfortable, share your struggles with him/her. It's important that you get on a similar page (if not the same) so that he/she can understand why you may not be delivering at the quality or rate you used to in the past.

SnowblindAlbino,t2_7ild5,"My setting is pretty much like OP's; I'm at a moderately SLAC where the price tag is about 1.5x the median household income for the US. I'm also a department chair, so have some insight into what my colleagues are doing.

Our response to the sudden shift online has been, generally, to try to maintain the *content* we would have otherwise delivered, but to significantly reduce expectations.    We lost two full weeks of instruction in the turmoil, so that had an unavoidable impact. It's also true, of course, that exactly zero of our faculty had any experience with online education so we're frankly not very good at it even though teaching is by far our #1 criterion for hiring and promotion.

So personally, I have dropped a few assignments that simply wouldn't have worked online. I've also dropped a bit of content due to the lost weeks of instruction. I've made some of the readings ""optional"" now and dropped reflections/discussion related to those. But perhaps most importantly, I have indeed relaxed my expectations of my students. I'm presenting due dates as being flexible, for example. I'm recognizing that students no longer have access to the physical library-- a problem because two of my classes were in the midst to research papers.  I've replaced what were planned as significant oral presentations with simpler recorded ones. And yes, I'm grading quite a bit more leniently than ever before in my 25+ years of teaching.

The reality is that even in my school where most (not all, but most) students are privileged some are struggling with the changes. A few still don't have reliable internet at home; others are living in homes with multiple siblings. At least two I know are now working in health care because they lost their on-campus jobs; one is working nights at a nursing home. In once case the student's family sold their home last fall and moved many states away and into a much smaller home, so there's not even a bedroom for her. More than one student has a family member with COVID-19 and I now know two who have lost extended family members to the disease. Others are struggling with fear, anxiety, and/or depression in the face of this unprecedented disruption.

So while some students are doing just fine and probably have enough time on their hands to do some extra work, many do not. I've instructed my faculty to be considerate in their expectations, to relax deadlines, and to feel free to cut back on assignments as they deem necessary. Most importantly, I've urged them to work with their students and above all use to be flexible given the varied circumstances. On Monday I spent almost two hours talking with one student who is struggling with the transition. I can do that because I'm teaching only about 45 students this semester-- for those of us at small, expensive colleges that one-on-one attention is about the only benefit they are still getting for their money.

Our faculty also voted to make pass/fail an option for all students in all courses right up to finals week. So those who want grades can have them, and any who don't feel up to it are only going to be held to the ""pass"" standard.",2020-04-09 05:02:43,fmv806i,1,academia
character-limits-suc,t2_1x5k5pr0,"The most important thing you said was that you have a boatload of crippling depression.  That’s important for two reasons. 

1. A lot of scientific discoveries are made by people who have suffered from depression.  There’s an evolutionary argument that depression suppresses certain cognitive distortions and helps people see/observe more effectively. 

2. Depression also CREATES cognitive distortions. You need to treat yours — you won’t lose anything by doing that — because it is giving you a destructive all-or-nothing tunnel vision and preventing you from seeing certain realities. 

The thing is, we live in a youth-obsessed culture that loves pyrotechnics and worships individual achievement. Please consider how the teachers of many of these people felt when they transformed the world, and the gratitude many of them felt to their teachers.  

A lot of geniuses — Gauss has a famous one —have biographies that include idiot teachers failing to recognize or even dismissing their gifts.  Valuing the fact that academia puts you in a position to help nurture others to achievement is a way to expand your own scope of influence and the possibilities for a meaningful life.  

A lot of geniuses also had team members we still don’t know the name of. Please read some books about the history of science and scientific discoveries.  This will help broaden your perspective.",2020-03-23 12:09:46,fl9pj17,1,academia

Most jobs under capitalism aren't good for mental health in some ways. But some of what you listed there (bipolar, psychosis) are not solely caused my external factors like a job.

This links to thinking with my friend - are people who are pre disposed to mental ill health drawn to academia for some reason? I know I suffered with depression long before my phd. Did the phd make it worse in ways? Hell yes. But a phd also gave me that freedom of schedule and work load to be able to step back and focus on myself in different periods. Because it wasn't 9 to 5 with demands I had to produce answers to by the end of the day. Academia gave me the space to work with my mental ebb and flow.

I have said for years that doing a PhD is like running your own business (you never really switch off, you're fully accountable) and being and artist (you expose your inner most creativity and thought for public criticism) at the same time. These are 2 pursuits which are incredibly stressful and anxiety inducing. So yes, academic work can be bad for us.

a_statistician,t2_ptowv,"Start by fixing yourself - therapy, treatment for depression, and screening for any other disorders that may affect your ability to work (like ADHD, which is sometimes not diagnosed early on - I was diagnosed in grad school). Then, once you've gotten yourself into a more functional place, you can apply for places with a personal statement that explains how you managed to publish several papers while dealing with XYZ demons, and now that you've managed to overcome those issues, you are able to focus. 

Simultaneously, reach out to any contacts in academia you have who may be willing to help you. I left academia to work for 3 years, and thanks to some really wonderful mentors, I managed to take a research assistant prof position for 2 years, then land a TT job. I'm kicking ass, if I do say so myself - my chair is actually freaking out because I have too many grants at the moment -- and those grants are all because my mentors set me up to be in the right places. They gave me opportunities they didn't have time to take, and those opportunities are going to make my career successful (at least, if I can manage to actually follow through, but I think I can). 

I got my PhD at 27, and went back to academia at 30. It's possible to pull this off, but you have to be in a good place mentally to do it, and you need to leverage any relationships you have in academia too.

DerProfessor,t2_flltr,"Because we *see* (on a daily basis) students who cannot handle college.  Students who should *not* be paying for an education, because they just do not have the emotional maturity or the intellectual skills. 

**Emotional maturity:**   what do I DO with a student who doesn't show up to class, doesn't read the syllabus, doesn't do the work, doesn't take any responsibility for their education whatsoever??!   

(It's the students who don't put the time in who end up in desperate straits at the end of the semester... it's them, mostly, who cheat/plagiarize, them who beg for exceptions, them who get aggressive and/or threatening.)    Maybe they're getting drunk every night at their frat;  maybe they're stoners;  maybe they have psychological/mental health/health issues (like serious depression, insomnia).  But most of the time, they just cannot make the shift from high school (which is required, and therefore feels like it should be ""resisted"") and college (which is chosen, and therefore should be fully engaged with.)  They are not getting anything out of their education... they are barely aware of it.  But a LOT of people are like this!  If you open up access to college to everyone, you'll just be increasing this group, which will just drag down the rest of the students.   The difference between an intro level course--where, at my university, about 10% of the students fall into this category--and an upper-level course, where 1% fall into it, is stunning.  GOOD students get a lot more out of a class filled with other good students.   They are dragged down by a class filled with absentee, lazy, unmotivated bad students. 

**Intellectual skills:**   this is tougher.   Some people are just not that bright.  Some are bright, but have been screwed by the horrible schools they found themselves shunted off to.   Brilliant students from horrible high schools can catch up.   Average students from horrible high schools cannot catch up.   And if they can't catch up... well, you end up with a problem that is sort-of similar to the one above, namely, the great students--who could get a tremendous amount out of the class--are slowed down by the underprepared students, who need a lot more explained, who need to be caught up on the basics.  I assign challenging writing assignments, that will make good students into excellent writers (and thereby, help to make their future).   But then what do I do with the students who can't understand the assignment?  Who literally cannot master it?  So, should I dial back the assignments--and rob the best students of their *only chance in life* to learn this stuff at this level???!   Or should I try to teach two versions of the class simultaneously--one advanced, one remedial?  Should there be different ""tracks"" in college, just like there are in many public high schools?   This is a really thorny problem... one not made any easier by many peoples' simplifications... ""we need to increase access!""   Sure, but bringing students who can't write into classes where advanced writing is required is just going to result in 1)  a lot of students failing, or 2)  a lot of advanced students, ready for serious writing, finding themselves stuck in a class where they are basically paying to repeat high school. 

The ""worry about graduation rates"" issue is really a worry of administrators.  There are reasons *aside* from the two above that many students don't graduate, and those can be (and need to be) grappled with effectively.

They were also my masters advisor and so we had a very well-established relationship.

I could tell we both struggled at lot at the beginning and over summer, being cutoff from the workplace where we really enjoyed being. I kept with it because I figured once they were relieved of childcare duties, they would be eager to return.

Although I no longer have multiple panic attacks per day I’ve had long-term mental health issues with depression, lacking motivation and imposter syndrome as a result. Honestly there were underlying issues, but the PhD was the straw that broke the camel’s back. 

I don’t regret starting my PhD, but I wish I had handled it better. I think the counselling next week is a great idea for you. 

I gather from your post that you are still young. If you can take a leave of absence to get yourself together it may not be a terrible idea. It may also be worthwhile seeing if there is another research group you can work with, office you can work in, or supervisory team available. This may mean exploring switching university. Obviously that isn’t ideal, but if the PhD is really something you want and the environment is problematic you need to do something about it. I’m not going to tell you you need to learn to work with people or in crappy environments because you are an adult and you know what’s a genuine issue and what you can fix or endure. If you’re drowning get out of the pool, don’t just wait to go under. 

A good resource, I’ve found, is Tara Brabazon’s YouTube videos from Flinders University in Australia. She’s a little quirky and when I first watched one I wasn’t sure about her, but she is genuinely the most amazing and helpful resource I’ve found. Incredibly intelligent and empathetic and full of great advice. 

Before pulling the plug I’d think about why it is that you started the PhD. If it’s something you need for your career you’ll have to weigh up if it’s worth it to you to follow that career path. If it’s to challenge yourself there are other ways to go about that if the PhD isn’t working for you- learn a language, climb a mountain, start a business. If it’s because of pressure from family/friends it’s not worth it- if they really care they will just want you to be happy. 

I hope this helps- if nothing else you’ll know that someone has read what you said and had difficulties, too.

SilkKheldar,t2_z3cd5,"For shame, that so many people here have been downvoting this post and discouraging you from pursuing a PhD altogether. And good for you for calling them out on it.  I completed my PhD a couple years ago, and am someone who struggles with both a learning difference and mental health. I didn't go into much detail about it when I was applying (though admittedly, in my experience, schools don't really offer a good way *to* be forthcoming about that information, other than identifying whether or not you have a disability with a checkbox), but discussed the matter with my supervisor *after* I received the admission offer.   


But these things absolutely affected my experience in the program. I was very fortunate to have a supervisor and committee (mostly) who were supportive and understanding, to say nothing of how fortunate I am to have a healthy and supportive family life, without which I don't know if I could have finished.  And that's sadly rare in academia: often, if mental health or learning differences are discussed at all (instead of being ignored, dismissed, etc.), quite often the attitude still very much is 1) ""Well, that's your problem, isn't it?""  2) ""Well, this is a very demanding program, and we need to maintain the standards of that program to ensure that these kinds of degrees remain prestigious, so maybe you should consider whether this is right for you?""  3) ""A PhD is hard, and we all had to go through it and survive, so surely you can, too.""  All of which suggest that dealing with mental health or learning differences somehow makes you less intelligent, adaptable, or otherwise capable of doing a PhD.  Sometimes, even when a school IS understanding, the response still falls along the lines of ""Well, we're sympathetic, and we can do some accommodation, but we must avoid any hint that we're treating you differently than other students,"" because the attitude about accommodation is still very much centered on this notion that helping a student with challenges is giving them some sort of advantage, or putting things on ""easy mode"" while other students don't get that - when in reality it's simply balancing things out a bit to give you a fair chance.  


Heck, at my university's student accessibility services office, I learned that undergrads and grads are treated fundamentally differently.  If an undergrad is in some way differently abled, they register, develop a learning plan with the office's staff, and then that office informs the student's respective faculty/department/professors of what *will be done* to accommodate that student's needs. That instruction comes with the backing of administrative authority, and overrides any and all professors' whims or opinions.  For grads? ""Oh, well, we can discuss your needs here, and we'll be in the conversation, but typically your supervisor is the person you'll have to develop a plan with, since you're working directly with them. Once you two have agreed on a solution, we'll file it here and so the school will enforce that agreement.""  So, because of the nature of grad school (working directly with a supervisor rather than taking courses through a faculty), your accommodation comes down to what your supervisor is *willing* to do for you, and is therefore subject to all of their personal opinions and preconceptions about mental, physical health or learning differences.    


TL/DR: You should absolutely apply, and I applaud you for ignoring the (bad) advice of those suggesting you ""may not be able to handle"" a PhD. You can. I did. It will absolutely be difficult, and perhaps more so for you than for someone who doesn't have to contend with mental health.  I may not necessarily mention your depression on the application, but once you've been accepted, I think it'll be important to really meet your potential supervisor before choosing a school and mention it, to gauge their attitude.  There are also supports at university to help - you may have to fight occasionally for the accommodation you need. BUT APPLY!",2020-01-15 14:08:59,fegmm3g,1,academia
Ltrfsn,t2_1awfeeeo,Hmmm something really fucked up is going on in academia because I'm hearing so many PhD students say it's depression inducing. This can't go on like this,2020-01-15 14:04:11,fegm8wq,1,academia
Jibeh,t2_9mfqk,"Sure, it's possible. I'm a TT instructor at a large university. I'm going up for tenure this year (file submitted, committee optimistic). The last three years at this job (out of four) I've been depressed, with therapy and medication helping little to none. Main symptoms fatigue, anhedonia, and hopelessness.

I'm in no position to give you advice on how to manage work and depression. (I'm also personally quite exhausted from hearing other people's advice.) But you asked whether it's possible, and the answer is ""yes."" Below are some notes from my experience.

Here are some things that work well:

* As far as keeping it together at work, *grad school trained me for exactly this scenario*. I pulled 80 hour weeks, doing research that may or may not work out, taking courses from joyless gate-keepers, attending seminars I didn't understand, plastering a smile on my face to teach. I have an amazing capacity to grind through work and pretend that nothing is wrong. Somehow when I'm not able to take a shower, I'm still able to edit a grant proposal. Also, now that I've settled into my job, I need fewer hours in the day to do my work, so it's like some school-related activities were replaced with depression-related activities.
* My job has awesome health benefits. I've been seeing psychologist that I really like, and without rationing visits I haven't yet overrun my counselling allowance. If I did overrun my counselling allowance, I'm paid well enough that it wouldn't matter. Medication is dirt cheap.
* My department has a strong culture of being terrible with email. So when I shut down and don't answer any emails for a week and a half, it's not a big deal. I come back with ""apologies for my late reply..."" and nobody bats an eye.
* I have my own office, with a desk I can crawl under. If I close the door, nobody knows whether I'm in or not.

Here are some things that work poorly:

* People starting out in academic careers get scattered to the four winds. You'll move to a place where you don't know anybody. You make academic friends, then they leave you for other positions.
* My school in particular has a shamefully high student-to-teacher ratio, especially in first-year courses (which are the bulk of my teaching load). Compassion fatigue feeds into normal fatigue. A lot of my students have quite serious mental health struggles, and I feel extra unequipped to support them. (Plus, nothing feeds into the cycle of hopelessness quite like a thousand first-year students treating the class discussion forum like it's 4Chan. Ugh.)
* Everybody complains all the time, and I don't have the mental resources to put it into a suitable context. A student complained that the assignment was poorly written, when in fact they just hadn't learned the things being evaluated? Clearly, the entire institution is a sham and I'm a part of it. Best to just give up. (Probably everybody complains all the time in non-academic jobs as well, but I have no experience in this so-called ""real world."")",2019-09-24 19:06:21,f1c823d,1,academia

guynamedgrandma,t2_aa3hu,"I hope I can add some perspective as someone who is about a decade ahead of you.

1. You are not alone in these feelings.  I struggle with burnout (from job-related anxiety and depression) and imposter syndrome.  The demands are high and the amount of criticism and rejection in science is ridiculous. But, having those thoughts and receiving criticism on your work does not mean you aren't capable, and they aren't criticizing YOU.  Behind close doors, all of my friends in the field admit that this is hard and they don't know exactly what they are doing.

2. Every study has its flaws, especially at the PhD level.  By the time I get a paper published, I'm usually not that excited by it because I intimately know everything wrong with it!  I've had grant applications just trashed, and that feeling sucks. But, those flaws are things I can begin to address with the next study or application. You don't have to have an impactful dissertation project.  Really, you're demonstrating that you have some form of applicable skills and perseverance.  Don't discount the problem solving you've had to do to get where you are.  Take it on with a ""growth mindset"" that the process makes you wiser, regardless if the dissertation is deemed a success or not.  This is, admittedly, tough to do.

3. Try not to compare yourself to others.  Everyone has different backgrounds, different circumstances, different health concerns, different mentorship, different resources, different strengths, different weaknesses, different forms of curiosity/passion.  You're not an idiot just because you have the shortest CV in the room.  It may just be that you're in a well-respected room.  It's ok to not want to be the ""rock star"" of your field.

4.  Even if you ""fail"" in epic fashion (not finishing or failing the dissertation), you have a LONG WAY TO FALL BEFORE YOU HIT ROCK BOTTOM.  Yes, debt is stressful, but you can work through it with time and planning.  Yes the effort of the last few years may seem wasted (sunk cost fallacy), but you have developed skills that other employers will value.  It seems that you are doing translational work in and advanced field.  This has value.

5.  Your brain is trying to protect you from a perceived threat, giving you the flight-or-fight stress response.  This made sense when we were threatened by dinosaurs (full disclosure: I'm not an evolutionary scientist or historian or neuroscientist), but it's a little bit of an overreaction (that we can't control easily) when we are threatened by deadlines and peer-review.  

6.  You have a girlfriend that you want to marry.  You are killing it at what matters in life.  Well done!

Good job getting help with therapy.  If that therapist doesn't help, find a new one.  They aren't perfect, either.",2019-10-09 14:25:50,f333qft,1,academia
ChemicalTurnip,t2_2eoe6sz0,"My condolences.

I'm not sure how useful this might be, but there was a reddit post floating around a while back about [this](https://www.gwern.net/docs/math/1990-thomason.pdf) paper. I've quoted the relevant part below.


&gt;The  first  author  must  state  that  his  coauthor  and  close  friend,   Tom   Trobaugh,  quite  intelligent,  singularly  original,  and  inordinately   generous, killed  himself  consequent  to endogenous  depression.  Ninety-four  days  later,  in  my  dream,  Tom's  simulacrum  remarked,  ""The  direct  limit  characterization   of  perfect   complexes  shows  that   they  extend,  just   as  one  extends  a  coherent  sheaf.""   Awaking  with  a  start,  I  knew  this  idea  had  to  be  wrong,  since  some  perfect  complexes  have  a  non-vanishing  KQ obstruction  to  extension.   I  had  worked  on  this  problem  for  3  years,  and saw  this  approach  to  be  hopeless.   But  Tom's  simulacrum  had  been  so  insistent,  I  knew  he wouldn't  let  me  sleep  undisturbed  until  I had  worked  out  the  argument  and  could  point  to  the  gap.  This  work  quickly  led  to  the  key  results  of  this  paper.   To  Tom,  I  could  have  explained  why  he  must  be  listed  as  a  coauthor.   During  his  lifetime,  Tom  also  pointed  out  the  interesting  comparison  of  the  careers  of  Grothendieck  and  Newton.",2020-12-07 19:23:25,gez2lbl,1,academia
leSchaf,t2_11oo41,"Okay, so you are just reading through a bunch of papers because you're interested in the topic.

A PhD thesis requires you to compile your own findings to answer a novel question relevant to your field. In STEM, most PhD Student do their own experiments that provide data from which they draw the insights to answer their research question. You do new experiments because typically the data to answer the relevant research questions of the field doesn't exist yet. This still requires you to read a ton and you will cite lots papers in your thesis because the literature informs your experimental design and the Interpretation of your data. In the humanities, the relevant data is often hidden within literature. Your job then is to find the relevant information which often requires you to read between the lines, compile that and draw new conclusions.

For a PhD thesis in neuroscience, it wouldn't be enough to read literature and then write about e.g. which transmitters have been found to be involved in depression because you haven't provide new findings, you have just compile existing findings in one place.

Perhaps you yould do a meta-analysis of existing studies. For example, the importance of neurotransmitter A in depression is really controversial in the field, there are a number of studies with contradictory conclusions. You could then analyze all those studies, find measure the objectively compare them, do some statistics.

You would probably need to initiate the project because these types of theses are so rare. You would need to have a really promising topic for that. As someone who doesn't have a PhD in the field yet, it can be very hard to identify such a topic. You would need to reach out to professors the field. If you already have some connections from your master's where you already worked with professors that would be very helpful. It would also probably help to talk to a professor that you have a good connection with about how such a project could look.",2021-01-11 14:40:11,givvahw,1,academia

I don't think that you mean to give this impression, but a logical extrapolation from what you've written is that the many, many, many tenure-track-less phds out there that spent 60-70 hours a week for 5-10 years straight just didn't work hard enough, weren't disciplined enough and didn't love what they did enough. Those lazy people should have worked 75 hours a week! 

The thing with grad school is that everyone is at least very good and many are amazing. We're talking about a group of people where the ""dumb ones"" are the ones that only had 3.5 GPAs in undergrad or only won 3 major scholarships prior to finishing their bachelors. So you get a bunch of these high achievers together and make them compete for a decreasing number of tenure track positions. It's not irregular for there to be 200 applicants for a single tenure track position - each one of them having at least a PhD. 

My advice is: If you love it so much that even if you don't get tenure and even if there is no other career available to you with this degree that in and of itself justifies alll of your invested time and effort, you still won't regret having gone. You still will look back favourably on your choice to get a phd and the time you had. If you can't afford to not get tenure, you're begging for anxiety and depression the likes of which you have probably never seen before.
