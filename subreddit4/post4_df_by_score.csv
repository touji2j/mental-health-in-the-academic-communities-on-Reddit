Bill_Nihilist,t2_aqijs,2019-07-08 19:15:22,capi0c,275,"My background is in biomedical research, and I'm currently a research scientist, applying for TT positions. I've been struggling with the idea of training my own graduate students and for years now I've been reluctant to encourage undergraduates to continue on to grad school. Every time an undergraduate research assistant has expressed interest in pursuing a PhD, I've tried to explain to them the enormity of the deck stacked against them. To wit:

* Compared to other highly educated people in the general population, PhD students are about [2.5 times](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733317300422) more likely to be at risk for depression and other psychiatric disorders.  About [one in three](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733317300422) end up with symptoms of a psychiatric disorder. 

* For [80%](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0184130) of grad students, an academic career is the goal, but just over [10%](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6286/663) actually achieve a faculty position. And those 10% are not equally distributed across institutions, but disproportionately come from elite institutions [1-3], the kinds of which I will most likely not be teaching at.

* [Most](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6266/1367) biomedical PhDs end up having to do a postdoc, but postdoc [salaries](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00587-y) are lower than that of a new [college graduate](https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/14/pf/college/class-of-2018-starting-salary/index.html) even though the postdoc is working [50+](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/63/4/245/253174) hours per week and is [9](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsf18304/datatables/tab27.htm) years older than the new college grad. 

* [20%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733318302312#sec0030) of postdocs report having existential crises related to their careers.

* If the postdoc goes into industry, their salary ([~$48K/yr](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2015/12/09/350.6266.1367.DC1/aac5949_Zolas-SM.pdf) )  is still less than the median new college grad (~50K/yr) AND it's unlikely the private sector biology PhD will be able to continue doing research [4-5]. Indeed, if the postdoc sticks with research, they can expect to be paid [less](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0241). 

* Moreover, several studies agree that there isn’t any evidence a postdoc will actually benefit seekers of non-academic jobs [6-8]. When comparing private sector workers 10 years post-PhD, the salary of those who went the postdoc route are [$12,000](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3766) lower than those who skipped postdocs altogether. 

So if I encourage someone to go to grad school, I'm essentially putting them on a path toward some pretty dire consequences for their career, especially if they do a postdoc, which most will. If they're not getting paid well, they're not getting training that can help them thrive outside of academia, and they're miserable, how can I justify telling them to go this route? 

I think I'm a pretty good mentor. I think my research is important. But I'm realistic about the prospects of my trainees. They're not all going to end up in tenured faculty positions, and the numbers concerning the alternatives are all pretty grim. I can try my best to make sure my students aren't stressed out horribly, but I can't do anything to ensure they'll have meaningful, fulfilling jobs in science that actually pay enough to make grad school worthwhile. 

So how do you do it? How do we as mentors look our students in the eyes and tell them to ignore the statistics and persevere, hoping they'll be one of the few to buck the trends?

# Mental Health Struggles
This sufficiently answers a query put forth by /lindenlinden69er 

*I suppose what I am asking is: were you unhappy during the PhD?*

Right off the bat I need to address the mental health struggles that come with this kind of work. I received three(!!!) private messages from users who wanted to privately express to me that they were happy I posted what I did because they were up against similar negative outcomes and experiencing intense anxiety and depression as a result. One messenger had even gone on academic leave because of it. I have also struggled with anxiety and depression throughout grad school. **Please take care of yourself and get help early and often, on campus or elsewhere.**  I intend to write a full post on this topic at a future date.


---

# Who Are You?
A lot of comments asking for more details about my situation. I wish I could give them but I am terrified of being doxxed - it would probably destroy my academic job prospects. To recap from the other thread and elaborate a bit more: 

- In an Arts/Humanities discipline
- ABD
- Diss written
- Defense scheduled
- Work presented at all major conferences in discipline
- Work presented at major conferences in tangential disciplines
- Multiple solo-author pubs
- Teaching experience
- 0% success rate after 113 applications submitted to various academic and industry positions
- “Fully funded” - according to university calculations for cost of living, etc. (I was politely told to fuck off when I explained to the department head that their calculations were very low for the area where the university is.)
- Still have accruing debt from undergrad/master’s and have taken out loans to offset cost of living during PhD. Large debt now.

# Pyramid Scheme

/u/lumabugg points out:

*The PhD market is oversaturated because it’s the only way big universities can afford to teach everyone, while knowing full well most students won’t get a tenure-track job because too many people graduate from PhD programs (while the colleges continue to use grad student labor instead of hiring more faculty). Meanwhile, we were brought up with this idea that if you just work harder, you’ll succeed, which has created a bunch of graduate students and post-docs who have convinced themselves that their lack of career prospects is their own moral failing and not the failing of a system that churns out more graduates than the market could ever handle.*

This enhances the point on **Mental Health Struggles** above. **The lack of career prospects is not your fault. There is a systemic corruption that is inherent in this system. Information about such corruption is not highly visible, that’s what inspired me to write my last post.** Can you imagine if I shared my real name with the last post? It would be instant academic career suicide! In this manner, the institution protects itself from any dissenting voices. Lack of these dissenting voices cause otherwise mentally healthy individuals to question if they have “done enough” by getting a PhD (something that less than 1% of the population had accomplished). 

In case it needs said - I think you have worth as a human, and if you’re getting a PhD you likely have an above average IQ and are at least somewhat more industrious than most of the general population.

---

# Rationalize, Rationalize, Rationalize
Instead of getting justifiably angry at a systemic problem - an emotion that may lead to systemic change - countless commenters offered advice on modifying my job hunt. I appreciate the good advice, but others suggested that I leave the US behind for greener…err beiger pastures. /u/duderightnow comments:

*I’d say try one of the Persian Gulf countries (Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, etc)*

# The University Question
/u/ph0rk responds to my assertion the the university is on the decline:

*I assume you meant enrollment. Enrollment is on the decline in small regional schools and less prestigious LACs. Large research universities are seeing an enrollment increase.*

Agreed. Without giving out doxxable information, I can report that my own institution just set a major record in this regard. I am not suggesting that enrollment will take a massive and immediate hit. **Instead, I am suggesting that the value proposition of college-as-service is failing. A weak value proposition is the harbinger of massively decreasing enrollment.** 

I encourage you to hit the pavement and ask undergraduates some questions. I make a point to socialize regularly with undergraduates on campus not involved in my own classes. Most of them in the first couple of years of study report that **they are attending college largely because it was expected of them by their parents, or for some other status-signaling reason.** Once it becomes common knowledge among a new generation of parents that college has no value proposition in terms of new knowledge to be acquired, attendance will severely and maybe irreversibly drop.

---

# Boomer Logic
/u/brock_coley suggests that I’m not trying hard enough:

*For instance, go to specialised job fairs to network and introduce yourself, make yourself known to industry headhunters, make friends with privious grads who are now in industry, look up people on linkedin in the companies/positions you want to work in and ask them out for an informational coffee. Just as you are probably ready to relocate for an academic job, you should also expect to move for a good industry-based job.*

[Which inevitably comes off like this.](https://i.imgur.com/DXhOUy4.jpg)

---

# Industry Work

/u/nbbby27 asks:

*“Why is the PhD a count against you in industry?”*

Some good answers in the comment area but none illustrating the main issue I have had with this - those in industry don’t want to hire PhDs because they  believe us to be overqualified, i.e. they won’t be able to offer a good enough salary to keep us. Corollary - PhDs are a risky hire because as soon as that R1 job offer comes up we’ll leave. This is actually what I’m planning on doing. **I’ll get whatever industry job I can drum up, tell them that I don’t want anything to do with academia anymore, and leave immediately when I get a good offer from a school. I have no conscience about burning a system that’s stacked against us.**

---

# Other Paths
/u/pastaandpizza muses:

*Why not pursue “virtually any other path” than a PhD, right now ie if you were qualified for excellent industry jobs or other non-phd jobs before you pursued your PhD, surely you’re still competitive for those same paths now?*

You’re right those paths are still mostly valid, and this is largely what I intend on doing. It is now a very uphill battle though. Consider it from the non-academic’s point of view, this is what they see - one candidate with 5 years of solid industry experience, another candidate that was in school for 5 years, probably slacking off and avoiding the real world - who do you think they will choose? I have received numerous rejection letters from industry jobs so far that say I don’t have enough real-world experience. 

---

I think that summarizes most of what was generally brought up in the last thread. Many of you in humanities/arts PhDs are going to come up against the same struggle I’m up against right now. For this reason, I ask all of you, **What do we do about this broken system?** I think not only could this be a productive discussion, but also bring up possible solutions or workarounds that will be actionable for current and future grad school graduates.

I have been experiencing chronic depression over the past three years. I have tried meds, therapy, meditation, diets, praying, you name it, I've done it.

This illness has been so debilitating that I failed to reach the ""standards"" of my doctoral program... and so I got dismissed. My advisor is well aware of what I am going through, but still, I am booted. I could not take a leave of absence as it would jeopardize my student visa, funding, and on-going health care. Oh well. I am still at the stage of grieving and my thoughts are sporadic.

I wish unis would adopt a policy to not drop a student due to their illness.

I wish to rectify all my failed assignments, exams, and grades.

Where do I go from here? I love school and literature to death. I feel like it’s my whole world. I put all my eggs into one basket then dropped the basket. I just always assumed that because I loved literature so so much and put everything into it there would be a teaching job for me somewhere, whether at a nice high school or a college. But now I realize that even getting a job at a high school is tough these days. Outside of teaching I have absolutely no clue what I’d want to do or be remotely capable of. I feel severely underprepared and useless to society. And my mental health is so damn fragile at the moment as you can see from this post that I don’t know how I’m going to survive any of it, the rejections, the criticisms, I need to get tougher skin. I’m a mess. 


I don’t know what to do. I mean I have no real strengths to go on. I was given all these resources and I’m just not doing anything with it. 

I’m still have a year or two left in college. I always wanted to be a professor. Wanted to get a PhD, teach, research all of it. English and art classes and reading and research have always been the most important things in my life. I just really thrived on the ideas, getting so absorbed in them, I felt I would . I felt so at ease and joyful and fascinated when writing papers and reading theory. Philosophy, literature, art criticism. It has consumed my life and given it a lot of meaning and value and joy. In fact, it’s been a bit of a crutch so that I feel addicted. On summer breaks I feel like I’m withdrawing. I hated snow days growing up. I’d live at school if I could. 

I struggled with burnout and my mental health in college. Though I’m still totally in love with literature and writing and doing research, my grades have dropped because I have become paralyzed by perfectionism, distracted by some unfortunate romantic fixations and battling with substance abuse and a bipolar disorder diagnosis and a lot anxiety. For so many reasons I’ve come to realize I will never be an academic or live the intellectual “life of the mind.” It’s just not realistic and I’ve screwed up too many times and even for the perfect candidate it’s basically impossible. 

I went to one of the most selective, expensive small liberal arts universities. I received a fantastic literary education that I cherish but that also embarrasses me. I feel selfish and self-indulgent and stupid And confused and lost and useless and like a disappointment to everyone around me.

I’m being so dramatic I don’t know what’s wrong with me or how you are even reading this far without puking but I guess I suddenly just realized that I have virtually no skills or assets and that people who didn’t even go to college, or went to much “lesser-tier” colleges, are likely more or at least equally equipped for the vast majority of jobs as me.

I have ADD, slow processing speed, anxiety, depression etc. and while I know those labels don’t define me, they are pretty darn consistent throughout my life despite therapy and meds. Even when I’m relatively “normal,“ in terms of functioning, I will always be more scatterbrained, forgetful, unassertive and inefficient than the vast majority of people. And I don’t have strengths to counterbalance it. Not useful strengths.No employer would want me! 

Sure, I am “creative” (or so I am told) but I’ve never felt it came to any use. I can’t come up with novel solutions to actual problems or anything. I’m not quick on my feet. I am defensive and try to avoid criticism as much as possible instead of learning from it. I’m horrendously bad with time management even when I work on it, and have improved, I’m still far worse than most. I’m very messy and disorganized no matter how hard I try to stay neat. And my speaking and communication style is so indirect and tangential it drives most people crazy. I am capitalism’s worst nightmare. But also just most people’s worst nightmare of a person. I’m essentially a child. 

I’m not even really a good writer. I’m long-winded, slow, confusing, hyperbolic, disorganized and never sure what to include or leave out. 

My only strengths and talents are hardly useful or desirable on the job market: “original, interesting, nice, authentic, in touch my emotions, introspective, insightful, abstract, philosophical, obsessively enthusiastic about certain topics, interested in the mysteries of the universe blah blah blah...” 

Like I can’t think of a single reason anyone in any real life job would want to hire me. I feel worthless and useless and like an “extra” unnecessary little human who is trying to find a place in a world where she’s frankly not needed or wanted.",AskAcademia,"Always dreamed of becoming an academic, intellectual, or artist.

My father knows I have been under a lot of stress and upset because of that.  I don't talk much with him as he is also a part of my anxiety issues. He is too interfering and likes to have his way all the time. He has forced decisions on me when I was a kid just become he thought it was right and would never ever listen to my opinion or what I want because he is the man of the house who makes decisions and everyone else is just supposed to obey and never question. His irresponsible decisions regarding my studies and then forcefully imposing them on me has affected my career a lot. So He found the mail address of my chairman online and mailed him and the man I worked with for sometime without telling me or consulting me. 

I am soooo angry and embarrassed. He has terrible social skills and wherever he goes he picks a fight. Idk why he doesn't understand how terribly vengeful and egoistic faculties can be. And btw who does that. I am not a school student anymore. It's my professional life and it can hurt me badly in future even if he was polite in his mail. It will come across as if I am a kid who can't handle adult responsibilities :/

I have been under a lot of pressure already, I fell sick and have been going in and out of depression and he is making my life worse like he always has. I just hope the faculties will be understanding as I apologized and said I wasn't aware of this.

KhutulunKhatun,t2_2q07xmdb,2019-08-21 18:08:48,ctklyd,96,"Here's the deal. I applied to 12 grad schools for political science studying contemporary China in the 2018 cycle and did not get into any of them. I don't know why I was rejected completely - I was told by my advisors and grad school admissions staff that my application made me a strong candidate, I have internships and a great GRE, and I had great personal recommendations - but just that there weren't enough spaces and very vague advice about 'fit'.

I'm not completely helpless though. I had my masters in public policy and I have a job (just under $20/hr and with great health insurance) in university administration where I'm using my Chinese language skills. So I could be worse off. But I'm just coming out of a nasty cycle of high-functioning depression and now that my mental health is getting better I'm looking for ways to boost my application for next time - I don't know if it'll be this cycle, but maybe the next one.  

I've talked to several professors of mine and they've suggested working on a study-abroad research fellowship in Taiwan to give my language skills that further boost, and I'm working with a former thesis supervisor of mine on an essay on stages of US foreign policy that might be published soon. Not in a peer-review journal, though, but more likely a regional affairs website and a public affairs magazine. 

I've also entertained the idea of teaching as an adjunct for a semester at a local community college to at least see if I'm suited for teaching and to see if I can contribute in some way. 

I do have my MPP already. I've thought about working in government but a few applications I have fell through there as well. So I'm really not sure where to go. I've felt stagnant over the last few months and I want to get out of this rut.

jesuisperdu,t2_61gcm,2016-04-23 14:03:32,4g3l1l,76,"Dear AskAcademia,


It was 9 months ago that I poured my heart out here and you guys read my words and gave me the strength I needed to push forward [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/3eb7aa/after_eight_years_of_phd_im_consumed_by_fear_i/). **Thank you!!!**

I wish my update was exclusively happy, but an interaction that I had yesterday with my advisor has made it bittersweet, and I'm still trying to make sense of it. I'll give you the full story.


After my last post, I read ALL of the books you guys recommended. What can I say? They were fantastic! I learned to be mindful and my depression went away, I learned how to make good habits and get rid of bad ones, I lost the few extra pounds I had gained due to eating when anxious, and I stopped, cold-turkey, taking Prozac. I felt good and I managed to **finish my thesis!!!** It has gone through my committee, and it is now with the board of examiners (I don't know the proper name in English, but the doctors who will evaluate me when I defend my thesis). I have received 3 postdoc offers from researchers in my Institute, and even my advisor has offered me two different postdoc options to continue with him.


However, *this will become very relevant*, I took out a loan to cover my food and rent expenses during all these months. Juggling working while trying to finish my thesis and publish all of my chapters (which my advisor insisted I do) was a huge source of stress. My advisor likes to see us in the lab all day, so I always felt guilty while at work.


The day before yesterday, a colleague sent me a link to a postdoctoral research fellow position in Europe and, when I read it, I could not believe it! I'm a good candidate for it, since I have all the essential attributes they listed and most of the desirable ones. Also, their line of research is very interesting and in the direction I want to go, more conservation. And yet, I was not considering doing a postdoc outside of the city I'm currently at, because my husband is here working on his PhD and needs a couple more years to finish. However, the money for this postdoc is 3 times as much as the money I can get for a postdoc in my country, and I could pay the money I owe to the bank. Also, it starts this summer, whereas the call for postdocs in my country comes out until January, and I won't start working until June of next year.


I spent hours talking with my husband about me doing this postdoc. I hadn't told him how much money I owed, or how the interests are pilling up, because I did not want to burden him. I've already put a lot of stress on him because of the depression I went through. He was very supportive and understanding. He told me he would figure out how to get the money, but I asked him not to. His student scholarship is just enough for him and he is already overworked. He said that I should apply, that I needed to get away from my advisor and that I would be some sort of Phoenix and become great again, like I once was. That he would visit me whenever he could. I cried, we hugged for hours and I decided to apply. It was not an easy decision, my husband is my life.


Yesterday I started the application process. I felt confident with our decision and excited about the possibility of being accepted. Then I reached the part in which they asked me for the contact details of my current boss. I filled that part out and decided to let him know that, if they considered me a good enough candidate to interview, that they might call him. What happened next killed me. Perhaps I'm oversensitive or he is an ass**le, maybe both.

I asked him if he had a few minutes and he took me to his office. I explained that I wanted to apply for a postdoc and gave him the specifics, told him that I consider myself a good candidate and, that if they thought so too, they might give him a call. I'll try to quote him as best as I can:

Him: ""You're skilled, but you're slow. When they call me and ask me why it has taken you so long to deliver, what am I going to say to them? It is a highly competitive position, and they are looking for someone who delivers in reasonable time.""


I felt so little. He sounded aggressive and I couldn't understand why. I felt broken again and crushed. Yes, it will take me 9 years to graduate, I once heard that the average time for his students is 8 years. Yet I have more manuscripts than any of his other students, 4 as first author and 3 as second author. 


When he said that, I felt that I had to justify myself. And while I was struggling to do so, I felt like a toddler trying to form coherent arguments and failed. At least, I didn't cry. If you guys are interested, or if you think it is relevant, I'll try to remember what I said and all the other hurtful things he said next.


But this interaction with him has made me doubt myself again. I now imagine myself alone very far away from my husband, in a very cold place, and wonder if I can actually do it. I know that what they need of me, won't be easy, and I'll need to work very hard to get it done. 


To make me doubt even more, it will be in the Country where my advisor was born, what if I get another advisor like him? But honestly, after how this conversation went, I don't think I'll be accepted. I know he won't spare the flaws he sees in me, and he is a harsh judge. 


I'm left wondering if his reaction is normal, do advisors commonly act like this when you're graduating and looking to move on? Is he worried that I'll embarrass him if I don't deliver? I don't think its personal because I'm sure he does like me. We get along quite well as long as he is not revising my work. Though my husband has mentioned stockholm syndrome. 


I'm lost. Should I apply?

I'm on track to defend at the end of next year. But my relationship with my adviser has become such a mess that I'm not sure what to do. I'm female and he's male, and he's about ten years older than me. (I'm in my late 20's).

It started around the end of my first year: we got very close, very fast, and were in constant communication. It all seemed platonic, but I became more and more dependent on him, and he warned me against forming relationships with other professors in the department. Eventually, I became a pariah in the program, in part, I think, because my adviser and I were so close, and some viewed it as inappropriate.

But during that second year, a pattern started to develop. He would say something negative, or undermining, or downright mean (""Don't embarrass yourself by presenting this paper at that conference."" ""Your work isn't good."" ""You're a poor reflection of me as an adviser."" ""That journal will never accept your article."" \[It did, by the way.\]) I started walking on eggshells around him when it came to certain subjects, because if I got too close to them, he attacked, and it was mean. This pattern has persisted: he says these hurtful things, I get upset, and then he gets mad I'm upset, and tells me I'm the problem, and not him -- he's the ""perfect adviser."" It makes me incredibly depressed. Nothing I do is right in his eyes -- despite performing well professionally, and winning a prestigious award from my university's graduate school.

Ironically, he can be a really good adviser -- very supportive most of the time. He isn't always negative. But the times he is, it sends me into a deep depression. I've even felt suicidal about it, and started therapy and medication. What makes it worst is he has never apologized for the way he behaves, ever. At best, he gives me some sort of gift, or takes me out to lunch, after we have a fight, and pretends like nothing happened.

I don't think any of this is normal, but I can't switch advisers. He seems to get upset when I try to distance myself from him. I don't have any real friends in the department.

I moved halfway across the globe to pursue a PhD in the only topic that kind of interests me. I've been [chronically depressed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia) for basically as long as I can remember (which is a little different than [clinical depression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder)), but it's hitting me extra hard now, because what I'm doing is no longer easy and I have no social life to fall back on (it was never much, but still much better than here).

I've been prescribed different kinds of antidepressants and I'm seeing a psychiatrist, but none of it seems to do anything. I'm alternating between periods of low productivity and extremely low productivity, where I can regularly not even bring myself to get out of bed and to the university, and I don't think my supervisor notices. In a previous bad period I did tell her and she responded pretty understanding, but all subsequent talks were just business-as-usual. This is probably mostly due to me because I've been dealing with this for a long time and since people don't like a downer and I don't like talking about it, the facade of acting like nothing is wrong has become my default behavior over the past 15+ years.

Now she wants me to finish some stuff that I should have done ages ago and isn't even that difficult, but I'm greatly struggling with it and have made virtually no progress over the past year. I should probably have written ""I can't"" rather than ""I'm struggling"", but that seems so stupid. I can read, I can write, I'm supposed to be pretty smart, I'm sure I seem relatively healthy to anyone who sees me, and it even feels to me that I could easily get back into it and make significant progress tomorrow because it's not that goddamn difficult. But I always feel that way, and it almost never happens. I guess I'm waiting for the day that it does (not a great plan, I know), but I'm afraid my supervisor's patience is rightfully going to run out when she really sees the lack or progress or learns how I spend most of my time. My career is pretty much all I have in life, so losing it would be very bad (although perhaps not undeserved).

I don't really know what to do any more. I already tried antidepressants, talking to a psychiatrist and my supervisor and none of it ""helped"".

To make a long story sort of short, in the last year of my M. Sc. I was suffering from severe depression, anxiety issues due to an abusive supervisor's personal dislike for me and the events revolving around that in addition to post sugery physical health issues. Once I finished my thesis, I was crippled by these mental health issues for 8 more months until my treatment for them reduced them to very manageable levels. 

During the time before I felt better, my co-supervisor, who I did actually along with well, offered to help me push one of the papers from my thesis to publication, stating that he understood the issues I was going through and was happy to help effectively finish it for me. I thanked him and he did most of the work for publication, which included redoing most of the analyses and some figures and retooling the discussion and conclusion. I was always involved with this and constantly discussed the changes, their results and conclusions, even if I didn't write much of the text ( I actually did write nearly a page of once I was feeling normal again, though).

However, just recently as the paper is near submission, he has suddenly asked if he can be first author on it. This came as a complete shock as I always assumed I would be first author as I did 90% if the work up until he edited it at the end when I literally could not for months. Even the abusive supervisor who I had issues with has said I need these first authored papers to jumpstart my career/ PhD search, and they don't as they are now retired. It just feels like he took advantage of my health issues for an easy paper, and I don't know how to approach this and say that it isn't right? 

Let me know how you all might handle this situation. I'm at a loss.

In particular, my parents refuse to support me on depression treatment, so I need to separate from my parents in order to get treatment (I need new health insurance too).   But it's also bigger than that -- I'm afraid of my parents because of their abusive history, and because they continue to do things like hire a P.I. to stalk my sibling and harass her. I need to separate, but in order to pay rent and expenses by myself I'll need to work full-time (and then some). So I'll need to take at least a year off school.

dom11285,,2017-06-25 10:54:39,6jdr6i,62,"I finished my PhD in 2015, and got a job at a college on a two-year contract. As an academic, you have to be constantly researching and publishing. A major expectation is that you publish your PhD dissertation as a book soon after you get the degree. 

In revising the dissertation, I discovered what I thought were significant coding errors, and also found out that other works had been published which made it significantly less original. I began to think that the project was futile, as the coding corrections meant that the book would no longer have a clear argument. I spent months trying to find a way to rework the project, getting more and more panicked about it. This obsession led me to stop researching and publishing altogether, and I believed that I had failed and my career was over. I fell into depression. 

Convinced that it was over and that I was a failure and would be discovered as a failure, I isolated myself from my research network, and am now no longer invited onto any conference panels.

As my contract was coming to an end, and trying to run away from my PhD project, I proposed an entirely new research project in job applications. I was offered, and accepted, a one-year research fellowship at a different university on the basis of this new research project. As I have progressed in my depression counselling, I have realised that there is a justifiable basis for what I thought were my ""coding errors"" with my PhD dissertation. I now have renewed confidence in this PhD project and want to get back to it. Simultaneously, in preparing for the second project, I have discovered that the scenarios it would research are actually exceedingly remote, to the point of folly. There is new literature on this, pointing this out, that has been published since I sent in the application. I am no longer comfortable with this topic, or in presenting on it as an ""original research question"" to a panel of very senior experts in my field.

Two people who were very close to me (my advisor and a friend in academia) have both committed suicide in the past few years. I know a number of other very intelligent, talented academics who have had suicide attempts, inpatient stints, on and off a number of medications for depression, etc.

Now, of course, I'm not so naive to think that these issues are exclusive to just the academic world - BUT - I'm wondering if there's a higher prevalence of these issues, and if that's related to: the type of people academia attracts, the pressure of the academic workload and life, or a combination of these, or other factors.

The reason I'm posing this question is that it seems like a quiet storm that nobody wants to openly discuss and address, which is very upsetting considering that people I love are dead, or have almost died.

Seeing what I've seen, I'm reluctant to continue down an academic career path.

youthrwwy,,2017-12-19 17:06:48,7kulfh,59,"When I finished my masters I felt like I was at the top of the world: my CV included engineering experience, some international internship both in industry and research, and a Master Thesis produced in one of the best institutions in my field in the world, as well as some publications in very good journals.

I got 4 PhD offers: 1 in the UK, one in Australia, and 2 in other western European countries. 

I chose one of the two in Western Europe because it was in a very renowned institution that I greatly admire. It is the kind of place that I have in my conference badge and people go ""wow, you must be smart!"". 

It is now evident to me that it was the worst possible choice I could have made.

* From the beginning, my supervisor refused to give me any hints on what type of project he would want me to pursue, but disliked any idea I had.

* Any attempt I made to maintain collaborations with other institutes/researchers was shut down, and even collaborations with other departments in the same institute were frowned upon (on all sides)

* I ended up not actually based in ""renowned institute"", but in another department in the same program. People from ""renowned institute"" consider the research made in my department to be second class.

* After thinking long and hard, I realized the research made in my department is, in general, indeed very poor.

* From the beginning I was pushed to work with one of the most toxic personalities I have ever met, and this greatly delayed my work, and took a huge toll on my mental health.

* This is not an isolated incident. In this department there are people from all over the world, and some are way more vulnerable than others. It is an environment with a lot of toxic mechanisms, and the more senior professors either turn a blind eye to it, or are guilty of it themselves. It makes me really sad to just be here.

I spent my first year doing some very tricky work to come up with a project that my supervisor liked, and became more and more isolated as I was driven away from people I used to collaborate with. The only person ""approved"" for me collaborate was not only not helpful, but incredibly toxic. My self-esteem started to decline, and my mental health in general started to suffer. 

And then there is the personal side: The PhD studies take so much of my time, I haven't been able to learn the local language. I haven't been able to fully integrate with the local culture, and feel very isolated. And the local culture is very different from my own, and is known to be much more closed and cold. That doesn't help at all.
The reason why I didn't want to give up was that my partner had moved to this city to be with me. I felt very guilty of quitting/switching and to leave this person, who gave up on everything to follow me around, in a very uncertain situation.

I decided to push through. Tried my best, stood up to my bully, and worked on all of it mostly on my own, achieved a lot. 

And then my partner decided that this was not going to work (being in this country), and left. I started going to therapy, was diagnosed with depression. 
I HAD NEVER GONE THROUGH THAT BEFORE. I was going through of mix of extreme stress related to work, along with loneliness, homesickness, cultural and social alienation.

That made me rethink everything, and I honestly don't know what to do. Right now I am going to my home country and will write my next article from there, and benefit from the good weather and being close to friends and family. 

But what do I do? I don't know if I can make it another 1.5 years in a place I don't belong, being lonely and working in a toxic environment with people I don't respect. 

But I also don't see how I can abandon almost 2 years of work. 

I feel like these 2 years costed me so much. Right now I have zero sense of self-worth, my mental health has degraded to a point of ""I can barely leave the bed"", I lost an incredible, great relationship, I can't stop thinking of the other opportunities I lost, and, well... I feel like I lost 2 full years of my life! 


There is a lot of venting here, I am sorry for that. 
The type of advice I need is, are there PhD programs/supervisors out there that would accept someone who already completed 2/3 of a PhD program elsewhere? I could bring with me an incredible amount of work that could be developed into something really cool. Would that be considered a failure by prospective employers in the future? Should I just suck it up, get some depression medication and spend another 1.5 year here trying to be done with this as fast as possible?

jabberwock91,t2_rgshz,2019-09-26 02:34:08,d9dhx1,54," Hi,

I'm in my 3rd year of a PhD program, and I have obtained a Masters in another field (In a semi-related field, I'll say). Long story short, I have been struggling with depression and suicidal ideations for quite some time now since entering this PhD program. This stems from the fact that I feel PhD/academia life is simply not for me. I love the content my program, the faculty, my classmates &amp; cohort. But the overall idea of academic work life depresses me in magnitudes I cannot explain. I am uncomfortable with teaching and sitting down to write a manuscript or my dissertation is great at giving me thoughts of suicide. I've talked with family, friends (outside of my cohort) &amp; a therapist about this, but no one in my department is aware. I have so many fears of how this will affect people's perceptions of me.

***As you may have gathered, I think it's time for me to take steps towards leaving graduate school.***

I need to start by disclosing to my advisor, right? This seems best to me. My advisor is aware I have struggles in mental health, but not the severity my mental health status. I do feel we have a good relationship. In fact, she was the reason I started my PhD program - I worked with her two years prior to becoming her official graduate mentee (I've known her for 5 years now). My hope is she will be understanding, but I am prepared for anything. I do always finish my work for her and I have worked/accomplished various tasks in our lab. In fact, she is the reason, this has taken so long, I respect her in ways I cannot express. However, I also cannot express what it is like to go home and simply feel empty and dead inside... For 2 years now. I've tried, believe me, I've tried to work through this (Medication, social support, therapy, ""working through it"") - But I need to accept that it is my time to leave. I love the thought of academia, not the actual participation in it, unfortunately.

I can't help but feel this conversation will be coming out of left field for her. How do I set up this meeting? I know it must start with an email, but how clear should I be in this email about what the conversation is about? To be quite honest, I don't know if I can have a face-to-face conversation without crying (I cry a lot in my current state). I am prepared for a slow transition out, I have accepted the inevitability of finishing up my semester, as much as I cannot bear the thought. I want to prepare her to hand off tasks. I am prepared to take a ""leave of absence"" if it is offered, but I cannot make any promises that I ever want to return to academia. I also have a lot of connections here on campus that I need to inform, but feel the intense desire to tell my advisor first. 

Also, I do *not* plan on telling my advisor about my suicidal ideations - I have read that this only leads to a messy situation. However, I want to make it clear that my mental health is at stake.

I have been slow to learn techniques because I'm not in the lab much - I did research for 3 years during my undergrad and completed a MSc, so I'm not incompitent, just unfamiliar wth this lab. I haven't had a chance really to bond with my peers because normal social events have been cancelled and we can't meet up for a pint after hours.

Or they sit on their phone and ignore me but will chat with each other when someone else walks in. 

This week, they've started giving me the silent treatment. They don't engage with me unless I directly speak to them.

(Now, of course, you’re lucky if you *can get* a waiter’s job, but that’s another story.)  Then quite suddenly everyone was saying the exact opposite.  At the tail end of the decade, every single person I met who had a Ph.D urged me to go to grad school, insisting that there’s going to be a huge glut of jobs in academia.  Sure enough, in 1989, at the orientation of my doctoral program at my distinguished university, the chair of the history department got up and made the following declaration:  “Normally I have the awkward task at these orientations of lauding all that our department readily provides to its students, but then offering a sober assessment of the dismal job prospects that will follow.  But *this* year, for the first time since I’ve become chair, I can safely say that, *barring a major depression*, there will a job waiting for you when you graduate.  Here at our university, nearly half of our faculty in the history department, who had been hired to teach the baby boomers, will be retiring over the next decade, and we plan to replace every retiree with two new faculty members.”  

Well, I don’t remember any major depression in the 1990s, but I certainly noticed that none of those jobs materialized.

How much do *they* benefit economically from the denial of a living wage and benefits to their academic colleagues?  How much do *they* assuage their consciences by pretending that they still function in a merit system in which the best and the brightest get their just rewards?

However, I just couldn’t bring myself to think or write anything. I know that I knew the material, but I just stared at my paper for an hour before deciding to just hand it in almost blank. I thought that since I already wasted an hour doing nothing, there’s no way I’ll finish it on time so I might as well use my remainder time to get my shit together for my 2nd exam. 
I told the proctor that I will be back at 12 PM for my 2nd exam, but I never went back. I was just sitting at an empty classroom right across the exam room crying and stayed there for 5 hrs. I wanted to write that exam so bad and pass my exams, but I just couldn’t bring myself to do so. I don’t know how to explain it. I was hoping that I will be able to somehow bring myself back to write the exam. I am so frustrated with myself because I know that this is not a valid excuse and I just need to get over it.


My Accessibility Advisor (advisors for students with learning disabilities - I have a learning disability not related to depression.. Its Vision Related) advised me to apply for a back-dated Medical withdrawl (something I’ve never heard of before). However, when I was talking to the Faculty Advisor she said that she can’t really give me an advice since the only thing that I can do is write a petition letter to the dean. I was told that these are only granted under excruciating circumstances.The Advisors or Profs has no say or any power into this. After writing the letter, it’s all up to the Dean. However, I don’t even know what to write in my petition letter, because I know that I sound so petty and just using ‘Mental Illness’ as an excuse. I don’t think my reason is on the Excruciating-Level of me dying of Cancer or watching a loved-one get brutally murder right in front of me before my exam. 


Because of me failing these 2 courses, I am not sure if I can continue on with my studies. I just sabotage my future again and I am not sure what I should do next. 

How do I explain this to the Dean? Should I also include on my letter that I may have an undiagnosed Dyslexia and that I’ve just been recently referred by the government Health services for Dyslexia assessment? (It costs a lot to get these assessment done where I live and you can only get free assessment done if someone from the University referred you to get tested… then someone from the ‘government’ will interview you to determine if you qualify for a free assessment before you can get the assessment done.

I had posted a while back on this sub about being fired as a TA after multiple delinquencies. I am working as an RA right now, and I have gotten funding from my advisor for 2 years, which is a dead end I don’t think about much. Nevertheless, I am funded, and that’s that.  I am through with my coursework(almost) after 2 years.

I have pestered them with excuses of depression and diagnosed OCD/anxiety, I mean I do face these issues but..how long can a department deal with a person who had severe incompetency issues. It worried them all, the risk of putting young undergrads under my guidance. The department has never faced this extent of exhaustion with a student, understandably. My amount of sloppiness as a 1st year grad TA was insane to say the least, too many mess-ups and failures. I would not go down that downward spiral for now, I have upset three professors and that includes the Head of the department. What is left is professors from my own sub-field and my advisor. Fortunately, they were not directly made aware of these things but of course, professors talk and they are definitely aware in some form. Besides, I did not perform too well in a class taught by one of them.  

I have two years to do some solid research and work my butt off and firstly, impress my advisor who is an absolute angel. I am just curious what else can I do so that the extremely dark past of my life does not affect my future from here on.

So I got into my top grad school of choice for higher education student affairs and landed my dream assistantship at an amazing institution with many thanks from you all and others at [g/gradadmissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/) &amp; [r/resumes](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes)! 

Unfortunately... about a week ago I found out that I got dropped from spring classes because my university didn't have my final transcripts. Upon trying to reorder them from my undergrad, I learned that I owed $1,600 to my undergrad and that they won't mail them out until the account is settled. 

I'm a first generation college student from a low SES background so my family can't help me. I make shit money at my assistantship so I can't afford to pay it off before classes start next Monday.  


In order for me to keep my assistantship, I have to be enrolled in classes. I am terrified to talk to my family, my academic advisor, my students, and my boss. 

I've worked so hard to be here. My entire life has been based on the fact that I wouldn't be another statistic stuck in the poverty cycle. I grew up being told I was smart and talented enough to actually achieve the American dream and up until now, it's been true. Yet, in less than a week, my entire life might go to shit. I've never felt such a large sense of failure, shame, and depression. 

I've been in hardcore denial so I'm using this as a platform to finally admit it, but is there anyway that this will turn out alright? Or anything I can do? 

**TL;DR:** After working hard my entire life, my low SES will be the reason I get kicked out of grad school :(

**Update:** Thanks for all your amazing advice! It truly means a lot! My advisor is out of the country until Monday. I am going to the bank in a few minutes to try to apply for a personal loan. Hopefully that'll work out though, though I'm sure the process will take longer than a day? ",AskAcademia,SOS: I might be kicked out of grad school before classes start (x-post r/gradschool)

Going into my senior year of undergrad I had a 4.0 GPA, I had plenty of professors who were willing to write me recommendation letters, things seemed to be going great. But then my depression started getting out of control, things with my living situation deteriorated, I stopped going to my classes, I was hospitalized for suicidal ideation, and after getting out I moved back in with my family. I never withdrew from my classes that last semester, so I now have 5 F's on my transcript. The next couple semesters I tried going back but wasn't really ready and ended up withdrawing.

That was a few years ago. Since then I've just been working, a part-time retail job and a part-time tutoring job at a local community college. I'm doing much better now, my depression is pretty well managed with a combination of medication and regular therapy. Now I want to return to school. I have to petition a board of faculty members for reinstatement but, assuming I get back in and finish my degree (I only need 14 credits), what are my options afterward? Should I even consider grad school at this point? My GPA is shot, my transcript has two semesters of withdrawals on it, and while my old professors may well remember me, it's been a few years so I doubt they would be as eager to give stellar recommendations, especially given that I've accomplished nothing academically over the past three years.

If not grad school, then what should I do? I have a lot of coding experience but I don't know how well I'd be able to compete with people who have comp sci degrees. I don't think I would really enjoy programming as a career, but I don't really have any other marketable skills.

About my background in math, these are the courses I've taken beyond the standard calc and linear algebra sequence: Advanced Calculus I and II, Number Theory, Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometries, Intro to Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Combinatorics, and Intro to Mathematical Logic. If I am able to go back next year, I will likely take Topology, Numerical Analysis, Complex Variables, and a second semester in algebra to finish up my bachelor's.

askacadem-throwaway,,2017-05-09 06:26:27,6a3rat,33,"Hi,

This is a somewhat personal and self indulgent post, for which I apologize in advance. I'm a first year PhD student. I've been struggling with mental illness since my very early teens, almost as long as I've wanted to go into academia. I'm in a great program and my career is on track, but I still feel like I'm treading water every day, barely able to stay afloat, and worried that it will inevitably become impossible. 

Academia and stress aren't the problem. I'd be depressed even with no external stressors. I've tried countless meds and years of therapy. At this point I've accepted that, barring a miracle cure, my life is likely to continue to be moderate depression punctuated by episodes of major depression. I take my meds and go to therapy and try to be as proactive about it as possible. My program and my research bring me some joy in addition to the stress, and I can't see myself doing anything else. 

That being said, the only discussions I see of mental health in academia are either someone who experienced an episode of depression, got treatment, and got better, or someone who left academia because it was worsening their depression. Very rarely there's a story of someone who chronically struggles with episodes of depression but is otherwise happy between episodes. 

Is there anyone out there who's made it in academia who struggles with mental health issues on a daily basis and always has? Or do people like me eventually inevitably burn out and/or not make it?

I don't know if it's just something that people don't talk about, or if it's impossible to make it in academia with these struggles, and it's not something I can really just start asking around about. ",AskAcademia,Chronic mental illness in academia

She's plenty smart and her grades are not terrible, and I do believe her interest in education is sincere, but she also has social anxiety issues and occasional bouts with depression that have interfered with her academics.

Has anyone made it through dealing with the Title IX office with a PhD and without having some sort of breakdown? Based on my experiences, and those that have been shared with me, it seems more like a place we direct people we want to systematically ignore, and they made my situation significantly worse in multiple ways. If anyone has advice for support I might not have considered seeking, I would appreciate it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't been able to see a way forward in my program since long before I was terminated in the midst of trying to file a formal title 9 complaint. The general lack of resolution and accountability since I was ""unterminated"" (except without funding for reasons no one will even give me) is hard to stomach and does terrible things to my motivation. This was never about money, earning some sort of gold star, or even a PhD for me. I just wanted to be where my nerd powers would best serve humanity, and it's painful that I cannot seem to get a straight answer about things that have made my working environment incredibly depressing and degrading.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't know how I managed to not kill myself, and if I didn't have a bunch of evidence to ungaslight myself, accomplishments, and amazing friends -- I am pretty sure I would have. Like, if my cat had died during that time: it definitely would have been game over. The system seems so broken and counter-productive, I no longer feel like this is an efficient avenue at all, and I can't help but wonder when a promising student commits suicide seemingly out of nowhere -- if they may have been going through something like I did. If people who act like the guy who bullied and slandered me can just waltz through a PhD, and people who try to confront this kind of triangulation are made to feel as unwelcome in academia as I do right now: I am actually afraid of what I have to look forward to. Being treated like some sort of hysteric for having this concern has basically just left me stuck in some sort of existential crisis, trying to figure out if humanity is even worth working to preserve if we are going to keep giving leadership positions to people who only seem to care about themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not quite ready to share my story, and I need to figure out how to pare down 14 pages and hundreds of screenshots, but I feel like I should, no matter how this plays out. I would like to be able to finish my PhD, but I can't keep sacrificing my mental health for people who share threads about dealing with toxic behavior on twitter, after actively making a toxic situation unbearable and refusing to engage about it. In retrospect, since I still can't get any examples of the behavior I was accused of by my former coworker to get this written off as an interpersonal issue, it kind of seems like my biggest mistake was trusting people who I needed to be able to trust. If my career is going to be derailed by this: I might as well try to bring attention to it. I would choose public humiliation and understanding how to avoid this in the future, over letting this go and pretending like it's OK, hands down. I have talked to so many people who have stayed quiet, because they are traumatized, ashamed, need reference letters, fought too hard to sacrifice their career, stigma, and so many other reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be shocked to hear big-name professors who went down for harassment had been making dozens of people miserable for decades, but now it seems obvious how actively we are enabling them. Former mentors and colleagues I went to for advice said things like ""he'll get a reputation, but you don't want to be the one to start it,"" and encouraged me to just power through. I'm not convinced the rumor mill is going to save anyone from people who have made their way through life by manipulating it when we silence victims in so many ways.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it like this everywhere? Is everyone in academia just too busy to care? Am I fighting to just prolong this nightmare, so I can watch this happen to other people and not be able to do anything?

&amp;#x200B;

If your first instinct is that I am just a weak, whiny person: you may be part of a systemic problem everyone loves to ignore. Feel free to test your doubts, I would love to be wrong, and I'm completely dead inside anyway, so I might as well obliterate my last shred of faith in academia (I have been trying to deal with this since 2013). 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any advice that could help me finish my PhD under these circumstances, pay for another semester, and/or share my story in a way that highlights the systemic problem that has gotta be way worse for people with less privilege without sounding like some entitled white woman: I would really appreciate it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tl:Dr:  I just wanted to study mold genetics until I died surrounded by fellow weirdos, but someone who didn't seem to care about mold or science joined the lab and started manipulating me and other people at my expense. The more I tried to rise above, give the benefit of the doubt, ask for help, or get people to confront the disturbing behavior pattern I was struggling to deal with: the worse it got. If my life is going to be derailed like this, I might as well share my story. People who know my former advisor and current dept head are going to be shocked by some of their emails and actions, but hopefully they can embrace some of that cognitive dissonance and consider the possibility this happens everywhere. I am trying to stay in academia, so I can look out for the next generation, but it kind of seems like I will just have to watch in horror if nobody cares or has any idea how to deal with this.

While I like biology theory I hated the lab, so I decided to do another degree in computer science in which I found my calling. Particularly around business analysis and database systems and other data science subjects.

Once I finished my degree I was coerced into doing a PhD in bioinformatics by my honors supervisor.

Turns out I got accepted into the PhD program (along with 2 other Job offers) and decided to go down the PhD route simply cause of maybe one day returning to the university and becoming a Lecturer (I love teaching, another passion of mine).

The PhD was a very difficult experience for me as I never had true passion for it, but once it was over I was relived. Because I actually did a decent job with my thesis and got 4 publications out, my supervisor offered me a bioinformatics postdoc position which I agreed to give a try, purely because I thought I would get some good teaching experience.

I am now 1.5 years into the postdoc and hating it. It really isn't what I want to do in my life, i have no (and never had) any intention of tenure track and running my own lab. I have little passion for the work I do, all I have are a good set of skills, that I can apply, but I cant translate that to writing papers cause it is another thing I hate. Publishing.

So I have this Professor, who always without fail, shows up to ""give a lecture"". But all he does is humiliate and belittle students.  I am talking about things like making you stand for the whole lecture. March around the auditorium. Writing on sheets of paper and having us hold labels for the whole lecture. Written on the papers will be statements like ""I am stupid"". He also says things like ""you should hang yourself"", if one of us doesn't answer correctly. He isn't your typically angry person. That is the worst part. He does all this methodically. Like some sadist.  

Right now, after seeing the schedule, I'm just anxious at the prospect of his lecture. Even if its a few weeks later.  

If I think rationally, I know that the worst he can do is fail me, or kill me or something along those lines. But that will never happen at the lecture. But why am I worried then? All I have to do is endure his abuse for 1 hour at a time. Then its done and dusted.  

And still I worry.

I have been battling severe depression for the last 15 months and only now the fog is kind of lifting. I was towards the end of my PhD when my depression struck and as I was hospitalized for about 8 months I had to take an extended leave of absence. My professor was nice enough to allow me to finish when I got better but the project unfortunately was in a very competitive field and my results have already been published by a competing lab. So I have been suggested to write up my thesis without any publications as that is accepted here for a getting a degree. I have a lot of laboratory experience and also have been the elected representative of my graduate school and have been the head of an organizing committee which has successfully organized international symposiums for 3 years with prestigious speakers from around the world including Noble Laureates.
My depression was the result of certain repressed memories from my childhood (sexual abuse by my older sibling and cousin) making an unwelcome appearance in the conscious part of my brain. I went through intensive trauma therapy and had to work very hard to get back to my 'normal' life.
Now that I am trying to pick up the pieces of my life I find myself in a ridiculous position where suddenly my career does not seem as bright, my once wide social circle has shrunk down to a core few and everyone is busy accomplishing things while I am stuck in one place.
I feel like I am done with being in the lab 24/7. the past 15 months have obviously changed me as a person and my research which was a very big part of my life is no longer something I identify with. I no longer see myself doing a postdoc and working in academia and discovering brilliant things in my field. It was a very hard decision but I realized that I don't want to spend the next 10 years in a lab. Having said that I still love science and cannot imagine leaving the field altogether. I have an excellent bachelors degree and two masters degrees and lot of experience in labs around Europe.
The things that still make me happy are editing my colleagues/students written works as well as promoting the exchange of ideas between scientists or students not just within my discipline but across the varied fields of science.

TL;DR: Should I tell my generally-supportive academic advisor that my complete lack of productivity is due to depression? What have you (grad students) experienced in this situation?

Before July, I hadn't had a depressive episode since 2007. I'd convinced myself it would never happen again (haha).  I woke up one morning in July and spent the day in bed thinking suicidal thoughts. Guess I was wrong.

Since then, I have been physically-present but mentally-absent at work. I have maybe a week's worth of work to show for the past two months.
Today I woke up and cried all morning. Crying jags - and my lack of concentration at work - are new symptoms I haven't experienced in the past depressive episodes.  Previously, I was able to channel my feelings into academics.

This has stalled my PhD for months, but (stupidly) I've been trying to hide it. I can't even manage that anymore if I'm crying in lab.

So I'm looking for advice: Do I tell my PI? He has always been supportive and my position is contractually guaranteed. But I worry that I might be labeled as unreliable or that it might influence his recommendation letters down the road (whether consciously or not). What have you done in this situation and how has it worked out for you?

Thanks.

**EDIT: Thank you for all your feedback.**  After weighing what was said, I am planning to tell my PI.  Regarding specific worst-case concerns: I am already in therapy in my school health center and have a psychiatric consult for medication in the pipeline, so there is a paper trail and proof of a diagnosed illness if my advisor goes Mr. Hyde on me (I don't think he will).  It also allows me to demonstrate to him that I am being proactive about the situation and trying to get back on track.  He has been amazing for the past 5 years (and I've seen the fallout of friends' abusive advisors for comparison); I don't think he will let me down.

**EDIT REDUX:**  Everything went well in the short term.  PI was supportive and expressed willingness to help me get my project back on track.

Ever since I was in undergrad I thought I've wanted to be a research scientist. So I completed undergrad, did honours (I'm Australian) and went straight into my PhD. Now I'm finding I don't want to do research at all because job prospects are terrible and I've absolutely lost my passion. I want to finish the degree because I've come this far, but after I finish I don't want to continue on with a postdoc. My problem is that outside of this, I've had no work experience. I've struggled with severe depression and anxiety my whole life so couldn't handle a job and school/university at the same time, so forewent the job on both occasions. And even when focusing entirely on school, I still didn't do very well. My undergrad GPA is only 2.5. I'm really panicking about what I'm going to do when I finish. Ideally I'd work in administration or do routine pathology/histology in a hospital, but from what I've read I'll be overqualified but also have no actual experience, so will be doubly undesirable. I want to get a job that I can do for a couple of years while I sort myself out, but I feel like I'll end up a checkout chick or flipping burgers at Maccas, and even then I'm overqualified/under-experienced and they may as well pay a 15 year old to do the same thing. Am I a lost cause? Is finishing my PhD going to hurt me in the long run? Does anyone have any suggestions to jobs I could do? Thank you all so much for reading to the end. I appreciate it.

Eventhorizon28,,2013-05-13 23:09:18,1e9ze5,25,"I am a PhD student in a very intimate, highly competitive humanities program. In the last few years, with the closing of many tenure track positions around the country and decreased funding immediately available to my program, my colleagues have become understandably very stressed, some very mentally ill (2 nervous breakdowns, depression, panic disorders, etc). The faculty turns a blind eye and I understand that for many, this is just a part of grad school and the ""experience."" However, we have a small handful of particularly toxic grad students for whom nothing is ever good enough and virulent gossip ensues where they tear each other and their accomplishments apart. As a result, the health of the department has declined even further and three students have decided to leave. The faculty has told us to not socialize with those leaving. 

I understand that, for the remainder of our lives in academia, this kind of lawlessness, gossip, and back-stabbing will always (unfortunately) be present to some degree. I'm a young, married student and I have mostly decided to stay out of departmental drama. I still attend all departmental events, readings, and colleague's birthdays/exam celebrations as a part of my professionalization. But, I do not gossip (woman in predom female dept) and, as a result, have been cut out by the ""mean girl"" crowd (best way to put it) because I refuse to talk destructively about others. I've had many mentors tell me to simply focus on my marriage and my research/teaching. I've never discussed specifics even with my former mentors. (hate the idea of airing out a dept's dirty laundry to others)

Question: In a world where you can forge life long reputations and relationships, how important is it to become close with all of your graduate student colleagues? (Considering that the ""mean girl"" crowd doesn't consist of the most driven students) How do you better protect yourself from idle academic gossip (besides working hard, being accountable and responsible, and damn it, compassionate)?

DepressedAcademia,,2018-06-12 01:49:22,8qf2uu,25,"I've suffered from severe depression over half my life and I've been receiving treatment (medication and therapy) for a little over 10 years. I've struggled with different medication combinations and the best I can hope for is to essentially feel flat. If I try to wean off meds or decrease the dose, I end up in the hospital. I haven't told many people about this, even family, because I feel it's too personal. In the past I had to take a 2 month leave for health reasons during grad school and very few people know the real reasons for this. I also had to take an emergency two week leave during my postdoc once, again no one knows the real reasons outside of my medical team and one close friend.

Despite this I've been very productive through grad school and my postdocs. I have some high quality publications, record of funding, and there is a sense from multiple people in my department and at conferences that I'm a quality applicant. But as I'm applying for both academia and industry positions, I feel like I'm at a significant disadvantage because I'm incapable of expressing any real emotion. I can smile and say I love to do certain things (which is true), but my eyes are like I'm dead inside and my voice is false, no matter how much I try to ""act"" and force it. The number one feedback I'm coming up with in the practice talks is this lack of emotion, or that I come across as fake and need to be more genuine, except ""genuine me"" has the emotional expression of a robot. I tried to scale back my meds under doctor supervision to reduce the flat emotion side effects and that almost put me in the hospital. Therapy isn't doing anything to improve. I'm starting to feel like I'm unemployable and for good reason, because no one wants to hire a person who seems constantly dead inside or like a fake.

I don't know what other options I have for a career if I can't interview well for any position, faculty or industry. I'm thinking of just staying with industry because it's less competitive and if I have so much problems interviewing because of the medication side effects it seems impossible to get an academic position, but I don't know that I'd realistically be able to get *any* position anywhere at this point.

TerlyAnderson,,2018-02-19 00:46:18,7yismj,24,"Hi all,


I'm really stressed out right now because I'm in my first year of a PhD program where the stipend is simply not meeting the cost of living in my expensive, tech-booming west coast city. What's extra stressful is that this is my second time trying out a PhD program at this university. The first time, I was feeling anxious, isolated, and unhappy so I left after I had my MS. After a year of doing other research out of school, I realized that I was still very passionate about science, and decided to give it another go. I know a lot of people believe in me, and my academic progress is going very well- in fact, I'm on track to graduate in 3 years. But I'm struggling so much with my wellness and the discomfort of not quite making it in my city. I’m getting more and more depressed and sleepless (I am seeing my campus’ psychiatrist about this). 


I live relatively frugally- I have 6 housemates and my car is 12 years old. Because rent is so high where I live, though, I’m out several hundred dollars each month. Going into my program, I anticipated being able to make it because other students were. But I’m realizing that many of my classmates are actually supported by a partner or their parents (although, there is generally a lot of depression and discomfort in the cohort for other reasons). My stress is not just because I’m working way overtime trying to do enough outside work to make up the difference, but also because I don’t feel totally right with this morally. I understand that graduate school is low-income for everyone, and it never bothered me in my previous graduate program when I had a bit of a margin every month. But I also know that my work as a researcher and a course instructor is beneficial to my lab, my department, and the university, and for me to do this as a full-time job, I believe I should be paid at least enough to live healthily. Then again, I know that not every grad student is in the same situation- people in humanities make even less than I do as a STEM student.


I’ve been very vocal with my department and advisors about this and they all say the department simply has no extra funds. I am already on a federal grant which they cannot supplement very much. My advisers aren’t rude, but don’t seem to be taking this extremely seriously, because they all remember being poor in grad school. I have looked at even cheaper housing, but I’m just not that comfortable with it- I can go a bit cheaper, but it means moving into places that are considerably more rundown or make my commute ~2 hours per day. I can also keep doing outside work, but I’m getting really burned out doing this. 


Here’s what I feel badly about:


1)	I can probably finish my degree in another 2 years, so maybe I should stick it out so I can just have the title and move on. The research is going well enough. But I feel gross about this situation.


2)	Other people make do on very, very little and survive this, so what does it say about me if I can’t? I could make even further sacrifices- move into an even more basic living situation, switch to using a food bank for my groceries, and keep doing supplemental work even if it’s difficult. I could take out a loan. If I’m not willing to make those additional sacrifices, does it mean I wasn’t really committed to this PhD?


3)	Since this is my second go-around trying a PhD program at my university, I’m worried that because my university took another chance on me after I left one program, I owe it to them to complete this. Especially because other people find ways to make it work. 


**TL;DR:** I know grad students are supposed to be poor, but I don’t feel right about the fact that I’m making less than it costs to live in my city and having to make sacrifices that affect my health, wellbeing, and comfort. I’m seeking some perspectives and stories about this issue.

wayward_wander,t2_101wr6,2016-08-02 14:38:40,4vsqv2,23,"Here's what I'd like to know:

* Should I leave academia?
* If I leave academia, what are my options? 
* Who hires people with PhD's in pure mathematics?
* What kind of additional education should I seek out? 

Some additional questions: 

* Could I, for example, get a masters in engineering in one year?
* What about transitioning to applied math or applied physics disciplines? 
* Is switching fields within mathematics (to dynamics or something else less abstract than what I'm doing now) possible? If so, how do I do that?  

The list below is long and may sound overly dramatic and hysterical in places, I know, but it will take me hours to get anything down that's not just stream of consciousness. Please ignore my emotional state if you can. I am looking for actionable career advice. 

Here's my situation: 

* Got my PhD in 2010 and have been in postdocs ever since. I have only published 2 papers. The research program I set up for myself has started to falter. I stepped back from participating in the (math) community to dedicate more time to it, but haven't gotten anywhere. 
* I know that I procrastinate/don't work/am afraid to work because I'm afraid that the more I work, the faster all of my research will break down. Knowing this hasn't made it any easier to not do it.
* I rarely write to people (my old advisor, other professors who I've collaborated with, even current coauthors) with research questions, but when I do, they never write back. 
* I have felt intrinsically incapable of contributing to society, probably since I was an undergraduate. I truly do not believe anything I think or do could have any value at all, just by virtue of it coming from me. I fundamentally can not believe that anything I think of is correct. It makes doing research in mathematics absolutely impossible. 
* If I'm being honest, I never believed I'd be able to succeed in academia, even though my goals were modest. I felt like I had to keep trying just in case thinking I couldn't do it was the only thing holding me back. My (very long term) SO is not helpful. His position is essentially that having these problems at all, and having had them for so long without being able to fix them, is reason enough to quit academia. I've never quit anything that has been meaningful to me. I don't know how to do it. 
* I have no marketable skills at all. (My degree is in pure math. I don't even know how to program.)
* A permanent lectureship at my current institution might be possible, but I'm not really interested in just teaching. I want to be able to produce things. If not academic research, then something else. I've spent a little time looking at options and found some things interesting, but I don't know how to get into them. 
* I'm sure I can learn things like programming, statistics, or data analytics, but there are so many other people doing that, I won't be competitive as a washed up mid-30's mathematician with uncontrollable depression. How am I supposed to believe I will be considered for jobs where I'll be up against 17 year olds who have been programming since they were 8? I know financial jobs like quants are open to mathematicians, but I'm pretty sure the skills they are looking for are the skills that are preventing me from staying in academia.

I've been placed on medical leave of absence from my PhD studies. My symptoms were total burn-out and severe depression (now responding well to meds). Without giving out too much info, the reason for my depression was that a massive, and I mean massive, scientific misconduct investigation went on in my institution = the working environment was a complete pile of shit. I was just lucky not to have my name on any involved articles, but my research group has basically fallen apart and I have no possibilities of going back.

But - since I had a contract and funding for four years, and the university has concluded that I do not have any fault in what went down, they are offering to give me a new project in another lab. I don't know really what to do with this. 

A part of me has just really lost confidence in research as a whole. Why should I keep working my ass off when people above and around me fake data?

fmacademicl,t2_v04yx,2016-02-15 04:11:41,45uqjx,22,"Throwaway, obvs. I curse a lot, sorry.

Currently PhD 5. I submitted my dissertation last week. I defend in April; I graduate in June. It's as good as a done deal. I completed exactly on schedule. I did all the shit exactly as it's supposed to be done. I have academic accolades aplenty, a publication, a bunch of teaching experience, enthusiastic references, money in the bank, etc etc. 

Submitting the dissertation felt like nothing. There was no jubilation. I can't seem to allow myself to celebrate this as an achievement in any way.

I chose not to go on the academic job market, because I'm tired. I've been in university without a significant break since 2005 and I'm just fucking exhausted. I am completely disillusioned with my discipline, and just not interested in it the way I once was. I regret doing my PhD in what I did it in (a crusty humanities field). I'm a young ""rad"" queer theory type in an old white dude discipline that by and large thinks queer theory is a load of narcissistic bullshit, or so comfortably marginal they don't have to deal with ""that kind of thing"". It used to feel edgy. Now I'm just. fucking. tired.

The biggest reason, though, is that I have no desire to move to some shitass tiny college town in Fucksville, USA. I'm not from the US, I didn't do my degree in the US, I don't particularly want to live there at all. And now having seen the jobs that came up this application season, I don't think I would have wanted any of them anyway. I realize I should have thought about this before I started. But, you know, you couldn't have persuaded me otherwise, because school was always the thing I was best at in the world, and got the most enjoyment out of. I was that little nerdy undergrad who hung out in the journal aisle of the library for fun. And it's a bit late now for regrets.

So I'm staying in the big city. I should be ecstatic probably. It's a good city. But I am crushingly, crushingly depressed. There is no solid plan B; most of the stuff that's touted as plan Bs for academic dropouts just doesn't hold any interest for me. I have no desire to launch myself on some other high-flying career path or climb the corporate ladder or start my own business or whatever. Honestly, I think I just want to get a mindless job for a while and spend some time becoming a person again, but I have no idea if a fucking PhD could even get a mindless job in the first place.

My twenties are as good as gone (I'm 28). My peers mostly figured this shit out when they left school the first time around, at all of 21. Sure I got to indulge my shit for a few years, but I didn't even *enjoy* it most of the time. The first two years were okay (or at least so busy I didn't have time to think about whether I was enjoying myself), but things precipitously dropped after that. It's no heartrending lifechanging intense pursuit of passion, just a lot of frustration, and I must have spent like three-quarters of it depressed to varying degrees, at times clinically, at times on medication, often drinking heavily. I've managed to curb the drinking for the past few months, but there's always the danger of it creeping back.

I am good at the academic shit. It makes sense to me. I know how to write the things academics like to read and appease them in the right ways. I am still completely unconvinced my dissertation has any merit whatsoever, although my committee all said I should be proud. I cut a lot of corners. I nonetheless somehow managed to fool the gatekeepers. Impostor syndrome? hell yes it is, since day one.

I don't really have hope for the future right now. I've reached the end of this tether. I don't feel like I'm really good at anything else; I sure as hell don't have people skills, and I'm not even from the country I'll be trying to get employed in.

I am working on getting the therapy I obviously desperately need (such a horrendously protracted process, fixing your head, all of it), but I was wondering whether anyone had any insight. This is an incredibly distressing time (aided and abetted by the fact I was unexpectedly dumped a couple weeks before I submitted, which I have had, and am having, an enormous struggle with). I always felt isolated, but I feel extra super isolated now, and precarious, and frankly terrified as shit. I feel like I've fucked up something wicked at some point in this process &amp; I'm not really sure how to bring any enjoyment whatsoever back into my life.

rebbieh,t2_70jbj,2015-04-22 16:32:11,33ho2l,20,"Hello,

I'm in my 4th semester at university where I study biomedicine. I'm *very* interested in science and medicine and there's nothing else I'd rather study (well, sometimes I think I would've liked going to medical school to become a doctor but that's not going to happen) but things have gotten really bad lately. I've lost *all* motivation even though I really like what I study and my grades have gotten worse (simply because I've lost motivation). Last year they were pretty great and now they're average at best. I am yet to fail an exam but the grades I get on exams etc. are lower than they were before, which makes me very disappointed in myself.

I suspect the reason I no longer have the will to do anything comes down to two things:

1. *The fact that I no longer have a specific goal to work towards*. I used to be really sure about what I wanted to do. I used to know exactly what I wanted to study when I'm done with the bachelor's degree and I knew I eventually wanted to go into medical research. I still think that's what I want but I'm not sure in what area and if it's even possible for me to work with the things that really interest me. I've been trying to ask professors and other people about it but no one really has any good answers to my questions.

2. *Psychiatric/neuropsychiatric problems*. I have Asperger's syndrome, which makes certain things really problematic for me. Especially things like oral presentations, stress (I have pretty much zero stress tolerance), perfectionism, anxiety, depression etc. I'm trying to work on it (autism isn't something that'll go away but I'm trying to come up with good coping strategies etc.) but it's difficult. I'm a very stubborn and determined person who loves learning things so I don't really give up but it's difficult for me to adapt to higher levels of pressure/stress, which means things are more difficult now than last year. I know it's hard for others too but most people still seem to have some kind of innate ability to adapt that I don't really possess.

I think the most important thing for me and my academic future is to find the motivation again. It would also be really helpful to figure out what I want to do with my life but that's a huge question and I don't really know where to start.

Most people don't have autism/Asperger's *but* I know it's very common for students to lose motivation at times, which means some/most of you probably have too at some point. So, I'm wondering if any of you have any advice on what to do...? How do I get motivated again? How'd you do it? Also, how do I figure out what I want to do in the future? So far there are basically two areas I'm interested in (the area between neuroscience and psychology, and medical microbiology) but I don't even know what one can do in those areas.

Anyway, thanks for reading.

shouldidoaphd,,2017-10-08 12:05:05,751bia,19,"Hello all. I’m going to start applying for grad school soon I’m a bit concerned about the actual reason I’m getting a PhD for. I’ve realised that I’m not going for it because I’m extremely passionate about my subject but because I don’t want to lead the so-called ‘normal’ lives that my friends and family are living. I want to use it as an escape to stay out of the ‘real-world’ for as long as possible.

The rat-race disgusts me. A lot of my childhood friends have just got corporate jobs and it saddens me to see them brag about their salaries and cool new offices like little kids. All of them and my family think that I’m an idiot for not trying to get a corporate job when I have so much potential. They think anyone who isn’t constantly trying to maximise the amount of money they make is an idiot and that really pisses me off. My father works in a pretty big company and he’s probably the most miserable person I’ve ever met in my life. I’d like to be rich too but not just for the heck of it, but by achieving something truly significant and that I can be proud of.

I’ve also been suffering from depression for the past few years and I’ve realised that when I’m in the library in my university working on a problem, I forget all about it. Even if I don’t enjoy it that much, using all of my mental faculties to focus on solving something makes me rise above the bullshit that surrounds me and makes me feel less alienated. This probably is because I’m an introvert who has cut out most of his friends and family from his life. When I’m working on a problem, keeping myself busy, nothing else concerns me. Which is why I think I can do this for the rest of my life.

The dept is currently headed by a couple of semi-retired full profs. The acting chair is not a scholar, has never pursued research and publishing, but instead has built their career being an autocratic 'strong man' for administrators, appointed to chair departments whenever a dean wanted to create 'efficiencies' etc. (you know what that means I'm sure). The chair was appointed to our dept by the dean, then 'elected' in a process that would have outed anyone who didn't vote for them (everyone was pre-tenure at that time), and likes rewording history to ignore the reality of their installment over us. Both semi-retirees will be gone in 2 years, and in my assessment, the program is being left in a condition that might make sense to an administrator, but is, from my perspective, not reflecting the state of the art in the discipline, nor does it look sustainable to me from an administrative perspective without the combined knowledge of decades of administrative trickery that the current chair has. The problem is, as the ranking prof, I've said this and been ignored. I would be the next in line to chair the dept. but I seriously don't want anything to do with that job. The Jr. profs are pretty much towing the line for the current chair, and don't seem to realize those people aren't even going to be there when they're up for tenure. So, I'm thinking I have a few options: (1) Shut up and keep my head down, let the house of cards fall when the Emeriti finally leave, (2) get the hell out of Dodge asap, (3) seek to have my appointment moved to a different dept, (4) embrace the madness and throw myself into the fray of Dept. and College politics. The first option seems to hold the best promise for continuity in my research and writing, the second is appealing only if I can get to a better institution in as good or better an urban area (I'm a city person, which is in large part why I've stayed this long), the third might just invite all the same shit in a different pile, the fourth will undoubtedly result in an increase in my dosage of anti-depression meds.

swagever,,2017-10-16 14:23:30,76qsk4,19,"Hi there,

Not sure if this is the right kind of topic for this sub, but I thought I’d try to reach out for some help here anyway. 
This year I started my honours thesis as an undergrad. I enjoy my research topic as it’s something I’m passionate about and because of this it wasn’t a project that was handed to me on a plate by the professor I approached to supervise me. I’ve wanted to pursue research ever since I started uni and I’ve worked my ass off to get to the GPA I have today.
This year has also been the hardest year of my life and I was diagnosed with severe depression and an anxiety disorder as a result, so naturally this threw a major spanner in the works and it completely inhibited me from being able to work well. 
When I hit rock bottom, I reached out to someone within the uni who contacted my supervisors and explained the situation on my behalf, and everyone including the faculty I’m in agreed that I needed to take some time off uni to get some professional help. So I did.
I’ve been keeping up with therapy and I decided to recommence my honours project half way through this year (semester 2) and thus finish mid year next year as opposed to the end of this year.
As cliche as it sounds, the road to recovery has definitely been harder (and slower) than I expected and trying to deal with uni again has been difficult while trying to get myself back on track. 
The problem is other than awkward small talk, I’ve never really had the chance to have a serious conversation with my supervisors about my situation. When I recommenced at the beginning of this semester it was business as usual with my supervisors and I’d receive the awkward ‘how’s things?’ thrown in the mix of conversation about my thesis. I’ll also add that at the time even my friends and family didn’t know that was going on so it was impossible for me to open up to my supervisors...
Fast forward a few months to now and I’m still struggling to make significant progress (the amount I’d hope to be making - yay perfectionism) with my thesis and it’s causing some issues with my supervisors... such as them thinking I’m not putting in enough effort or that I’m prioritising other things such as work over uni when this is certainly not the case as I’m truly trying my absolute best to keep up. 

I guess what I’m trying to get at here is that I feel completely trapped between uni and my personal life and I don’t know how to reach out for help. My supervisors obviously know that I’ve been dealing with some things but their reaction to it all has been completely indifferent which has made me feel even more inferior and not good enough for them or for research. 

Im scared of being unprofessional and painting myself as an incapable student if I tell them that I’m still struggling but doing the best I can and that they just need to bare with me. 

I’m sorry that this is such a long read, but I’m hoping someone can give me some advice as to what I should do? Perhaps someone that’s gone through a similar situation or has dealt with a student that hasn’t known how to ask for help in fear of being unprofessional or seen as a burden? I know academics aren’t these untouchable beings that only care about their students results... but it sure feels like that right now.

Thank you for reading. Even if no one replies this has helped getting it off my chest.

Although I have many questions that I would like to ask, the first issue that I would like to bring up has to do with the title. Many faculty members have been with the department for decades, thus, there exists a lot of institutionalized dysfunction. 

We recently began a search for a new department chair. However, a few members of the department (the bad apples) completely scared off the first choice for the position. As far as I know, she actually cited these 3 individuals as the primary reason why she wouldn't take the position, and even went so far as to say that she would gladly take it if the college removed them.

I've struggled with sporadic bouts of depression due to the change in environment. The university that I came from was completely different in that it was professional and drama free. Here there is a lot of negativity, rumor spreading, and one of these individuals has been verbally hostile towards me recently. 

Within the department, I work for a researcher who is mostly insulated from the dysfunction. Therefore, I'm somewhat insulated as well.

Im writing in part because I needed to vent to my peers anonymously. I'm also hoping to gain some insight as far as how I should handle interactions with these individuals. Is this normal in higher ed? Is it acceptable to confront these individuals when they engage in negative behavior towards me? I tend to be a fairly confrontational person so I find it difficult to know how to handle situations with ""superiors"".

UncharacteristicAge,,2017-11-02 11:46:32,7aay05,19,"Hi everyone, 
I am completely hopeless as I write this and am in desperate need for advice. 

I'll give a little background of myself [20/F]. I am a sociology major who has/is worked/working very hard to prove to her very middle eastern parents/ that there is more to life than just choosing the medical or engineering route. 

I have gone out of my way not to only build my college applications to stand out, but also make a difference in my community in any way I can. I volunteered over 500+ community service hours JUST in high school when the minimum was 20. I started a nonprofit, helped out in countless fundraisers &amp; really put my blood, sweat and tears into getting to my dream schools, which were UC Berkeley &amp; UCLA. I was lucky enough to be admitted to both schools. 

 A prerequisite to applying for sociology was Statistics 1. Now I have to tell you, math was never my strong suit &amp; I took it 5 times. 

The first time I took it, I dropped it because of my mental health issues(severe depression &amp; anxiety). 

The second time I took it, I failed(with an F) the semester before I was applying. I froze on the final exam despite knowing the material well. The final was also going to replace another exam I had previously missed due to having a panic attack that day.

The third time I took it, I took it over a 5 week session in which I got into a car accident and had to drop it because I ended up missing a week in which I missed out on materials needed in order to pass the class. 

The fourth time I took it, which was literally a semester before I was transferring. I had no other choice, but I knew I had to pass this class no matter what. I mean, it hurt my educational ego a bit that I still wasn’t able to pass this after attempting this so many times. 

So I took the class, and according my calculations, I was supposed to end up with a C (which was also part of my conditional offer; to finish the semester with a 3.0+ and pass statistics with a C or better).   
 I did everything, got a C in the class, participated in my graduation ceremony from CC and was so relieved that I could go on and transfer to Berkeley(I chose Berkeley because it ranked #1 in sociology). However, two days after graduation, I got an email from my professor saying my friend and I plagiarized and that she was taking away points for the assignment, all my extra credit points and a grade replacement which dropped my grade to a D. 

What had happened was my friend and I turned in an identical lab because we had worked on it together on Google Docs, which wasn’t prohibited nor mentioned in the syllabus. It was not an exam or quiz, it was simply just a lab assignment, which everyone in class usually collaborated with one another and submitted. My friend and I were not told, nor did we think it was the wrong thing to do. My professor just assumed we cheated and refused to talk to us about the issue, failed to reply back to our emails to meet, and the only thing she said it was my right to contest her decision and file a grade dispute which both my friend and I did.
We have a list of witnesses who were actually present when we did the assignment to account for the fact we did not cheat, possible video recordings of us working together at the school’s tutoring lab and cafe, and even numerous professors and faculties to vouch for our academic integrity.  
We were called to the dean's office since the professor filed an academic dishonesty case against us. We told the dean what had happened and he believed us on what had happened and cleared us of any disciplinary action. However, he said there was nothing else he could to do help us. Though, he did advise me to take the class over once again. He said the professor is a very difficult person to reason with(also called her an ass) and they've had issues with her before which she was very unhelpful. He also said knowing her, she's quite adamant on not wanting to change our grade.

 He told us we could still contest her decision but did not tell us how. That was his way of indirectly trying to save his ass(according to other faculty members I've spoken to about this issue). Thus began our wild goose chase. We bounced from one place to another and hit many dead ends. No one gave us any guidance or any clear instructions for how to go about this. 

 As a result, my offer from Berkeley was rescinded and my life completely shattered into dust. 
 After weeks and weeks of running around to the president, the vice president, the dean, and countless faculty/professors, it was then made clear to us that since it happened during summer, they didn't do anything about it until 2 months after. 

I took the stats class during summer right after I was informed that has happened just in case the grade dispute didn't go in my favor, which I'm glad I did, because after weeks of waiting to hear back, I received an email stating they didn't approve of a hearing and dismissed my case without letting me even advocate for myself and explain what had happened. 

 I am a first generation student and my parents didn't believe in me until after I got into Berkeley. I worked my entire life to get to where I wanted yet because of a professor who is unwilling to let us justify what actually happened and a school's neglect, my admission got taken away from me. I have never been more disappointed in my entire life. This incident sent me into severe depression and completely derailed my life. 


Is there anything I can do to get my admission back?  Is there anything I can do in general at this point? I don't know if I can recover from this. I worked so hard and can't help but feel it was all for nothing.

I've been working on a chapter of my thesis since August with very little progress. At first I was struggling with writing block for a while; now, I have lost all interest entirely. I don't want to do any reading or writing at all. I don't even really want to do anything else on this PhD and have been thinking about quitting for a long time, except for the fact that I desperately don't want to be 'the one who quit'. I'm conscious that time is passing by and my thesis is due next October 2020 and so far I have NOTHING. 

At first when this started I was in a state of panic and crying every day. Now I feel kind of numb to it all. I am worried of course the time is going by and I'm doing nothing, but I don't care that much about it? I feel in general really unhappy, isolated, losing interest in food, have had no sex drive for months, trouble sleeping/staying asleep.

The thing is that I feel all of this would probably immediately be remedied by quitting my PhD which is why I am questioning if this is actual depression or just burn out.

throwaway5567895,t2_cujvb,2013-08-22 01:50:40,1kugpv,18,"A little background:  I'm 30, this year will be my 8th year in grad school.  During my first year they failed half my class on the screening exam (paper test on course work), which pissed off the entire department at the test writers/graders.  This set me back with research, and then my brother was killed in an accident.  I happened to inherit a small amount of money which I lost due to depression/stupid business venture/ too much generosity.  I managed to pass the screening on the second chance (you only get one second chance on that) three months after my brother died, but then I got burned out.  My family started fighting, and I made some dumb choices.  A year later I finally started research with my new adviser and I've been at it for about 4 years now. 

I've never been the best grad student.  My first project was kind of a dud and that cost me a year, but got me through my quals/candidacy exam.  I only published once on that project.

I then picked a second follow up project as part of my quals proposal, and I've been working on that one ever since, it's now been about two years and I have no data.  This project is so much harder than I could have possibly imagined.  Last year, my best friend died, and this year my grandfather died.  I'm now working insane hours and writing what I have, but I literally have ZERO data and it's been eight years of my life.  As a comparison, many of my students that I started with are still in the program, probably because of that first exam, but I'm further behind than most of them I feel.

Last night I spent a 24 hour period again attempting to acquire data, and it failed, again.  I actually expected this one to fail, but I needed to use up the remaining resources before I could redesign.  I am doing another round of building and testing over the next week.  I'm tired, frustrated and shot.

My adviser is funding me fully for the fall.  He's been funding me pretty consistently, but he got pissed at me this summer for not having a publication out.  It cost him a grant.  He got another grant, but he lost his old one in part because my work didnt publish.  I've made progress on the repeat-ability of parts of my experiment, and put it through multiple re-engineering phases to get it to work, but it's so fucking touchy that I'm afraid it's not feasible to get data from this.  I have no idea at what point I just say 'fuck it' and walk away with an MS for the work I published on.  My adviser thinks it will work, but I'm not so sure.

I dont wanna talk to him about this until I've failed at it a few more times due to his continued investment, but I really want to know, when do I just call a loser a loser and do something else?  Grad school has stolen my life.

Any advice would be nice.

ApplesROranges,t2_vqjd5,2016-02-28 00:07:51,47z5eb,17,"  Hi all, not sure if this is the right place to post, but I’m at a point in my phd where I need some advice. I’m a third year physics phd student at a top 100 physics program, and I’m ABD. Now that I’ve made it through the formalities and basics (core classes, qualifier exam, becoming literate in my field), I’m at a point where I need to focus in and decide how the remaining 3-4 years of my phd experience will be structured, what skills I want to develop, and what kind of person I want to be at the end of my phd.    
  This is a complex decision though, because I’m navigating around a variety of concerns and problems. I think my biggest fear is graduating without any employable skills. My second biggest fear is the possibility of completing my phd and having completely lost my identity, having sacrificed all of my time and energy towards the pursuit of knowledge and productivity. I want to be employable, but I still want to be a “real person” and have hobbies, interests, and passions.    
  With regards to my first concern, employability, I’m studying nanoscience: particularly projects related to spintronics, nano-optics, and magnetism. I chose this field (and advisor) because it seemed relevant to the world of next-generation electronics, an industry that is vast and will keep growing as nanofabrication methods continue to advance. Also, I have never planned on pursuing academia after graduate school, for a number of reasons. I have experience in nanofabrication, high-vacuum technology, and electronics (though electronics is my biggest weakness). I don’t have much experience coding. I know very basic Labview, matlab, and python but haven’t spent much time with them.  I’ve also struggled with imposter syndrome since I began graduate school, which is know is super common. I’ve done well enough in my courses (B+ average) but don’t feel fluent in quantum mechanics at all. I guess generally I feel like I passed the exams, but don’t necessarily have enough mastery of the subjects to teach them to someone else, which I think is the truest test of understanding. 
  My second concern is based on my life outside of the lab. I want to succeed academically, but don’t want to commit the entirety of my waking life to my work. I feel like the older graduate student in our group has become little more than a breathing research instrument, working weekends and constant late nights. He has a decent publication record and is good with hands-on work, but doesn’t have friends, hobbies, or social skills.     
  The reason this concerns me is because I’ve definitely felt my social skills diminish since I’ve joined the lab and even though I try to make time for myself outside of the lab, anxiety, depression, and fatigue have made it difficult to enjoy myself or pursue things that make me happy. I’ve set up an appointment with a therapist, and a lot of my mental health issues aren’t a result of my work life.    
  So, with all that being said, I recently went to a job recruitment talk from Intel and a striking point that they emphasized was that they were less interested in the specific things that students learned in their phd, more covetous of the general skills that a phd graduate possesses: attention to detail, being able to break problems down into their most basic parts, determination, creativity.    
  This was kind of encouraging to me, because while I have specific gaps in my education, I’m on track to have 3-5 publications by the time I graduate, 2-3 of which will be mostly my own work, so I’m definitely developing all of the soft skills that the recruiter was talking about. Furthermore, I’m not hard set on the industry of electronics and computing, and this made me feel like I’ll have more options coming out of graduate school as a result of the general skills that I’ll develop through my work as a graduate student. For one, I’m passionate about food and cooking, so food science interests me. After talking with this Intel recruiter, I feel as though my lack of background in biology and chemistry may be less of a barrier for entry into the food science industry than I originally thought.    
  **Do you have any advice for someone in my shoes? Is the only way to assure employability by committing as much time as possible to my work? Should I try to fill in all of the perceived gaps in my education? Would I more successfully broaden my job options after graduating by increasing the breadth or depth of my skillset?**    
  I’ll obviously talk with my advisor about some of these issues, but also wanted some input from other people. Thanks and sorry for the wall of text!

I am in year #3 of my PhD program with the earliest possible completion being August 2016, I am not ABD, nor all that close. I have dealt with a form of depression throughout my experience and have went to counseling to handle some of the effects. I have now gotten to the point where I no longer feel motivated or really care about the process. I recently failed to meet a major deadline, and I can't come up with any other time that has happened in my academic career. And now since that, I have lost all ability to formulate anything of value. 

I wrote on here once about how I could possibly deal with learning that I am heavily teaching-focused after I entered a research program at an R1 with a high level research load (thanks to a fellowship that was given to me without requesting it). That feeling has only grown since that post 18 months ago. I have struggled to meet research deadlines consistently, and my health/mental state has suffered in the process. 

My advisor and I have had a terrible relationship due to our polarized feelings on education. It's a dynamic that my close friends have heard countless stories about and wish I could leave to get away from for my sanity. In a meeting this summer with the department head, I was told I probably shouldn't have been a candidate for the fellowship at such a high research school. (Thanks for the confidence boost....)

My dissertation, while something I do have some level of interest in, has slowly fallen apart. I attempted to put together my proposal &amp; quickly realized I had no idea what I was doing. To put the icing on the cake, I got an email from an organization that previously told me they were interested in using my dissertation research to compile a database, that they are now basically compiling the data by themselves, with more detail than I have planned on doing. This basically means my research is possibly obsolete as of 24 hours ago. I was already in the middle of writing this before I got that email.

In the end, I am way too focused on education and my students to be in this setting. I recently went on a campus job interview at a smaller school, and while I enjoyed the experience, I can't help but say I felt out of place. I spent an hour talking about my research/dissertation experience, pretending it was the most important part of my CV, yet they only gave me 20mins to give a lecture to students.

While none of you know me, the most painful thing right now was being blasted by my peers a few weeks ago for my teaching style, including that I care too much about their problems, and how not having exams is hurting them. My peers in the program have all proposed in the past month, and are moving full speed ahead, while I have fallen behind. I probably shouldn't care, screw them blah blah blah. It still hurts. 

So a tl;dr of sorts, I am trying to decide if getting out of this toxic experience is worth exploring, while potentially moving into a job that fits my interests (i.e. advising, or as an adjunct). Thanks for any and all advice or kind words I may get out of this. We all need some guidance at times.   ",AskAcademia,Considering moving on before finishing my Ph.D.

[deleted],,2014-05-17 21:55:12,25tj08,15,"I'm sort of at a crossroads and feel at a loss as for what to do. I just finished the first year of my economics PhD program with very bad grades (2.7 GPA) due to a variety of circumstances, including lack of preparation (compared to my classmates) and depression. The way my program works, we have prelims in June, and if we fail, we can retake in August. After two failed attempts, you are on the MA track, and you spend the next year funded as a TA. I have essentially zero chance of passing prelims (even the DGS told me so), and honestly I have little interest in passing, because I've decided I'm not interested in the PhD anymore.

The thing is, there's a 3.0 GPA requirement to receive any graduate degree. I have concerns about being able to get my GPA up, especially because this last semester, I worked my butt off and still ended up with 2 B-'s. The (sort of) good news is that we can take math upper-level undergrad courses and courses in the business school (marketing, finance, etc.) for credit next year, and everyone says that grades in the math department and b school are much higher than in the econ department (all our courses so far have been very intense, very dense theory courses taught in the econ department). 

But still, it would take me getting a B+ average from here on out to even be able to graduate, and I'm concerned that getting an MA with such a low GPA could actually *hurt* my opportunities in the job market anyway, since I could just drop out right now and write off my first year as an experiment that resulted in a realization that I didn't want to be in academia (not untrue).

I know that, as an academic subreddit, perspectives on what my situation will signal in the private sector might be limited, but I couldn't really think of anywhere else to ask this. Thanks.

TL;DR: Bad grades in graduate program, will inevitably be working toward MA instead of PhD by fall. Wondering if I should drop out now so I can tell employers I spent a year in a PhD program and changed my mind, or spend the next year trying desperately to get up to a 3.0, which, since it's not a great GPA anyway, may actually hurt me in the job market.

EDIT: Just wanted to stress something I've mentioned in comments below. Passing prelims is not nearly as ""trivial"" as it is in many other programs. Typically only 1/2 to 2/3 of cohorts end up passing after both tries, and those numbers are after you take out the few people who end up leaving the program immediately after first year and not even taking the exams or getting the masters. So those numbers are slightly inflated. I know I am the lowest, or perhaps next to lowest performing student in my cohort of ~20 right now. Also, I have no interest in passing anyway. I no longer want the PhD and would just leave the program with an MA even if I passed. ",AskAcademia,"When to throw in the towel, or, consequences of a very low graduate GPA."

SesameDog,,2018-04-05 18:28:13,8a27fa,15,"I am currently a first year (2nd semester) in a Chemistry Ph.D. program. I have been struggling with severe depression and anxiety since Fall 2015, and have been medicated for it since. In the past year, my symptoms have become significantly more intense. I wonder what is the point of life, why am I doing anything, what am I even passionate about. I was struggling in being productive in the lab, though that may just be in my head (i.e. imposter's syndrome; my advisor thought I was doing ok). I have been doing perfectly fine in all of my classes. A month ago I expressed my feelings towards my advisor and told him I wanted to switch to a masters program. He seemed supportive. It was like a little bit of a weight had been lifted off my shoulders once I told him and had begun the process of switching. I have not submitted any official papers yet, so I am still a Ph.D. student. I even became interested in getting a second masters (once I finished the coursework chemistry masters) revolved around getting a teaching certification in chemistry; I've already keenly expressed my interest in that program with the head of that sub-department. Although I was a bit happier with my decision, as time passed, I realized I was just as depressed. I have been seeing a counselor for about 5 weeks, but she is honestly a bit useless and unproductive; I cancelled any future appointments with her.

The main issue here is that I was just awarded the NSF GRFP fellowship, and I am now having second thoughts on my decision of switching. Of course, the fellowship should not be a major deciding factor in my predicament, but I am starting to wonder if my decision was based on ""taking the easy way out"". I feel awful that the fellowship could have went to someone who could have used it for their Ph.D. I am most scared of regretting my decision, no matter which route I choose. There is an option of switching the focus of the Ph.D. to chemical education, but only one student has done this before. Overall, I am unsure if I really enjoy being in the lab and if I am truly more interested in a chemical education career. I admit, I am young, but I have also experienced a lot of life-altering events that have changed my viewpoint on life. You have no clue how long you are going to live; anything could happen. Why not make the best of it and choose the routes that will make you happier? Obviously, philosophy is not my forte, but I think you get the point. I have family and a fiancé who are supportive of my decision, no matter what. I need non-biased tips and guidance, whether its guidance about figuring out what I want in life, how to handle depression through a Ph.D., or how to best decide which route to take.

WhyWearARomper,,2017-10-24 02:13:40,78cres,14,"Hello AskAcademia,

I am trying to figure out if it's even possible for me to make a return to academia in any way after a really bad flame out as an undergrad. In short I was a Philosophy/Physics dual major, and a combination of building depression anxiety caused me to have a pretty bad junior year where I started out around a 3.2 GPA and drove off a cliff from that point. 

Instead of seeking help I tried to make up the couple classes I had failed on top of doing all of the other senior level classes I needed. This went about as well as you think it would resulting in me outright failing 6 classes that year, losing weight to the point I barely had the energy to leave my bed, and being on the verge of suicide multiple times. I graduated with only my philosophy degree and the smoldering crater of my 2.4 GPA.

I found my way into an IT job and spent the last five years working my ass off to land in my current spot as an SRE (mix of software/systems engineering) at a well known financial company.

I know I have the aptitude to succeed at school now that I have years of experience and my other issues under control, I'm just not sure if it's even possible to go back at this point or what path to take. My company will pay tuition if I want to do another undergrad degree or post-bacc/masters in Computer Science, but obviously my GPA basically makes the latter two impossible, and the first one extremely difficult.

I want to take a second shot at this, and I really want to move into research someday if possible. As far as ever getting into a good school for graduate work, at this point how can I even go about that?

As far as I can tell, the only option I have that might even yield a small chance of success would be starting over as a non-degree student somewhere and taking classes until I can maybe get some kind of GPA waiver to get into a decent undergrad program (raising my GPA to the 3.0 required at most schools would basically require the credit amount of finishing a second bachelors already), then possibly transferring to a better school after performing well enough at the first. Even if I were able to do this, is my original undergrad GPA going to be a massive ball and chain I'm going to lug around forever in academia?

I've dipped my toes in already, and took a first year computer science class for majors as well as a discrete structures class at a CUNY school and did extremely well in both.

Any input is appreciated, and I have been thinking about this for a few years at this point. This is something I really want to do, I'm hoping you guys can provide some insight into what steps I should take.

Thanks!",AskAcademia,Returning to academia after flaming out in ugrad
phdisappoint,t2_6ezt6,2011-12-11 11:20:52,n8ebv,14,"Dear r/AskAcademia,

I'm a recently-graduated Ph.D. student (in the hard sciences) who has a few questions regarding the world of academia and job prospects, and I'd love to get some perspectives from those who have been in the game for a while.

Essentially my problem boils down to this: I have no publications and have been to no conferences, and these seem to be essential to get a job and move up the ladder in academia. This situation has come about partly due to the nature of my Ph.D. (it was co-funded by an external partner and thus IP came into it), and partly due to, well, a less-than-encouraging supervisor. So as soon as I see the request for 'a list of publications' in a position advert, I get very down about my prospects.

If I'm honest, I must admit that I'm not particularly enamoured with the academic system on the whole, as it doesn't seem to offer a whole lot of security. Speaking anecdotally, even good researchers within my group that have proven track records had a lot of trouble obtaining grants to start doing their own research. Fashion within science has played a part in the unemployment of at least one researcher I know, and university budget restrictions another. So how the heck do I expect to get constant work when I'm (seemingly) way behind the eight ball already? I know that independent research centres are an option, but they seem to be still reeling a bit from the GFC and recent worldwide economic changes (and since research is by its nature speculative, it seems to me that few are offering positions until they can be assured of work coming in from industry/commercial sectors). I'm at a bit of a loss about where exactly to look, as my training has been so specific I feel that university or university-associated centres are my only choice.

I admit that this sense of despair could all be a kind of post Ph.D. depression, but when the motto of every university academic is 'publish or perish', I think there's a basis in reality for it. I'd love to hear any advice or your stories in how you went about getting into a job that's within your field, or perhaps any steps sideways you might have taken?

**tl;dr** I am a recently graduated Ph.D student with no publications/conference attendances, am I screwed?

UPDATE: So I've since had a chat to my supervisor/s and we're going to work on a couple of papers over the new year. We've also been in contact with the external partner and they've given us some guidelines for what we can and can't talk about in our reports. Hopefully between this and a good cover letter explaining the delay I'll be able to round out my resume. Thanks so much to everyone for their advice and support.

NotAnInstructor,t2_dsm7i,2013-11-06 04:53:03,1q08yb,14,"I need anyone to talk to right now. I'm not sure what's going on but I feel like I've done something wrong or bad or incorrect.

I am a second year graduate student in a doctoral program. Last year, my first year as a grad student and at my institution, I was a TA for a new professor and we bonded very quickly. She became pregnant at the end of the academic year and I taught a few of her lectures when she had medical complications from the pregnancies. This year, before the semester began, she asked if I would cover the last week of lecture and the final exam (her due date was just after Thanksgiving). My understanding and what we discussed was that a senior professor (one who she doesn't share instructing philosophies with) would cover for her if she went into labor a bit early.

The problem begins with the fact that she began having medical complications again at the very end of September and would ask me to lecture about a day before class started. In total, I taught 4 out of the past five weeks (she was able to lecture one week in the middle). Last week I was informed that she had gone into labor approximately 5 weeks early and to cover the rest of the semester. All during this time we had been communicating one-on-one and I assumed she was speaking with her bosses. I had the vague feeling that the chairs knew of the situation but just let me continue since I was the only one to cover (the actual TA has a very, very poor grasp of the material). Prior to my mentor teaching this course, there was no true ""instructor"" and just a series of inefficient post-docs. I also didn't want to bring attention to the fact that my mentor and friend might not be 100% on top of a very new, career-making second year. 


Well...apparently no one of importance actually realized my mentor was permanently out for the semester. Now I have a bunch of people (chairs of departments, senior professors, my research advisor) all emailing me saying the exact same thing: ""I was just informed of this...we need to talk ASAP...are you okay...""   My advisor has assured me I haven't done anything wrong...but now I feel like I have?  It's like suddenly me commenting ""guess I'm teaching today!"" or ""Lecture went really well today!"" completely blew over everyone's heads until suddenly someone connected the dots and *fuck we have a second year teaching a sophomore lecture*.  And I feel like me asking for help, asking to have someone take over for me, is slightly betraying my mentor and casting her in a bad light and *oh jeeze I just feel guilty and don't know why*.

Side note: I've also in this time been on the edge of mental breakdowns, had to drop two of my three classes due to poor grades (inability to do crap-all), have sought counseling for anxiety and depression issues, and have started an antidepressant. None of which any of my department knows about.


TL;DR: I just need to talk to anyone.

I just met with the professor today, and he didn't seem to know what I was talking about. He offered to email me some papers to read (He didn't really get in to what about, but I'm assuming they're at least *his* papers) and also offered to let me watch his grad students work and learn from their technique. Nothing that sounded like the undergrad research experience I'm looking for.

Another problem is I suffer from anxiety and depression, and I'm afraid I came off as bored or uninterested in his work, mostly because I can be extremely inarticulate (as I'm sure this post makes painstakingly obvious). The fact that this particular professor just came from a prestigious university and seems to be a very important person in this field made that all the worse.

The thing is, though, I *know* I'm interested in his work, I just don't know how to express that.

It is often frustrating to me -- I wish I could just hop onto google scholar or pubmed and find out the ""right"" way to parent but obviously it isn't that easy.

Sometimes I run into topics that seem easy enough to study but aren't very mainstream. One example that comes to mind is placenta encapsulation -- a small minority of women have their placenta dried out and turned into little pills that they take after giving birth. Supposedly this helps stave off postpartum depression.

I think it would be easy enough to team up with some kind of midwife or doula who is offering this kind of service and do a small but well-designed study to see if there is actually any effect. It seems unlikely to me that it works, and if there is no effect it seems better to be able to point to a study showing that than to write it off as something gross and weird-sounding. Or if it does work, that seems important to know also.

But I think it would make me look like a lunatic. If, for instance, a hiring committee saw that I was studying something like this, I don't think their judgment would be positive.

I am a South Asian and I have a BS in Economics and an MBA. I currently work as a universal banker at a bank and I have three research papers in the pipeline along with a blog on Economics. I plan to pursue a PhD in economics. 

I hate math and I was always bad in math. But after I developed OCD I could not follow the long math like Calculus which were 10 pages long in MS in Economics. So I failed in the math courses in my BSEEE so switched to BSECON, failed math courses but got a good grade since I got the highest marks in all other courses and then switched from MSECON to MBA because I failed at math courses. But I really like Economics, especially the theoretical and philosophical parts and my papers and blog are on those type mostly. 

I want my degree to provide me with marketable skills such that after graduation I can get into a career that is in high demand worldwide and thus is in immigration lists, pays decently to maintain a family like other South Asians do, has good work conditions, the ability to switch if you have bad bosses or coworkers and fits in with my disability. 

I have OCD, Social Anxiety and Depression for the past decade and it has been very treatment resistant so I have been told to take it as a disability and build my life around it. I have trouble in the social functionality only because I have trouble with eye contact and cannot hold eye contact conversation. I face prejudice, discrimination regularly. 

I absolutely hate my current job, its conventional work with no innovation/creativity that is full of multitasking and lots of work for 11 hours five days a week. I am out of home from 8am till 10pm. Then there are sales visits during weekends. Customers are demeaning to service workers and coworkers tend to throw work my way because of my passivity and the new boss is bad. 

I believe that being an academic or researcher would suit me well. Very less politics, no bad bosses, can switch from bad bosses, less abusive and prejudicial coworkers, less need for social interaction and customer service etc. 

In Economics I have a wide range of interest, especially of using economic analysis in other disciplines, like space, AI, policy suggestions, IT etc. My papers are in various modes of publishing and they are on such topic. Not only that I also maintain a blog about such topics when my thoughts are not suitable for the narrow focus on journals.

TELEGRAF_ME_UR_NUDES,,2018-05-15 19:26:18,8jodpa,11,"Hi everyone,

I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask this question, but I'm quite stressed about this and I'm not sure what I should do. I'm a contract faculty member in a small department at a large \(= resourced; probably adverse to litigation\) R1 institute. I haven't renewed my contract for next year, but both I and my chair expect me to be here next year.

The issue is that I'm hard of hearing and suffer from clinical depression. This year, I taught a night class \(6:00–8:30\). This caused me a lot of difficulties. For one, I didn't have reliable way to get home at that time, so I often slept in my office. Secondly, it really exacerbated my usually\-under\-control depression. I often came home \(when I did come home\) crying, feeling suicidal, or feeling dizzy. I had to cancel all my meetings for Thursdays to recover, and I often was asleep until 3 or 4 PM the next day. Moreover, although I don't use an ASL interpreter, I was considering requesting one for the following year, and I'm not sure that there are options available for interpreters in the evening.

So, I've had several conversations with my chair about this, and she's been unwilling to change my teaching schedule. I've offered a few solutions to this \(swapping classes around\), but she's shot each one down. Who should I communicate with about this? I don't have a contract signed for next year, and I haven't been offered one yet, so I don't have much room for negotiation. Would it be self\-sabotaging to speak to the EEOC? Should I first try to get a note from my psychiatrist explaining my situation and give that to my chair first? Should I have a letter from disability services? I'm quite baffled at how unwilling she's been at changing the schedule, and I'd rather not reveal more health information than I need to, but do I have any recourse here? I'm afraid if I pursue anything, I just won't get a contract offer next year.",AskAcademia,Contract Faculty looking for accommodations for no Night Classes – Am I being unreasonable?
distressed_student34,t2_g9fp7,2014-04-23 07:18:29,23r1s7,10,"Hello all.  So, here is what I have going on and any answers would be appreciated.  

I am currently working towards my bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics.  I have been accepted on deferred admission to my first choice for graduate school and hope to attend in Fall of 2015.  My undergraduate studies are going great as far as academics are concerned.  I am currently pulling a 3.7 GPA

However, I am a little concerned for my mental state.  Last summer was the last time I was really content.  I was simply participating in some undergraduate research and taking a few summer generals (easy A's) on campus. As soon as the semester started, I became eager to take on some of the challenging and unfamiliar courses.  I was *pumped* at the beginning of the semester, my mind seemed to be a sponge for the acquisition of new physics and mathematics material.  It had always unfailingly been.

As per usual, at mid semester the the fervor began to wear out.  This isn't strange.  We lose our childlike wonder when being forced to hash through the details of a subject in some long assignment.  However, this time it never returned.  I had a difficult time finding the motivation to become unstuck from particularly difficult problems and the quality of my homework slowly declined until the end of the semester.  It came gradually.  At the beginning of the semester I was able to sit down for 3 hours at a time and enthusiastically complete all of the homework.  Then it would get the point where I would solve 4/5 problems with some measure of enthusiasm before merely writing something down for the 5th problem and declaring ""whatever, good enough"" in my mind.  Then this happened for the last *two* problems of the assignments, and eventually the last *three*.

I developed very severe hypochondria in late November and early December before Christmas break.  I thought I had brain cancer, signs of ALS and MS, skin cancer, liver cancer, and lung cancer all within a whirlwind three weeks lasting until the end of the semester.  I thought Christmas break would make things okay, but it didn't.  I was fearing illnesses all throughout break and could not think of anything else all break.  Because of this I found myself utterly unable to focus on assignments and my grades for my final assignments plummeted.  I ended my semester with a 3.2 GPA, which is quite sub-par for me.

My hypochondria dulled somewhat but is till present.  Winter break failed to cure my increasing apathy for physics and mathematics.  I complete every assignment, but I cannot focus on it.  I was going to graduate this spring, but I found the load overwhelming and had to drop a required course until the Fall semester in order to salvage grades in two other courses.  

When I dropped that class I became very ashamed of myself for not being able to do the initial coursework for the semester.  I became very depressed and started to briefly entertain suicide (thought experiments on how I could hang myself in my closet).  The combination of depression, apathy for the subjects of study, and sometimes hypochondria and loneliness have made studying and completing coursework more difficult than ever.  I have a very hard time focusing on homework and completing it with good quality.  The difficulty of my classes from this year to last has not changed insofar as class numbers are concerned.

At times I feel like an impostor and am deeply ashamed of myself.  I told my parents about my hypochondria but they would have none of it and am really afraid of their reaction if I told them I had thought of suicide.  Whenever I am doing homework my only thoughts are ""I absolutely do not want to do this"".  However, I am good at nothing else and do not want to work at a dead-end job and have regrets about not getting a graduate degree.  I am afraid that my family would be extremely embarrassed of me if I did not attend the graduate school I was accepted to.

Should I seek therapy?  Should I take a break from studies to regain my momentum? Should I cease my studies?  What is the recommendation?  Or is this just the normal grind for undergraduate students?

Any answers are greatly appreciated.",AskAcademia,Is the mental trauma I'm going through a normal part of the academic stress/grind? (Warning: A Bit Lengthy)
fumblesmcdrum,,2018-03-20 19:18:16,85vi1i,10,"**If you are diagnosed with (or suffering from) anxiety or depression, when (if at all) is it advisable to tell your advisor?**

I had this discussion with a labmate recently and we fell on opposite sides:

*Reasons for speaking up:*  Your advisor is a mentor as well as your boss and part of that training involves learning how best to navigate these responsibilities.  They can't help you if they don't know something is wrong.  Also, if things get to the point where it affects your work, then it's best to let them know the root cause and not have them assume things about your work ethic etc.

*Reasons to be quiet:* As a graduate student, it's your job to do the work assigned to you.  There is nothing your advisor can do from the point of view of your own mental illness, so it feels a bit like an excuse, and potentially unprofessional to discuss it.  Regardless of your condition, the same amount of work has to be done.  Your advisor is not there to hold your hand and help you through your problems.  If you are struggling with anxiety or depression, it's important to seek treatment, but do that in your own time and do not let it affect your work.

It's interesting to note that our particular approach to this topic seems map back to our advisor's (perceived) disposition, and our relationship with them.  i.e. one is seen as more gruff, another more supportive.

At the time, I should have frozen my enrollment, but instead, I thought I might go to school, but then I didn't. Also I didn't see any doctors so I have no documentation of depression if that matters.

1. I'm planning to talk about why I have a shitty transcript (just transcript, not GPA) in my SoP.

justletmestudy,,2018-03-09 21:00:29,83a3he,10,"I've decided to post here because I just don't know where else to go with my despair, so hopefully someone will have an experience that can speak to mine. 

Between 2014 to 2015 I completed an M.A. in Literature, Culture, and Theory at a prestigious university in the UK, finishing with top marks. In that same year, I fell madly in love with my partner, and upon graduating, moved to his home country of Singapore because he had a solid job offer and I didn't. At the time, there was a small voice in me warning that I might regret not staying in London and applying for a PhD, because I was in an excellent position to do so, and moreover, international students like myself have limited opportunities given the challenges of visas, etc. I stifled the voice, being too desperate to be with my partner to really care at that point. In Singapore I soon found work as a market researcher. The job killed my soul, but couldn't quit because I'm not independently wealthy and wasn't sure I could find anything better. 

At the same time, I began to hate living in Singapore and my partner and I discussed moving abroad, possibly to Canada or the U.S. My partner had previously expressed ambitions of pursuing a PhD in a STEM subject, so I pushed him to apply and eventually helped him find a research project and supervisor, which he is currently pursuing here in Toronto. 

Having moved three times in three years, it's been absolutely exhausting for me. I've been unemployed for 8 months because of the dire job market here. My partner readily acknowledges that I've been extremely supportive of his career, and is willing to do what he can to help me. I recently just accepted an offer from a community college to do a publishing certificate in September - but I don't know if it's what I want to do.

Here's the thing - I've been extremely depressed, to the point of feeling suicidal, ever since I left the academic world. I have always loved the humanities profoundly, loved the reading and the writing and the grappling with difficult concepts, and it feels like ever since I left in 2015 I have slowly been dying. To be fair, I have struggled with depression all my life, but when I still had my books and my professors and my classes, the despair of everyday living was held at bay. My mind and body felt alive, as long as they were preoccupied with intellectual inquiry. 

My professors always knew me as a bit of a model student due to my grades, but I'm actually not very professionally ambitious. I can't actually see myself as a professor, never even gave it a thought really. I'm not even sure I have the grit and determination to get through a PhD (and it seems like a terrible idea given the precarious job market). I just long to be back in the academic environment again, belong in a community where people understand what I am thinking and talking about. I want to be able to do nothing all day but learn, to no end, without end. Is there any way I can 'get back' to all this? Without necessarily taking on a PhD or another degree that I can't afford? I'm reading and attempting to keep up with discussions on my own, but it's just not the same - I constantly feel anxious and lonely. 

I know I sound incredibly naive and self-indulgent, but please be kind. My problems obviously don't all stem from the fact that I left the university, but learning and scholarship has been my greatest source of comfort all these years. I've started down the path of self-harm, and I'm really afraid that I have started to unfairly resent my partner for the choices that I chose to make.

Grandma is funding tuition and has specific requirements but I can't just quit my job..

But I am becoming very frustrated, and my uncle is basically dictating everything and being a jerk about it. When I was at the community college and working full-time, I only took 9 credit hours a semester.   

My uncle says, ""Just for comparison: your grandmother was required to take a
minimum of 18 semester hrs in teacher's college,  At Xavier
university, where I started out, everyone had to take at least 21
hrs/sem.  We both took more than required.""

**edit**: Thank you for all the comments - advice and personal experiences. I really appreciate it but here is a little more background information.  

I'm going into Uni with declared major of Bachelor in Liberal Arts, minoring in Environmental Studies. May switch to a Bachelor of Arts: Environmental Studies later...

Gma and Uncle made an exception that Gma WILL fund 15 credit hours this fall semester, BUT I have to take 17 credit hours next spring to make up for that 1 credit hour. Uh. I don't know if they understand the whole 'hours' thing. The degree plan is set up so that every semester you take 15 credit hours, besides semesters where you take a lab + lecture = 5 credit hours. And Year 4 I'll be required to take 13-16 credit hours. But basically just have to earn 120 credit hours total to graduate with a Bachelor's.   

ALSO - I am going to be checking with work to see if I can work 20-27 hours a week.. instead of 29.5 hours..    may help a little with the whole time management thing.   

Let it be noted - I do consider myself smart.. and I do have a lot of potential (that I am not currently NOT living up to.. LOL.) I am not strongly motivated/dedicated, lack commitment at times, don't really have a superb work ethic, and I'm currently seeking therapy/psychiatry sessions for bipolar type 1, depression, and GAD (not that that is an excuse..) but still. Sometimes I feel things aren't as easy for me. Stress wears me down to a point of emotional/mental breakdowns and panic attacks at times... Hmph.   

I wish I didn't have to work.. but I'm a 'grown up' -   it would all be much simpler lol but I can't afford that.. I have bills, commute to school.. so have to pay for gas, vehicle upkeep, cell phone bill, food, items to take care of myself, $40 copay for therapy (more frequent) , $40 copay for psychiatrist (every 6 weeks at the moment), etc. I should probably quit smoking cigs.. lol.. and luckily my mother is taking over my car payments and insurance ($496 off my monthly bills..)

A bit of background: I'm 19 and have had moderate to severe depression and anxiety for the past 8 or 9 years. I've been in and out of counselling and had a brief stint of normalcy that lasted about a year and a half (ended this past autumn). That normalcy was brought about by me getting serious with my boyfriend who is my rock, and because of him I applied to go to university in England (I'm American, he's British) and we moved in together, and with my life looking so positive and happy all of the negative feelings faded. However, when I started my course, I became incredibly depressed. I realised I hated my course and talked to my advisor about switching out but it was too late in the year.

I managed to do alright (mentally) the first 4 months, but when I had a critique on my 3rd project that I was beyond proud of and the teachers hated it, I just snapped. My teachers had always humiliated me throughout the year, and I'd regularly leave the class to cry or take a breather, so I was just fed up. In February I stopped going to classes regularly. I went once a week, then once a fortnight, then once a month, and then we had all of April off and didn't go in during May at all. I spent the time lying in bed or moping about the flat. I missed my final portfolio review for my course, but I have 2 final exams for my other non-course-related subjects next week that I do plan on attending.

But back in September when I went to switch out of my course, I also realised I should apply to other universities for my new course. I've since heard back from all of them, and 3 out of 5 (2 rejections, not surprised) said that if I pass at a 60-65% for this year then I'm in. Unfortunately, I'm looking at a 40%. I talked to a few friends and my parents and they all suggested I write a letter explaining that I had a bad experience with the course and my depression and I was wondering if I could get the conditions relaxed a bit. The other 2 classes that I took that aren't related to my current course are related to the course I want to switch to, and I have a 70+ in those, so I hope I could use those as proof that I would do well in the new subject.

I've always been really embarrassed about my depression, and it's hard for me to put it into words. Anyway, how do I do this? Is this even a good idea? If there are any UK redditors, do you think this will help, or will they just toss my letter aside?

tl;dr: Finished my first year of uni in the UK as an American, but didn't get good marks due to depression/terrible experience. Applied to other unis, received conditionals that I can't achieve, want to write a letter explaining my situation, need general feedback if this is a good idea and what to include/leave out.

I'm lucky enough to be associated with a pretty prestigious lab, and people are interested in my research topic.

However, my honours year has been a rocky one. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the middle of last year, which realistically was long overdue - I was super burned out, incredibly unhappy and unmotivated, and barely functioning in day-to-day life. Accordingly, I got very bad grades (is, only passing grades) in my first semester of honours. 

I tried to come back for the second semester of last year, which was supposed to be my last, but realised a few weeks in that I was in no state for it - couldn't go to class, couldn't hand in assessment, was just going to fail out. So I deferred my study until this semester, and used the time to get treatment, see a psychologist, and sort out my own head. 

So, I'm now in my third semester of honours, and I'm doing much better - feeling better, using better coping strategies, getting way better grades. I still have blue days, but I've learned to deal with them and stay motivated and productive. I feel that I can do alright this semester, and hopefully at least salvage a second class honours out of the wreckage that's been the last 14 months. 

I'm worried, though, that some poor grades and a couple of 'withdrawns' on my transcript will kill my chances of a PhD. How should I handle this issue in my applications? 

For example, I applied for my dream PhD program last year, and was told ""Your research experience and references are excellent (ps: they are. I have heaps of research experience), but your current grades are too low to be considered for a scholarship"". The same program contacted me yesterday, asking if I wish to be considered in the next round of PhD offers.

Oh god, I so do. But my transcript is (to date), the same as last time + those ""withdrawns"". I hope that by the end of this semester, it'll be more competitive, but that's in the future.

Should I explain my situation to them? I have certificates covering my deferred period which state that I've been in treatment for ""a medical condition which affects her concentration and performance"", without mentioning depression specifically. 

Maybe if I attached one of them, stated that I deferred study to be treated, and that I am now recovered and anticipating better grades, my poor performance would be looked upon more leniently?

A bit of back story (skip to end if you don't want to hear the sob story): When I was in high school I thought I wanted to work in theater, but by the end, I wasn't so enthused anymore. After a lot of soul searching I decided on physics, specifically astrophysics, which I had loved since I was a small child. I was living in my car at the time, but I decided to enroll in community college and give it a go. I figured if I didn't make it in physics, I could switch majors to geology and move forward from there. I spent a few years eking by at a local community college. While there I found that they didn't offer the classes I need very regularly, but I could finish a transfer degree with a focus on physics in three years. Three semesters before I was supposed to finish, I got into a major car accident. The only reason I'm mentioning this is because, while I was already playing catch-up on math because of my ill-conceived plans of being a Broadway star, the head injury I sustained in the accident set me back even more. Skip forward a little and the community college I was attending decided to stop offering some of the classes I needed to transfer. No one told me I could make those up at a 4 year (still not sure if I could have or not, but it's moot now), so I moved to Berkeley and finished my transfer degree and got into a State school.

I spent a lot of my time at state very alone, very poor, and very hungry. I struggled with literal starvation, as well as serious depression and anxiety to the point where my grades plummeted BUT I STILL MANAGED TO GRADUATE. Very aware that I was not mentally or physically fit enough to continue onto my PhD (not to mention I was too broke to even afford to take the GRE), I returned home to Washington where I grew up. It's been almost two years since I graduated, and I have a really fun job selling telescopes. Now that I'm healthy again I'm starting to look forward at what I want for a career. There's a lot of programming jobs in the area that pay a lot more than I'm making now, that with a little work I could easily qualify for, but what I really want to do is look for exoplanets. I know this requires that I get my PhD, but that's more or less the extent of my knowledge of how to move forward.

Here's the rub: I spent so much time moving around I never really made any connections or learned how this career path works. Also, I've never managed to work on any real projects, no internships, no senior project, nothing and on top of that I'm the breadwinner for the house, so I can't take unpaid opportunities. I can program a little, I'm great at writing papers, I'm good at astronomy, I'm decent at calculus, but I'm terrible with people. So I'm asking where do I go from here?

I know I need to take the GRE and apply to PhD programs, but what do I need to do to get into those programs besides take the GRE? Would a programming job help my chances of long term employment more than continuing to work at the telescope store where I have a flexible schedule (which i assume will be helpful when I'm in school)? Are there things that my current path of telescope sales would fit better with than looking for exoplanets? How do I find a mentor? do I even need one? Are there other questions I should be asking but don't know to?",AskAcademia,"Career Advice: I'm stuck in a rut after getting my B.S. in Astrophysics, what's next?"

Thank you in advance to anyone who replies to this post.      


Here is the background: I was diagnosed with severe depression two years ago. Last year I started taking medication from my primary doctor to help me manage what I couldn't. My regular monthly appointment was cancelled due to my doctor falling ill and there was no follow up. I contacted my doctor's office the following week to schedule a new appointment and found they had left for vacation for two months. There is no other doctor at the practice and was told to wait it out.     


My decline was gradual and didn't get a wake up call until I was sobbing on my floor and my email was at 900+ unreads.      


My mentor has been trying to contact me but I kept putting it off and now I'm here.     


I'm back on my medication and am trying to pick up the pieces, but I don't know how to apologize. I want to apologize and have it be sincere. I don't want to use my depression as an excuse but my friends are encouraging me to include it in the apology.     


If you've made it this far, I guess I'm looking for advice from other academics on how I should apologize. What should I include and omit? I’m hesitant to talk about this in person because I’m still adjusting to my new meds and cry anytime I think about these past two months. I need to own up to my mistakes so I can move forward and acknowledge all he has done for me, I just don’t know how.",AskAcademia,I have been out of communication with my mentor because of severe depression and I need help crafting an apology
burntoutfedup,t2_dma9d,2013-10-23 07:12:50,1p1bjj,9,"I created a new account for this, I'm in my 4th year of my Ph.D. program in ecology. I'm set to take my written exams in a few weeks, my proposal is in it's final edits, and this semester is the last of my classes. I've got a B-average. 

My program seems to have been plagued with hurdles: I attempted a duel degree program and the 2nd masters fell through; I Changed projects after my first year at the suggestion of my advisor; I Delt with a bout of depression that took a year to figure out; and I've moved to a new location and I am working from home now. 

I see my advisor very little, he manages a big research budget for multiple labs. He's had some health issues as well that has limited his availability; however, I'm mostly ok with this as I expected it and up until the past year I've been able to get attention when I need it. 

Last spring, at a conference, I ended up getting a very nasty voicemail after a day of bad cell signal resulted in missed calls. We had a few hours before the poster session/social and were talking at the hotel with some beers. He called while we were wrapping up and heading over, but we were running 5-10 minutes late. The voicemail attacked my character as an individual, criticized my leadership, and highlighted my failures over the past year along with noting a change in my behavior (I'd been on medication a few months at this point). The next day, all seemed well with him. He complimented my talk, and so I let it go as I suspected he might not have been all together that night. Things have been distant ever since, not strained... we just haven't seen each other and the interactions we have had have been short, almost curt. 

Fast-forward to this semester. We set up my written exams last month and I emailed all my committee members individually to ask them if they were ok with the date and me taking them from home. I also asked for guidance on what to focus on. I did not cc my advisor, I just sent him an email later saying everyone confirmed and we were good to go. Yesterday, I was emailing back and forth, talking about comps and he sent one asking if I had asked my committee what they would focus on, said he suspected I hadn't, and requested I CC him. I replied I had last month, gave him a summary, then compiled another email with all of theirs copy/pasted. This upset him, and I'm now on my own for coordinating my comps. I sent him a quick reply, apologized and explained why I did what I did... but have not heard back since.  
  
I get the feeling I've worn out my welcome in the lab, and I'm feeling a little like Milton in Office Space. I'm not sure if it's been the stress of last semester, or trying to work alone out here, but I find myself laying awake at night wondering if it's really worth it. I think of calling quits, taking time off, I dono. I'm at this threshold, I'm almost tempted to call them off, take a leave of absence or try to find another program locally... I don't want to loose the last 4 years though, and I feel if I don't finish this what adviser would take me in the future if a year or so from now I want to try again?  
  
EDIT/Response: Thank you for the advice. I feel ridiculous getting so worked up... but I'm exhausted. I will say, this is the halfway point, not the end. I still have the bulk of my research to do, or all the data analysis since the data is collected. I expect another 2 years before I get my dissertation approved.",AskAcademia,I think I want to quite my Ph.D.
NoxiousQuadrumvirate,,2017-12-06 11:50:27,7hxj2o,9,"Disclaimer: I've had a few drinks tonight. 

I've been working on this one project in astrophysics for close to 3 years now. We've had continual problems, and each time I fix one issue, it feels like 3 more take its place. To begin with I was really excited about this project, I'm still excited about the field, but after working on this for 3 years, I just f\*cking hate it. 

I mean I'd normally enjoy the work, but the fact that I'm just continually revisiting the same sh\*t over and over again is wearing me thin. I did the majority of this coding work as a freshman with no programming experience, and that's the code that I realistically have to work with now. It's just terrible, but it mostly gets the job done and I can't justify the months it'd take to learn rigorous programming practices in order to bring it up to industry standards. 

I just want to publish and move on with research, but this is haunting me and it keeps needing further clarification. Tiny errors or marginal uncertainties keep cropping up that'll take me a full week's worth of work to do, and I'm supposed to be on holiday for the next 2 months. At this point, seeing an email about it immediately brings me to tears. I just cry. It's burnout, but only for this one project and nothing else. 

What am I supposed to do about this? It desperately needs to be published, but the emotional cost is just getting higher and higher and I'm predisposed to emotional instability (depression, anxiety, hallucinations, etc). 3 years of looking at the same numbers has worn me thin. This experience is just hell for me, there's no other way to describe it at this point. But it's publishable work to a first-author standard, so I really have to keep going.

StunningAcadia,t2_3dflhguy,2019-03-09 04:11:55,ayzhla,7,"I hope this is the right place to ask this, if not, sorry in advance.

I've missed a lot of one of my classes this semester and I got a message from the prof today titled ""Attendance"" that I'm currently too anxious to read. I'm not trying to excuse it, but I've been struggling with a really intense wave of depression I haven't been able to shake for the last two years and it's just been getting worse and worse, leading to this mess I've gotten myself into.

It's not that I've just been letting this spiral out of control with no treatment, either. I've been on three or four different anti-depressants, all of which gave me really bad side effects I couldn't handle. I'm seeing a psychologist regularly, but she isn't really much help because nothing prescribed is really working and the latest thing she prescribed isn't covered by my insurance and I can't get ahold of her or get her to call me back about sending out a prescription for something that is. I was also seeing a therapist regularly, which was very helpful but she moved a while back and I haven't been able to find someone new I click with yet. My regular GP is on maternity leave right now as well, so I can't just go to her to talk to her about getting something else prescribed or try something else therapy wise when the things my psychiatrist are giving me are making me sick/apathetic.

On top of all of that, I moved out of my parent's house a while back to try and make my life easier (much shorter commute to school and work) and it's been a bit of a nightmare ever since. Heat issues in my building started in october and were finally fixed a week ago (it's gotten down to -40 degrees celcius where i live and I don't have a car), and three weeks ago my building had a bed bug outbreak that's made sleeping at night almost impossible, not that it was very good to begin with, and shot my anxiety through the roof. I don't really have any friends at school anymore and I live alone, so I don't have anyone to be accountable to in terms of getting up and being a productive/responsible, so a lot of mornings my alarm goes off and I just can't get up and instead spend most of the day in bed crying and hating my life and myself. 

I'd originally taken a semester off to get this treatment plan going when my mental health issues started to get really bad, but it just seems to have gone to complete shit over the last year and moving was probably a terrible mistake. I know none of this excuses me missing class and I shouldn't use mental illness as a crutch, but I don't really know what to do to get back on track at this point.  One bad decision has just spiraled into many more. 

To be clear, I'm not behind in any of my classes, I have all my worked turned in, and my grades have all been fine. This one grade's on class participation though, so I'm probably a bit screwed on that front. I'm going to work on figuring out what my next steps should be to get my life back together over the weekend, and I think dropping this class is going to be the first step in all of that. 

I know this professor pretty well, I've taken 4 other classes with her, but she intimidates the hell out of me and is really hard to read. I can't tell if she likes me or hates me. Should I talk to her, and what exactly should I say to her? She already kind of know about my mental health issues, as I've brought them up in a class discussion before and I have disability accommodations(for another condition), but I just really have no idea what to say.

tl;dr
I'm a giant mess and missed way too much class already this semester, but have kept up on the work in class and have gotten good grades on what I've submitted.

One of these professors even said, ""Whether you go now or later on in life, I expect that you will have a PhD level of knowledge within 10 to 15 years."" 

While I feel that grad school would be great for me, I'm unsure about it. Honestly, hearing this from my professors has actually scared me a little. Psychologically, I don't feel ready.

Years ago I always had a goal in mind with my career and I definitely wanted to be an academic in a very specific field. 

During my bachelors degree I met a woman who at first glance was everything I wanted - supremely intelligent, kind, etc... Alas, there was one niggle: she didn't know what she wanted to do in her life / career. 

This caused problems. I had a set goal, but had to work hard to get there. My girlfriend at the time did not have a goal, but vastly surpassed my intellectual capacity and used my own goals as her goals. This introduced a horrible competition to the relationship, mostly from her side, which made it borderline manipulative and caused a rift between us. It's very sad as the outcome could have been the opposite if it was only done in a way that was kind (Think ""power couple"") , pursuing our dreams together etc, but alas it didn't happen. 

In the end, she ended up cheating and I left. I spiralled into a two year episode of pathetic depression and blamed all my failures on her. 

I eventually got over myself and managed to get a PhD in the field of my dreams. All things aside, I should be succeeding and flourishing as an academic, but I'm not. 

A huge part of this is the manifestation of severe imposter syndrome, almost as a form of ptsd from my previous relationship. A lot of my deskmates are competitive, and consistently seek approval from me despite the fact we are in vastly different fields.

I ABSOLUTELY want to succeed.

phdthrowaway9999,,2017-08-17 04:38:31,6u7owt,7,"Hi all, using a thowaway because some of my colleagues know my regular username. I'm going to try to lay everything on the table, and would love to hear form anyone whose got insight or advise, but I'd especially love to hear from those of you who maybe took time off during your phd or those of you who left your phd and found fulfilling employment elsewhere. Apologies for any typos, errors, or generally scattered thoughts, this has been weighing on me for months and is now coming up as word vomit.

I finished my MA in 2014 (social sciences), and was accepted to a pretty highly ranked PhD program. Upon arriving, I was assigned a first year advisor, who I thought I'd enjoy working with, but our relationship turned toxic pretty quickly. I completed my first year with only a few hiccups, but mostly in good shape. Over the summer I sought a new advisor who I think better aligned with my work style and research interests. She's an absolute heavyweight in the field, awards named after her and such, so it's sometimes very intimidating to talk to her, but she's immensely supportive and I value the relationship I've built with her. I began my second year with a fresh, optimistic outlook, but by the end of the fall semester, I was deeply depressed. I've struggled with depression and anxiety for much of my adult life, but I was to a point where I was barely functional. I sought treatment and barely finished the semester by the skin of my teeth, but mentally/emotionally things weren't looking good. I continued therapy/medication, but with little success. Spring semester (we're now in '16) was ROUGH. SO rough, that I was unable to finish. I felt I wasn't smart or disciplined enough to be there. I had some hardcore imposter syndrome. I couldn't get out of bed, I didn't care about any of my work, and I was skipping classes left and right. I approached my advisor and she suggested I take a medical leave of absence, and asking for incompletes in my courses (my advisor settled on giving me a B+ in her class because ""I know you learned something"" and I had completed nearly all of the work). So, I took a leave of absence with two incompletes. This past academic year, I adjuncted at the community college back home. While I've made some progress with my mental health, the above concerns are still a daily struggle for me (and I've accepted this is likely to be a struggle I'll experience the rest of my life). When I first began my leave of absence, I thought for sure I didn't ever want to go back. But I have a constant nagging that I'll regret that decision for the rest of my life. I had to deactivate my Facebook because every time a colleague posted about a publication, a good class, or a research milestone, I spiraled into deep self-loathing and jealousy. At the same time, I catch myself applying theories I've learned to everyday situations, and getting excited to explain something that's relevant to my studies to my friends and family.  It's now time to make a decision on returning to the program or not, and I'm utterly paralyzed.  That's sort of the basic structure of what's going on, but there's a little more at play here. 

I should mention that research isn't my all-consuming passion. I LOVE teaching, and parts of research really thrill me, but I'd definitely say I'm in this to teach moreso than to research. I'd love a job at a small liberal arts college, but that's a little far down the road for this discussion. During my two years in the program, I worked on several projects (though, not as many as I'd like, nor as many as my peers), and with my leave of absence, many of these have stalled or completely fallen apart. I don't yet have any first author publications, though I do have several conference presentations and an invited encyclopedia pub under my belt. 

I should also mention that I didn't build much of a support network while I was in the program. While I had several friendly acquaintances in my program, I failed to make any actual friends. I was incredibly lonely. 

Finances are also a concern. My GA stipend was fairly low, and I have no help from family, so I was taking out large sums of loans to be able to pay rent and live reasonably comfortably. This financial situation would have to continue, and I'll likely have well over $100k in loans if I finish the degree. 

I'm worried that the only reasons I want to finish are rooted in social comparisons and some (false) need to have a prestigious career. I'm worried that I've taken too much time off, that I didn't accomplish enough during my first two years, and that (with the current academic job market) I'll have an expensive degree and no job to pay for it. I'm worried that if the PhD program was a struggle, I'll never make it in as a professor. 

I'm also worried I'll regret quitting for the rest of the life.  I'm completely embarrassed anytime anyone asks what I'm doing right now. I've avoided interacting with close friends from my MA program, because I feel like I no longer belong. 

I'm happy to clarify or answer any questions, and I'm open to any advice, hard truths or encouragement. Thanks for reading and sorry for the wall of text!",AskAcademia,"Yet another ""should I leave my PhD"" post"
CompuNeuro,t2_xfv44,2017-03-18 05:45:04,602otc,7,"Hello!

So I am an undergraduate science student looking at about 1 year left in my degree program. As such, I think it's about time I start to have a really good understanding of what should (and shouldn't) go on there. 

For more background, I am currently studying Neuroscience and Computational and Data Sciences (double-majors) at my home institution, and my future course of action includes first applying to be an NIH PostBac IRTA fellow, then applying to MD-PhD programs, and finally to ending up being a Professor at an academic medical center, specifically focusing on Computational Neuroscience, focusing on translating the field to develop treatments or elucidate mechanisms of depression and other psychiatric illnesses. 

Here are my questions: *(WALL OF TEXT: hopefully the bold helps?)*

- **should I put ""unrelated work"" (in a vastly different field than my own) I've done on my CV?** as a freshman, I was required to complete a research project in the humanities (as I had very little exposure to the level of science required for science research at the time), and as such, I completed a 17pg research paper (and stood by a poster I made at our mandatory poster session) on mathematical fictionalism and its potential implications for the sciences. if I am planning on pursuing nothing related to the philosophy of math in the future fields described above, should I omit this paper and presentation from my CV? or should I keep it until I graduate from college since it's experience? am I allowed to remove it, or must my CV remain a comprehensive list of my works (i.e., would it seem dishonest to remove it)? 

- **should I put work that I am not proud of on my CV?** this is extremely embarrassing to admit, but like many individuals coming right out of high school, my maturity level was not where it is now. I spent most of freshman year ruining my sleeping habits, and procrastinating on my work until the last minutes it was due. as such, I definitely did not put in my best efforts on this paper. I would say the paper is still decent, but if I had the chance to do it over again with an attitude change, I know the potential finished product is leaps and bounds over what I turned in. can/should I omit this from my CV? questions above re: keeping it until I graduate and whether or not it is dishonest to remove are pertinent here. (I actually also did 2 high school research projects, both of which involved me picking things way over my head, so they sound impressive, but we're massive failures-- this question is also pertinent for those!) 

- **what about work that I did, but failed at?** spent a whole semester doing work, resulted in a poster presentation. afterwards, did a meta-analysis (very liberal use of this term) of the data, and showed how variable our data was. went back, and did some more tests; lo and behold, our assay kits were bad... does this still go on my CV? 

- **should I put projects I have done that are part of classes here?** as an undergraduate, I have (recently) run into research-based courses where my teacher is either asking us to design a study and carry it out through the course, or the teacher teaches both grads and undergrads. For example, I'm taking a behavioral neuroscience course where i am in a group with 3 other undergrads and we design a mouse study (wild-type C57BL/6J, no drugs, etc.--very conservative IACUC Application for the class) and carry it out, and write a final paper at the end of the class. we are actually submitting our abstract for the inclusion of our project in an end of the year symposium for our college. In a different example, I submitted a project with a very basic attempt to consolidate 2 different designations for health care shortage used in the US to my data visualization class (ordinarily taught for grads and undergrads, but only undergrads were in the course during my semester)-- I plan on continuing work on this project with the course professor, and hope to present it at a conference when it's finished. So for both/either of these cases: on the CV? on the CV only if presented at a conference/symposium? 

- **how should I list summer programs?** I have attended one summer undergrad research program (SURP), where I worked on a project, and was required to write up a final report/paper as well as deliver a 15min slide talk to the program directors, PIs, and other guests. Should I list this as an award (accepted into this program-- from what I understand, SURPs are NIH grants for their host institutions, so would I be incorrect in saying being accepted into the program is an award?)? can I list it as both the paper and the talk? I also plan on attending another SURP this Summer, so advice here is definitely appreciated!

- **can I list it as a paper if it's not published in a journal or conference proceedings?** e.g., my papers described all above!

- **how much leeway do I have for unofficial things on my CV as an undergrad?** e.g., my papers above, since they are not published in journal or presented at a conference...

- **do I remove my undergrad stuff when I get to grad school?** what about if I'm at the NIH as an IRTA PostBac fellow? 

As mentioned earlier, I am a science student, so any and all advice from anyone in the field would be super awesome!!

I have always had difficulty getting anything done. Be it routine jobs or research focussed jobs. I start with steaming interest in one and commit myself, only to lose interest completely very soon. Something similar happened in my phd program. In the 1st year I just kept questioning what I was doing, how pointless our field is, and how we keep publishing papers just for the sake of it. Now and then, I had moments of heightened interest which would quickly fade away. By the time I started my 2nd year, the weight of pending work got to me and I finally sought help from the mental health clinic at our university. I was later diagnosed with ADHD and depression, and have been on Adderall since January. Things have improved remarkably since then. I find my field more interesting, it is easier to read through papers, make sense of things, and even make sense of my own research (to come extent). It is still difficult to get things done on time though. However, since I am lagging behind so much in the program, the faculty does not feel good about my candidature. The PhD program chair has asked me to seriously consider if I want to do something else, and they will offer a terminal masters that can help me find jobs. I, however, am not sure about leaving academia. I feel that I have just found medical help, just figured out what my problem was, and given time will catch up with other students. I am not sure what to do. I am very fickle minded and always want to do hundred different things. So, I am not sure even if I go into something else it will be easier. I feel like I will always want to do too many things, will always question my career choice no matter what I do.

ilpescepalla,,2018-07-05 18:57:20,8wd29f,7,"Hello,

I finished a PhD in the humanities three years ago. I loved it. I had no depression whatsoever, and I loved the academic environment. I loved writing. I loved research. I loved my topic. I don't regret it.

However, I graduated in December, and December is a really hard time to apply for jobs in academia. Moreover, I had no publications, and wanted to take a breather, so I worked as a teacher in a private school as an academic English tutor. Money was good, the job wasn't bad, so I stayed a couple of years. Meanwhile, my thesis was accepted for publication with a good publisher, and has become a monograph this year.

This Spring, I quit my job for a myriad of reasons including boredom. I would love to go back to academia. I feel I still have things to say in my field. I like teaching, and I have experience, so I've been applying for academic jobs. I just have a nagging suspicion that I'm not good enough with a single monograph under my belt.

What are the chances today to find an academic teaching/research job in the humanities for me?  Should I try harder or just give up?

I am in field of CS and i am an international student .My MS was completed in DEC ,but my advisor could not find good CS students to work on her projects so she promised to help me find a job if i stayed back and helped her with her projects .I did .


*( I am an international student and i need to get a full time job by APR ,otherwise i have to leave country and this is my second masters.I brought this to my advisors attention and she said she understands that)*

3 Weeks ago , i asked her if it was possible to do a PHD with her. She said she has to look into fundung and get back to me. So we met last friday and she told me she has no funding and her contacts did not show any interest in my profile. So she  asked me to find a job myself and move on. She advised me to apply for some companies but she said she doesnt know anybody there , which is a big lie because i know her close friends work there.

I finally broke down in my lab.I stayed  back for her but she is deserting her student of 2 years who did thesis under her at most important time of his life. 

Another professor in my Dept. does Operations Research and he knew i am good in CS ,so during a talk last month he had offered me PHD( i mentioned this to my advisor and she said not to join his lab and said they do crap research) . So last friday after meeting with my advisor , in heat of the moment i went into his office and asked him he was still interested. He said yes ,and he contacted my advisor if she was ok with it and started working on the application.

I came to know through him that all non tenured professors(my advisor) have their first year PHD students expenses supported by grad school . So she lied to me that she doesnt has funding.

When she came to know that i am going to work with him , she has stopped responding to my emails since Friday noon. I have asked her for chat but there is no single reply.She did reply to the other guy in lab this weekend.

Honestly ,i am not interested in Operations Research and i was kind of  angry with my advisor so i asked the other professor to start PHD process. Over the weekend , i thought for long and have come to conclusion tha5t i have no interest in his subject and i will tell him  that tomorrow before he dispatches my application to graduate school.

What should i do right now?Should i tell my advisor sorry? She betrayed me and she is not talking to me as if she feels betrayed .I dont want to join other professor just to maintain my status in US . I am genuinely interested in her research but i dont know what do at his point ,its a mess involving 2 professors.

*UPDATE : The grad students in other prof's lab had told me earlier he had denied PHD to two other students last week earlier in belief that i will somehow join his lab . I didnt want to join him ,leave in betwen and jeopardize his research. It will be very difficult for me to work on something i am not motivated on for 4 years.I met with my advisor again and this time she said i dont deserve a PHD. Ironic part is she herself was an international student during 2001 and she didnt get a job due to market depression 9/11 and a professor offered her PHD then. Amazing how people change. I know i am screwed now but i just hope i get a job somehow.*

           I’m really hoping to get some guidance from you on going back to college. Two years ago I graduated from a university with a B.F.A. (Bachelors of fine arts) and now two years later I’m living at home with my parents working a part time job. I have gotten nowhere and just come to terms that I really need to go back to college and get something better.

After  graduating I was planning on working on my portfolio but it hasn't gotten anywhere because of going into depression/inability to concentrate on one things. I'm really tired of being that person.

I’ve decided to go into accounting and am planning to get a master in the program. While my parents are supportive and excited for me I have no idea on where to start. I’ll have to get a bachelor in accounting but hoping to take a lot of classes at a community college to help save some money. Would I contact the community college or the university first? Who should I talk to help me plan/transfer? If anyone took classes originally at a community college then transferred over to a university what was it like for you? Is there any stuff I should know to be sure that credits transfer? I now live in a different state from where I got my B.F.A., would that cause any problems in transfers? If anyone has tips on planning for going back to college that would be helpful too. 

I’ll be sure to add some more questions once I think of some more. Sorry for the dumb questions but I really been having a hard time finding experiences from undergraduates who are going back to get a degree in a different field. Thank you to anyone who answers any of these questions.

throwaway19851992764,,2018-08-26 15:21:46,9agaj9,6,"Hi everyone,

Any advice or thoughts you have would be great. No need to sugarcoat. I like this sub a lot and have been lurking for quite awhile now. I apologize in advance for the length of this, I just don't know where else to turn to get objective advice. I can't get a read on if I've smeared my name forever in this program or if I still have a chance to turn things around.

Background: I am going into my 2nd year of my PhD. Classes start Monday. I spent nearly all of my 20s working on getting into a doctorate program (BS, MS, tons of research and practice experience, 5 rounds of GREs, two rounds of applying....etc). I four pointed my master's and worked my ass off and finally I got into a great program. Aaaaaand now I've proceeded to royally fuck up this past year.

I have always absolutely sucked at doing things ahead of time. I'm a procrastinator at heart. I also avoid things that make me anxious (e.g. big assignments) like the plague because they freak me out. I got through my BS and MS without this messing me up very much. I missed a deadline here or there but it was never the norm.  I was diagnosed with ADHD after my bachelor's but never needed/sought any accommodations during my master's. Now in my PhD its become absolutely impossible for me to meet deadlines in my classes and I'm not sure what to do next. Most of the time my GA work hasn't suffered the same (e.g. I've kept up with the deadlines there), but its getting worse.

One class first semester is a good example because it was particularly terrible. I am not exaggerating when I say that I think I turned in almost every single assignment in that class late. I also showed up consistently late to the same class. Sometimes I missed class. It was just an absolute shit show. I met with my professor halfway through the semester and was like ""I am so sorry, I don't know what my problem is but I know it is not OK and I'm trying to work on it"". He told me he didn't care about my tardiness in his class because my work was good and usually only a few hours late, but that it would definitely bite me later in life if I didn't shape up. Obviously he is correct. Every time I missed a deadline I'd swear up and down to myself that I'd never do it again and I'd learned my lesson...yada yada...and then I'd miss another one soon after. I thought maybe my mental health was the problem (I have anxiety and depression in addition to ADHD). I got myself back into counseling and started seeing a psychiatrist again for medication management. My depression is better but my anxiety and attention issues are still problems and at times make quality of life quite difficult. I somehow passed all my classes with A's and B's and swore second semester would be better. ...I'm sure you can guess what happened next.

Long story short - 2nd semester was also a shit-show. I again had major issues with tardiness. Sometimes I made up excuses. Sometimes I didn't. I kept waiting to get called out or get in trouble but no one said anything. I kept going to therapy and taking my medication and promising myself I'd figure it out. My therapist advised me to get accommodations because of my mental health, so I did. I met with the grad director about the accommodations (basically just to tell him I had them) and he was very understanding. He said he had not had any complaints about me or my work from faculty. I kept telling myself every time I missed a deadline that it was the last time. It never was. I lied (claimed technological problems, etc) my way through submitting all my finals late in all my classes at the end of second semester, which I still feel like shit about. Somehow no one called me out and I got A's in every class, which again - I don't understand because I don't understand how I am not being penalized for all this late work.

So onto the current issue...

This summer we had a huge project to complete that you have to pass to continue on to comps. It was basically a thesis and we had 4 months to do it. I've done a thesis. I know how time consuming it is. But I got married this summer (which has been planned for over two years so it's no excuse - I knew when it was happening for a loooong time) and let myself get distracted with wedding planning and moving and other research/work. I put writing the project off until the last minute, knowing full well it was a mistake but lying to myself that I'd have enough time. The deadline came and I had approximately half done. I had no choice but to just once again just turn in what I have and say ""I'm so sorry I know this is unacceptable but here's what I have. I will turn in the finished product ASAP. Totally know it probably won't count but I just want you to see that I'm capable."" Now its more than 24 hours after the deadline and I still have a fuck ton of this project left. I'm an emotional wreck and I'm so ashamed and disappointed in myself and want to just say ""I'll fix it next time"". But frankly, I don't know if I will. And who knows if I will even have the chance - there is a chance I could get kicked out over this. Or have to repeat my entire first year. The project committee is meeting to figure out what to do with me.

I'm fed up and exhausted and so is my husband (who has been riding this emotional roller coaster with me). As much as I love my program I just don't know if I should continue. If I am going to continue to mess up, I feel like leaving now is a better idea. I am currently ruining a good reputation I worked YEARS to build and replacing it with a shitty one that I don't want. Which is more irrational - to keep saying I'm going to magically break this pattern or cling to the possibility I could figure it out? What if this is just a sign that I don't want this PhD enough or care enough about my work?

I keep seeing job announcements that sound cool through our school that only call for a BS or MS and thinking ""If I could be happy with that, what the hell am I doing a PhD for?"" I'm second guessing all my original reasons for coming here in the first place. I'm about to turn 30 and haven't started a family yet. Maybe I should just throw in the towel and focus on the other things in life that could make me happy besides my career. I don't really care about publishing - I'm in this PhD for the research training and the applied work it will open doors to in my field. Maybe that is also a sign I should leave though? But if I do leave I know it will feel like I've wasted a ton of the last 10 years of my life - which were all focused on getting into grad school. 

Do I leave? Do I stick it out? I don't know what to do. Even if I do stick it out and manage to get my shit together - how much damage have I done already? Is it fixable? I feel like as a professor I would just be totally fed up with me by now.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr - 2nd year PhD student, huge issue with tardiness to class and late assignments all first year. Apparently my quality of work is fine because I somehow got by with no lasting consequences and ended 1st year with good grades. Keep telling myself I've learned my lesson, but in reality I clearly haven't because I keep turning stuff in late. Mental health may be a factor but I feel like I'm already addressing it all I can (counseling, medication, accommodations). Just left huge summer project until last minute because I didn't prioritize correctly. Turned it in unfinished. Working on finishing but no idea if it will matter or how much longer it will take me. Have to pass said project in order to move on to comps at end of 2nd year. Committee is meeting to figure out what to do with me. Super frustrated and feel like maybe I just don't want this enough. Very bothered by the bad reputation I know I am building. Not sure if I should cut my losses and move on, or keep going.

By mid-semester I had an A in one of my classes, but failed the other two. I made the idiotic mistake of not going to any of my classes and basically withdrawing from life (minus my job, I didn't want to end up homeless) due to the shame of my failures. I had very little support and no one in my family has ever been to college, so I didn't know what to do. So, it didn't surprise me at the end of the semester when I received a letter of academic suspension.

I have continued to work full-time for the past 6 years and have been seeing a psychologist for the past 3 years. I now feel like I am in a position where I can be successful in school again, in addition to only working 35 hours a week. I also am only interested in attending on a part-time basis.  

I am in the process of writing two letters, one a letter of appeal to be readmitted to this university, the second, to petition for academic reprieve which will reset my GPA because I am past the minimum 5 years.

I am wondering how much information I should include in these letters, what would be inappropriate? I am a very private person, so is it necessary to include my struggles with depression? I dread sharing any information on that topic. Also, the petition asks for any documentation to be included alongside the letter. Would it be helpful for my psychologist to contribute in some way?

For the appeal for readmission how can I explain my reasoning for essentially quitting when it got tough, because I realize now how illogical a move it was. I had options but instead I chose to avoid my problems.

I realize this is a lot of questions so if anyone has advice on even a part of it I would really appreciate it. Thanks!

bigolmonkeyfarm,,2018-05-25 03:13:35,8lylld,6,"Preface: this is a longer post because I wanted to include detail for context. Thank you in advance for your consideration to offer insight.

I found out that my lab grade was getting penalized by my director a couple days after my college graduation by my new supervisor ""T"". 

For the last 4 semesters of college, I had worked as an undergraduate research assistant. The penalization shocked me, because I had earned A marks every single semester prior to this last one. To get an A in lab was relatively easy- all you had to do was put in effort and not miss lab meetings or studys. These were all things I thought I had done.

During the first 3 semesters, I worked under my supervisor ""R"". She was wonderful and was always offering constructive feedback. This last semester, I was put to work under my new supervisor ""T"", a grad student.

T was offered a lot of flexibility schedule wise. This was great for me, because my last senior semester was the one of busiest yet (e.g. pre-med coursework, job hunting/job interviews, tons of advisor meetings).

The following will explain why my grade got penalized...

The project I was working on under T required that I drive to 3 different child subjects houses and do a reading intervention with them for 30 minutes once every week.

My weekly interventions were this:
Tuesdays:
4:30PM- Subject #1
6:00PM- Subject #2

Thursdays: 
4:30PM- Subject #3

T set the times I'd be meeting with my families based off of my class schedule. He did not ask me if these times were okay with me before he told the families that these were their official intervention times. After I saw the schedule, I expressed to him that these times would negatively interfere with my Tuesday and Thursday midterm exams (6 in total for the semester, all at 7:15PM), especially the 6:00PM intervention. He said that rescheduling the official meeting times with the families was unfavorable, so, he offered some solutions for my midterm days.

Since the 6:00PM intervention was an actual time conflict that would have prevented me from making it to my test on time, he told me that on the day of my 3 Tuesday midterms, I could get this ""shift"" covered another RA, without penalty. 

Initially, he was opposed to me rescheduling or having my 4:30PM shifts covered on my midterm days. I'm very anal about test preparation, and I prefer to not have interrupted study time if I can help it at least 3 hours prior to an exam (keep in mind these tests were for bioch and advanced principles of chem and biochem). I went to my 4:30 intervention on my first Tuesday midterm day to see if it would pose a major conflict.

The hour that I lost doing the experiment an hour and half before my exam was not preferable. While doable, it made me extremely anxious. I went to my supervisor ""T"" again and asked if I could have someone cover my 4:30 shifts on my midterm days (or if I could reschedule with my families).

I was given a verbal ""thats fine as long as you keep me posted with when you will meet with families/who is covering your shifts"". So for the rest of the semester, I had another RA cover my midterm day interventions for me, or if they couldn't do it, I would ask the families if there was another time that week that they could meet. Sometimes I would still cover the 4:30 interventions the day of a midterm. Because I was changing the order of things on these days, I always made sure to keep my families informed at least a week or two in advance.

This was defined as an issue at the VERY end of the semester when the lab director discovered that I was having my interventions covered/rescheduled on midterm days. She decided to grade all of the final 8 week evaluations for the RAs on ""T's"" project. She deducted points for all of the interventions that I ""missed"".

In the syllabus, it says that you cannot miss an experiment. For my first 8 week evaluation, my supervisor ""T"" has in writing that I didn't miss any experiments. This was written after I had my midterm day interventions covered, so there was no indication that I should have viewed these as missing an experiment. Additionally, I think morally, this should be an exception to the rule since my supervisor created an actual time conflict with my tests and did not offer a proper solution vie the lab policy. I also do not think that I ""missed"" the interventions that were rescheduled because they were rescheduled- I didn't *not* show up for the experiment, because it was moved to another day.

I would have never done any of this if I was aware that this was against policy. I expressed all of this to the director of the lab and she is not budging. She told me that I can repeal my grade, but that she's also on the academic fairness committee (you can put two and two together).

This is why is matters to me:
Grade-wise, this was my last semester to land my very first 4.0. I got an A in all of my classes except this one, which I expected to get an A in. I was so excited because I thought I had done it. The 4.0 was a personal academic goal I had made for myself after beating my depression sophomore year.

Principal wise, I do not think that her response was justified. We emailed back and forth quite a bit. At points, my responses were emotional, but they were never disrespectful or mean towards her. In her responses, she got aggressive and insulted me multiple times. She also stated that I am the one completely at fault, and that my new supervisor did nothing wrong. Up to this point, she had thought very fondly of me and was impressed by my prior work. She even offered to write me a letter of recommendation for medical school before this. 

So to the main question, was her point penalty justified? If it was, I would like to know so that I can learn from my mistake. 

If it wasn't, what course of action should I take? I'm really upset about this because I put a lot of time and effort into lab, and really loved working there... but should I just let it be and move on?

I was somehow accepted to a small, well-regarded STEM PhD program after graduating from a subpar undergraduate program (community college -&gt; small satellite campus of a state university). Once I arrived, I didn't do well on my entrance exam. The grad chair of my department expressed disappointment, and asked me on multiple occasions throughout the following semester if I have ADHD and other learning disabilities. I never found a sense of belonging in my program, nor did I find a mentor figure. I lost all motivation to do well, and departed the program the following year.

A few years later, I have found stability via employment. However, this comes after a period of depression due to my grad school experience. I was also homeless for a short while as a result of my depression. Although I have lost all interest in my PhD subject and I doubt I will ever attempt grad studies again, I still spend a lot of time thinking about my experience. Is it common for a PhD student to have zero encouragement/support from faculty in their first year? Was it appropriate for the grad chair to ask me if I have learning disabilities? Should I have done something differently?

I recognize that things could have gone much better if my undergraduate program had been stronger. However, I'm a first generation student from a failing public school system, so I navigated higher ed without a mentor. I don't blame myself entirely for that mistake.

awhelkschance,t2_2hwyybpf,2019-06-30 23:19:43,c7l2qp,6,"I graduated from my PhD a couple of years ago, with a few first author publications under my belt. However, I felt for quite a lot of my time as a PhD student that I had accidentally rolled in to the field because I didn’t think I was good enough to work in theory/some other field I actually enjoyed (near-top undergrad at same institution as PhD, insanely-poor self-esteem issues, weird conceit about ‘theory vs experiment’ that seemed to be circulating the undergrads at the time. Go figure. Also, this is the UK — we don’t get to try out many things before we start out PhDs/ did very few project components to our degrees, and we typically have to just join one lab from the start — rotations only exist on specific programmes.)

As a result, I turned down some Ivy League postdocs in said field, likely because of pretty severe depression but also because I genuinely wanted to work on something else, having chosen a field that didn’t fit fresh out of undergrad, but knowing how much I enjoyed the bits of my research that weren’t in the lab (smidgens of modelling and theory here and there). The problem was, I didn’t think I was relevant/good enough to apply to things I was interested in because they were more computational/theoretical and I only had an experimental PhD. 

Fast forward a year and I’m doing a postdoc in an experimental lab in the US on something that I don’t really enjoy but I felt would at least make me useful to society. After a very short time when reality hit home (finally moving city will force you to properly assess your life) I realised I had got it all wrong and managed to leave with no hard feelings and the understanding I had erred. 

It’s now a year on; I got lucky and got a job in industry, and it’s ok but I know I can’t really do this forever and not want to go back to research — that would feel like I really have ruined my life. In a way, I have finally managed to recover from the awful depression and rediscover my passion — so it’s horrible to think that it has maybe cost me the thing I am passionate about. In fact, in the process of getting this job I realised how much I can actually do, and to some extent what I am capable of learning, and it really hammered home exactly what it is I am interested in. 

My question is (and sorry for the long post) — have I lost the chance to do research? In a new field that I really care about?

I’m a French grad student in Health economics in my final  year. I’m 28 yo. I have realized that public health research is not for me. I have few experiences and each time, my subject was disappointed. For example, the subject of my thesis is “The cost of a pathology”, so I measure the total amount that a pathology costs. My last internship was about the consumption of psychotropics in Europe, so I measured the consumption of psychotropics pills in Europe… 
Right now, I want to be useful to society. I’m a pharmacist, with two master degrees (public health and Health Economics/Health Technologies Assessment) and the next year a Ph.D in Health Economics. 
Previous work : 
Intership in epidemiology (4 mouth). This experience made me decide to do research.  It was cool, I analyzed the relationship between a drug and a pathology in a cohort. 
Intership in a state agency (6 mouth). It was a lot of data management, but the staff was great people. I measure the quality of a database about all inpatients in my country (so millions of lines).
1 year in ministry of health : about the consumption of psychotropics in Europe. It was a strange experience. I had finished all the tests after 2 months, then my supervisor left. I stayed 1 month without any hierarchy, and then the new supervisor asked me to continue analyses that didn't make much sense for 6-7 months. The kind of analysis I did ? PCA (principal component analysis) with &lt; 10 events… I felt in depression, because I believed I was too stupid to understand why this was a good idea when my supervisor was so confident.  
And actually my thesis (3 years) with a database with billions of lines and hundreds of row. Again, I have often fallen into depression. I see all my colleagues doing crazy stuff (modeling, machine learning, statistical testing) while all I am asked are averages and medians with no possibility to deviate. 
At the end of my day, I don't think I have any concrete skills to bring to anyone. All my previous work was descriptive. My results are relevant only for few officials who can put it in the introduction in a report.  That's why I would like to be useful. Do a job where I know that contributes to making this world a better place (after all, I am first and foremost a medical professional). I am currently interested in the Universal Health Coverage.. But I don't know if I have the talent to work in the World Bank or the WHO. I’m little bit lost. How to become useful ? Any advice ?

throwawaytwoships,,2018-06-14 21:05:16,8r5eac,5,"Using my throwaway in case this is identifying.

I started my second post-doc in the fall but am still close with the members of my last lab. The PI and I are friends, we meet at conferences a lot and catch up, and I learned a lot from him during my time (he respects his post-docs and treated me with nothing but care and respect). I also became good friends with many of the students, including one of his MSc students who is the subject of this post. During my time there (and during this post-doc to be honest), I struggled to find balance between being there for the students as a mentor and helping them navigate academia including helping them understand the PI's criticisms and suggestions, and also being an experienced scientist in the hierarchy of the lab and totally understanding my PI's point of view when it comes to the students' struggles or performance. 

The MSc student in question has had a particularly rough time with the PI. Her project is especially difficult and a bit outside of the PI's wheelhouse, such that he demanded results from her that were pretty unreasonable (to me at least) given the techniques she was using and her experience level. She worked her ass off, pulled all-nighters, and did her best with the demands and the time/resources she had, but it never seemed like enough for him. I saw in the lab and was able to see the nitty-gritty of it, her tears and struggles as she tried to keep him happy. After every meeting she had with him, we had to take a walk or close the office door because she would break down sobbing. I have had many life discussions with her trying to talk her down and help her through this time. The kind of language she told me he was using to communicate his disappointment with her is pretty brutal (ie. ""this isn't good enough,"" ""you don't belong in science,"" ""this isn't worth my time to read"" ""you should know better,"" ""how could you think this was ok?"" ""you aren't very good at this"" etc etc). She has a history of mental illness, including depression and anxiety and confided in me that she had attempted suicide before starting grad school. Now after a long haul of nonstop issues with her project, she is finally writing her thesis. He expects that she will be giving him these perfectly written manuscripts for each chapter from the first drafts, but has not provided her with any sort of guidance on how to write a paper (she has no publications and no experience with this). He expects that his students will instinctively know where to look for resources and will by some kind of miracle or brute force learn how to write. His edits to her chapters have been vague and unhelpful (for example, highlighting entire paragraphs and commenting with a single question mark with no explanation), and she is on a tight deadline to get her thesis done. Every step has been a struggle for her and he has been of little to no help, and frankly, barely a mentor. I should note that of the 6 graduate students he has seen through writing and defending (her included), he has had major issues with 5 of them (to the point of the PI and student not being on speaking terms anymore). 

From a purely scientific perspective, I agree with the PI that she could have managed her time better, that writing might not be her strong suit, and she could use some guidance with refining her experimental design. However, I absolutely DO NOT condone the approach he has taken to supervising her. Shaming students into performing is such an old-school way of going about things, and while he may have come up in this system himself, he doesn't seem to comprehend the effect it can have on well-being and mental health. While I was still there, she had a particularly devastating meeting with him where he told her she was worthless and that he was so disappointed in her, etc, and she went home feeling suicidal. I had to call her to make sure she was ok. The next day I went to see him in a closed-door setting and explained to him that he should be careful with the way he talks to her (while not giving anything away that would violate her trust). He brushed me off saying she was too sensitive and ""that's just how it is in science."" On the sidelines I have done everything I can to help support her, both in the lab with her experiments and writing, to outside of the lab as her friend.  

Ultimately, what is my responsibility as her friend and as a past member of his lab? Would I be out of place getting in touch with the PI and talking to him about his supervising style?

sleepspice,t2_4ina37aj,2019-09-04 13:34:38,czky6c,5,"A little background, I'm coming to the end of the first year of my PhD. It is an interdisciplinary PhD, so a lot of concepts are new to me. At the beginning of my PhD, I dealt with a significant personal loss which led to changes in every aspect of my own life and means I have to stay in a toxic home life. I've had to deal with bouts of depression and anxiety but actively get counselling to help myself and have managed to write and submit my first-year report despite challenges.

I kept my supervisor up to date on the situation, but in around April this year I had a burnout and took a month off. Since coming back, I've noticed my supervisors attitude towards me has changed. There have been several incidences where I've been left in tears and feeling awful because of their comments and the pressure placed on me. I've tried to address communication issues that may have been the reason for frustrations and remained as diplomatic as possible, but now I don't quite know how to proceed and whether I'll be able to deal with 2 more years of it. 

examples of issues have been 

* asked for time off for a religious holiday, initially asked for two days off for the event and was met with ""the school is monitoring you - so two days off wouldn't look good."" After speaking to a masters supervisor, I realised this was a lie. ( the school doesn't monitor you, and I had annual leave so I could take the days off)
* Berated me in front of an intern for being late to a meeting with them, despite the reason for being slightly late was attendance to a health and safety meeting which was necessary ( as we had an upcoming audit) and had texted in advance to inform where I was. 
* Refused to read a full draft due to minor errors ( that I didn't think were a priority as they could quickly be dealt with - i.e. table heading was below the table instead of above it) and claimed me making mistakes like that showed that I hadn't learnt anything. Went on to say they didn't know what I was doing with my time, that they didn't think I was going to pass, despite the full draft being there, and that I was being given a stipend so I should work etc. As well as saying if I'd submitted that it would go straight in the bin ( it was a draft so I would never submit it as it was).  At this point, I had worked consistently on this report to ensure it was all in so the comments were very unfair, and I said so.
* When asking for a leave of absence ( doesn't affect my research but means I'm given no stipend) to deal with mental health and burn out as a preventative measure, I was met with ""I should try being more positive"", ""maybe its not the right time for you to do a PhD"" and a comment along the lines of you took a break in easter so why is it you need to take a break again as these issues shouldn't 'carry-over'.

Though I understand that things said may be well-intended, situations could have been handled more professionally and I feel I don't know how to proceed. These comments have taken their toll on me. I don't want to quit as I do genuinely enjoy my project though experimental failures and imposter syndrome have gotten me down. However, at times, I genuinely believe the environment has become toxic, and I have tried to address issues, but it doesn't seem to be improving. I get the impression constantly that my work isn't good enough, and they seem like they've given up on me. I understand my work is not the best, and my experiments have failed, but I have powered through as best I can. Is there advice on how I could deal with the situation, should I look for another supervisor? Should I bring this behaviour up to the school office? Is this behaviour normal especially as they were understanding at the beginning despite the occasional clash?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a humanities PhD about to do my fourth year on the job market this fall. Thankfully I have nabbed two consecutive two-year post-docs, so all told, things could be much, *much* worse. I know I'm very fortunate to have benefits and a salary and time to work on my manuscript and don't take it for granted; I have had what a lot of people call unqualified early career success. The problem is that I'm extremely fatigued with moving to places I don't want to necessarily live for the thin hope of staying in a profession that has, in the last few years, sent me into bouts of depression more often than I care to remember. I strongly feel like I can rally if only I can obtain a ""permanent"" (haha) position, or at least I'd like to continue on if only to see if I want to remain in this profession for the long haul. The problem is that it has become increasingly difficult to perform the basic duties of my job (research, revision, course prep, etc.) when I feel like I'm hanging on by a thread all of the time and mired in depression and anxiety (for which I do see a therapist). I'm cynical about academia because of the rampant exploitation and laissez-faire attitudes from higher-rank academics about adjunctification. And, worse, I feel extraordinarily guilty for putting my partner through the hell of being married to an early-career academic.

I guess what I'd like to hear is stories from people in similar situations: how did you manage to compartmentalize or fight through early-career fatigue to stay productive and fulfilled (a question that's probably also relevant to early Asst. Profs, I imagine)? Or, if you've moved on to alt-ac (which I almost did this year if I had gotten the very cool job I was a finalist for), at what point and why did you make the jump?

[deleted],,2013-09-07 12:01:23,1lwsj8,5,"Ok, first some background. I have a BSc, and a BA, and am currently in the last half of an Honours year on top of my BSc (Physics, if it's relevant). I'm at a good university, and the Honours course is a good one, and quite challenging. It's half coursework, and half research. 

My research is going really well - I am lucky enough to be affiliated with a very respected industrial organisation, and my research falls under their umbrella. My group there is building a really exciting piece of infrastructure, which will be significant for our field for decades to come. I'm the only student in the group, and I've had the amazing chance to do some literally world-first tests with all the awesome new equipment. Even more amazingly, things have worked, and we have great results!

I love the work, and I would love to continue it at the PhD level. My group's also indicated that they are extremely keen to keep me -in my boss' words, 'if you want to stay, we'll make it happen'. However, since they're not a degree-granting institution, I need to be enrolled in a PhD program at a university, and strike up a co-supervision arrangement.

However, while my research has gone well this year, my coursework grades have not been so good (straight 'Pass' grades last semester). It's been a rough year - after frequent panic attacks, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety early in the year and placed on medication. This helped a little, but I still struggled, and my grades reflected it. I've recently been reassessed, and changed to a stronger, medication, and am feeling better.

However, my grades remain, and I have added a few poor assignment marks so far this semester, although I am hoping to do better from now on. At this stage, Class One honours is out of my grasp. Realistically, even an Upper Class Two honours might not happen. 

Otherwise, though I say it myself, I'm a pretty good PhD candidate. I have an excellent, even outstanding, research background for an Honours student - a variety of research projects on a range of topics, with some very respected researchers. A few well-known names are happy to act as referees for me.

I've received a number of scholarships, grants, commendations, etc. I've developed software for a range of applications in a number of languages, have good communication and writing skills (my BA is in journalism), and am a friendly, polite, confident person. I've not published before, but we are working on a paper based on my honours research, on which I will be first author. Perhaps most importantly, my bosses are gunning to keep me, and have offered to put in good words for me with their contacts wherever I am applying. 


So, after that essay, how should I approach my PhD scholarship applications? Is there any way I can avoid my low GPA automatically striking me out of consideration?

I have doctor's certificates stating that I have ongoing medical issues, which have affected my study this year, without stating specifically what they are. Would it be worth including a note to this effect, along with a doctor's certificate, in applications? 

I feel that would be an unusual step, so I wanted to float it here first. Could it count in my favour vis-a-vis my GPA? Or would  it simply get my application funny looks? Or worse, make me seem some sort of hypochondriac/special snowflake/chronically ill individual, too unreliable to make a good prospect?

At the moment I'm half a master thesis away from becoming a Msc in mathematics, with a specialty in probability theory &amp; statistics.

[deleted],,2014-08-24 21:43:32,2eh4b2,5,"I'm attending a top-50 private school in my last semester of senior year. I was homeschooled prior to attending college (it was a crippling and devastating experience) and as such I wasn't able to adjust socially for the first two years. The school itself is also sort of a refuge for students with low functioning to midrange Aspergers syndrome, so the social situation itself is incredibly frustrating. I'm trapped without any kind of support network, knowing that I'll be spending a long time trying to recover the skills needed to acculturate myself into mainstream society, network, and gain an advantage in job interviews.

My GPA is at 2.98 as a PoliSci major, due to my general directionlessness and immaturity freshman year, poor advising, and my shock regarding the school's climate, leading to severe depression. The head of my department informed me that PolSci doesn't have the course offerings required to matriculate into most graduate programs because of poor funding, and my own experience with an internship course was underwhelming - we're paying 30K per year and most internships people do in my department are for local politics/canvassing jobs! The only exceptions are for people who can afford to go abroad. If I had known this beforehand, I never would have declared.

I'm considering a switch to a mathematics major (which I was very good at back in high school, was a Mathlete...) because, let's face it, I'll be tending bar until a second-rate graduate program accepts me if I continue on the path I'm on. The 30K I'd be paying for my last semester is worth two years of in-state tuition when you factor in financial aid, so I'm strongly considering taking a semester off to work on my personal issues and then applying to the state school + aid while I'm still enrolled at my previous school's degree program (second BA means no aid). I don't think my school is worth the egregious amount of money any longer, but I'm looking at lost time. FYI I'm turning 24 in December, and I'm 30K in the hole.

I would like any advice you can offer me and please be candid.

My situation is rather complicated so I'll do my best to be as succinct as possible:

* I'm about to finish my undergraduate degree and wish to pursue my studies in the UK, specifically in Oxford or Cambridge (I do have other universities in mind namely Durham, Edinburgh and Aberystwyth, but the two big names are the main ones. Also I'll have no familial support if I apply anywhere else).
* I meet enough of the requirements and expectations to justify my application to names above. 
* Insofar as one can be aware of just how high one's aspirations are, I am aware of how high my aspirations are.

However:

I have depression due partly to the fact that I have been brought up in an environment where everything I work on in an academic setting (which I have only recently stopped associating with bullying and blind teachers), no matter how trivial, has been framed as the single exercise/essay/exam on which my entire life hangs, with little to no support of any kind and near-constant antagonism from my dominant parent literally for as long as I can remember. There are other factors as well, but they are less immediately relevant to my query. 

The stresses brought on by this mind-set have resulted in me being sick of nearly any form of work I have to undertake. It is still present, though lessened somewhat in my chosen field of study, but comes at me in full force outside of it (mainly because I have to work harder to accomplish the set tasks).

Assuming I get in, I have about nine months between graduating and beginning my Master's. Priority will be to try and get the help which has up until now been denied me, but there is no guarantee I will be able to for an adequate amount of time. 

To those of you with depression who have gone to/are in similarly intensive programmes: How accommodating were they? Were you able to cope and do well?

Right now I am less concerned with whether or not I have a chance of getting in and a lot more worried about how things will be if I do.

It’s very late where I am, so I’m going to leave this up and check it and respond to any comments when I get up.

Hi, I'm a 20 year old female and I've just finished a 3-year Bachelor's degree in Biology from a science uni in London. I've been accepted to a 3-year funded PhD programme at Cambridge University in the life sciences/medicine under a supervisor who is very eager, hands-on and one of the most engaged professors I have ever met. It is clear that he is an amazing supervisor, and I consider myself very fortunate to have landed in his very capable hands. However, I can't help but feel extremely insecure, and was wondering whether these are normal things to feel upon embarking on a PhD (without a prior Master's qualification). I have a history of anxiety and depression, and have struggled with similar feelings before, so it is difficult for me to disentangle ""normal"" feelings of fear/excitement from worrisome feelings that may be indicative of a potential red light. Here are the main things I'm feeling/thinking:

1. I feel very much ""fraudulent."" In saying this, I don't mean that I've faked anything on my CV/resume, since I have earnestly performed all lab techniques listed (albeit some only once or twice). My lab project is not based on these techniques, but I feel as though my supervisor is grossly overestimating my degree of expertise in what is supposed to be my comfort zone - molecular biology. I know that grasping new techniques does not take long and that these are feelings every member has prior to joining a lab, but I am scared that my supervisor's expectations will be completely shattered.

2. I'm not sure to what degree my diligence can offset the paucity in expertise. I am a very hard worker, and once I get into a project, I find it easy to become very therein immersed. However, the PhD is in a completely new field that is very much medical, as opposed to my previous lab experiences, which were focused more on the mechanisms of pathogenesis, rather than their outcomes and management. I'm not sure every PhD student has an adjustment period where they must wade through instructional materials and mountains of recent literature to accustom themselves to the jargon and leading themes in their field, or whether I am in way over my head. 

I hope that you will be able to shed some light on whether these are normal insecurities for a prospective PhD student to have, or whether the reservations raise significant concern. Thanks in advance :)

HumanDrinkingTea,t2_o4xhq,2015-07-22 03:22:44,3e5lun,4,"I'm a recent college grad in a performing arts field. Over the past few years I've grown increasingly interested in the idea of research, and I have a particular interest in the field of neuroscience. By the time I realized this I had already committed so much time and energy into my chosen major that I felt it necessary that I follow through on completing the degree.

Here's the deal: Now that I've graduated, I realize that all I really want to do is go back to school. But there are problems. The last time I took a biology class was about 10 years ago. I had time for a free elective at the end of my degree program, so I chose to take a statistics course. Unfortunately I suffered from Major Depression and anxiety, and found that my mental health was so bad that I was terrified of going to classes by the end and so it was more or less as if I had dropped off of the face of the earth (I am learning how to deal  with these problems via therapy and whatnot, but the F's on my transcript remain). I failed several classes, including statistics, and I fear that ruins my chances of anyone taking me seriously. To make matters worse, I'm pretty sure that my statistics professor along with me other professors would have given me a resounding recommendation up until the last 3 weeks of that semester. 

So... I have bad grades and an undergrad degree in a completely unrelated field to the one I'm interested in studying. How do I find a way to 1) Educate myself in the field that I am interested in, 2) Involve myself in research situations so that I know that it is the right field for me, and 3) Convince potential colleges that I am up to the challenge?

Here's what I've thought of so far: Do as much learning as I can on my own. Figure out relevant credits needed and take them at a community college. Ask people in the field what it's like working in the field and what they look for in those interested in getting into the field (but how do I find people?)

Whatever route I take, I know that it will take a lot of time and sacrifice. I really like the idea of volunteering in a lab, but is this even possible when one is not currently enrolled in a program? All the opportunities seem to be for current undergrads. I feel that such a volunteer experience might give me a good idea as to whether or not this is really a route I want to take.

Am I crazy for thinking I can change fields and become a research scientist when I already have an unrelated Bachelors degree, no experience, and questionable grades? I mean, I'm not made of money, so that's going to be a hurdle as well.

On the flip side, I am passionate about learning, I am a very good student and a quick learner when I am not affected by mental health issues, and I could probably get one or several professors to vouch that I have a strong potential for success in academia. 

So, r/AskAcademia, how do I make this happen?

2. quit and look for another PhD right away.
3. quit and find some other occupation for 1-2 years, then find another PhD.

Even more so, if you manage to spare counsel or advice.

## Wall of text

I'm going to **highlight** what I think my mistakes have been during the whole
process, as an indication of my current state-of-mind.

For those who don't know, a PhD in Germany has much less structure than in
other countries (particularly compared to the US). For all intents and
purposes, I'm really just a Research Engineer who is employed by the lab
to publish, collaborate on EU projects, and help with teaching. There are no
courses to take and no intermediate milestones to achieve. I'm not even
technically registered as a student yet. Excluding the PhD defense, there is
no-one who particularly cares about my progress except for me and my direct
supervisor.  Expected duration is 3 years, although it is not uncommon to have
it extended to last 4-5 year total.

Before my PhD, I had just graduated both BSc and MSc with honors, had my MSc
thesis published in a conference, and won ""best thesis of the year"" award from
a national society for my field. I had all the confidence a smart young person
in my situation could have. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at university, and
developed very early the will to pursue a career in Academia.  After
graduating, I was offered to stay as a PhD student in the lab where I developed
my MSc thesis, however, I opted to look for opportunities elsewhere. The
university and lab were good (KTH in Sweden), but I still wanted to explore the
world and continue travelling.

I ended up joining a young researcher who was going to be leaving his lab at
one of Germany's most prominent universities in Berlin to become professor at a
less prestigious university in south Germany. By the time I started, the lab
had only existed for 2 months, and I was only the 4th employee. I suppose this
was one of my first mistakes: **it was very naive of me to join a fresh/unknown
lab**. A leap in the dark which at the time I dismissed without much thought.

My experience as a PhD student broke me and destroyed my confidence. I quickly
went from being top of the class, to the guy who somehow can't get anything to
work.  The next three years went as follows.

## Year 1

Since this was the very start, most of the lab's focus was on getting things
started, organizing the first courses, etc..  I was left to find my own path,
and being inexperienced in concrete lab work, **I lacked the methodology** to
get things started right.  I was vaguely involved in an EU project which had
just entered its final year.  As a newcommer at the end of the project, I had
nothing meaningful to contribute.  I was in charge of some data collection (on
the last year of a project, you ask? yeah..) which I didn't really manage to do
because of some difficulty I had developing code for the multiple involved
hardware systems.  Nonetheless, it didn't really matter that I couldn't deliver
significant data.  Basically, I was just there to consume funding.

Towards the end of the year I injured my knee while running down the stairs to
catch a subway train.  It was nothing serious, but it put me down and led me to
stop running, which eventually had an impact on my mental and physical health.

## Year 2

This is the year where things got really bad. I became depressed for about 9
months and gained 20kg. **I did not seek help**, and in all honesty I doubt
anyone noticed. I am out of it now, although I still carry the extra weight
with me.

I enter a new EU project and end up patching up the data-collection from the
previous year. Data quality or quantity is not particularly good, but I do
finally start working on a subject using this data. Methodology is still crap,
since I developed none in the previous year and I am still left to find my own
path, so progress is still incredibly slow.  I manage to squeeze out one
publication near the end of the second year, but I'm not particularly proud of
that work.

I realize I'm failing my PhD, but **never consider quitting as a real
possibility**. I have a mind-block in place which makes the idea outright
absurd.  Also, **I lack the confidence and courage to confront my supervisor
more explicitly about my progress**.

## Year 3

Getting out of the depression, things become better. I end up getting
interested in a related but different subject, and my supervisor supports me
into switching direction.  During the course of the year, my methodology
improves, but **I'm still behind on all sorts of aspects**.

During the summer I convince S, my colleague and friend with whom I've shared
an office since the very start, to work with me on the next publication.  I was
thrilled to finally be collaborating with someone else, and to be part of a
team.  So far we are still a relatively small team, and internal collaboration
is rare. Everyone works on their own projects, and we only know each other's
work superficially. Our supervisor seems to be the only one who has a unified
vision of the lab's work.

We work together for a month and submit but eventually end up withdrawing due
to a bug in the model implementation which spoiled the results.  Right after
the submission, S announces he would be quitting his PhD after a couple of
months.  This was a small blow for me.  He had started just before me, and him
quitting made me question once again my own progress.

## Year 3 + 2 weeks

Last week I realized that I will not be able to make a deadline set by the end
of the month for a conference submission.  Althugh I am starting to find a path
and things have improved since the previous years, I feel like this would be
the umpteenth bump in my unsuccessful path.

I'm fairly confident that if I wanted I could let this slide together with all
the rest, and that I could eventually get another 2 shitty publications during
the course of another year or so, and I could get this PhD. But this is not the
reason why I wanted to work in academia, and I do not want to receive a PhD for
work which I'm not proud of, just because I eventually managed to publish n
papers.

I'm in good terms with my supervisor, he's extremely complacent (which in all
honesty doesn't help me).  The only fault that I can ever imagine laying upon
him is that he seems to restrain himself from giving explicit directions, but I
wouldn't do that; I am well aware that, as a PhD candidate, the onus is on me
to develop my own research.  He is currently away for business, but I will talk
to him about my doubts when he's back.

As things stand, I find myself am now in front of the following decision:

1. grin and bear and extend it (ignoring the fact that I have only published once in 3 years).
2. quit and look for another PhD right away.
3. quit and find some other occupation for 1-2 years, then find another PhD.

Where to begin . . . 

I attended college for two years as a Philosophy and English dual major starting in Fall of 2010 in Tennessee. During that time, due to various familial difficulties; depression, social anxiety, and my inability to realize I suffered from them; and my issues with the university (maybe higher education itself, but I've only attended one school and it seems unfair to judge) I went from fully paid tuition, to my grades dropping drastically resulting in academic probation and eventually dropping out of school having lost nearly all of my intellectual curiosity and gaining debt. 

The only two things I have ever wanted to do with my life are writing and teaching, and they're what I'm good at. Before entering college, I was reading a book a week. By the middle of my first semester, I was already considering dropping out. By the end of my second year, I stopped reading and writing almost completely. I would go to school (skipping some classes), do none of the work, go home, and do practically nothing (even neglecting things I would normally do to unwind, like playing video games) just to de-stress from the events of the day, sleep restlessly, and do it all over again the next day. 

I have never liked school, but have always loved my teachers. I was closest to two of my professors -- both of whom could tell how unhappy I was; told me I wasn't stupid, crazy, or lazy; believed in me; liked my writing and encouraged me to do whatever I had to to continue doing it; shared my criticisms of the University; and gave me the same piece of advice: ""I have no idea how to advise you."" Dropping out seemed like the best idea, despite it just being the less undesirable choice. So I did. 

Today I have more control over my social anxiety than I have ever had, and sometimes feel depressed because I'm *not* in school. My girlfriend, who I can easily see myself with indefinitely, is a law student at an excellent school and has no problem whatsoever with the fact I didn't graduate -- nor does she mind being the primary breadwinner (to the point that she would be okay with me quitting my job later to focus full-time on my writing. I'm a lucky guy.) I had already dropped out when we met, was up front about my academic history and the likelihood I would return -- all of it. She believes in and is fully supportive of me. However, I have some anxiety that one day she will wake up no longer happy, and the thought that I will eventually realize she is only with me to keep me off the streets breaks my heart. I edit my girlfriend's papers, and it's made me miss writing them. We sometimes talk about me going back to school. I am always the one to initiate this conversation and feel no amount of pressure from her. I believe she genuinely will fully support either decision. 

Right now I work full time as a security guard. The pay is shit, but I am free to read and write as I please. I have been working on a novel for about eight years and am happy with where it's going, but these things take time and it is going to take more. I also know I will learn things in college that I would never learn outside of it, and those things are likely to help my writing.

I was miserable in college. I'm miserable out of it. I want to believe that my college experience was terrible because of the school went to. I want to believe there is a school where I will be happy. In five months I will be 25. The longer I wait to return to University, the more difficult it will be and the more disconnected from the other students I will feel. I attended a large, easy-to-get-into University. Should I return, I would like to attend a small Liberal Arts school. One professor wanted me to go to Stanford (his alma mater) and was willing to write me a Letter of Recommendation, but we both knew I would never get in no matter what he said. That brings me to the crux of my problem.

I don't know if I should go back, where I would go, how I would get in, how I would pay for it, whether I'd just be miserable again and come out with nothing but more debt to show for it, or who to talk to for help. A few hours ago I asked for information from Sewanee's Philosophy department and sent an email to someone involved with transfer applicants, but the University is closed until next month and I don't know if they'll even entertain the possibility of accepting me.

I'm 21, currently working full time as a welder (night shift sucks) saving money and paying off any debts I have (I'll be out of debt completely within 3 months). I tried going to decently large university in my hometown (13,000 students) twice after graduating high school. Started in fall of '09 as a Computer Science major, dropped out at semester due to struggles with depression, started again in fall of '10, this time dropping out at semester again because I figured out that the school was simply a bad fit for me.

So for the last year I've been working full time, living on my own, and until 3 months ago, barely scraping by. I've done a lot of soul searching in the years since I graduated high school and being on my own and working has let me truly evaluate myself. 

I'm an intelligent person, although I have been wasting my talents on video games for a long time, something I feel many in my generation are apt to do. But I've had enough of it. My mind aches for challenges that simply playing games cannot satisfy anymore. Also, I can't live with myself knowing that I could be contributing to science and humanity if I just had more education. 

I have begun warming up by brain for learning in the last few months by starting to read again (something I did a lot when I was younger but dwindled during high school), brushing up on math (using Khan Academy; currently working on pre calc exercises), and using reddit as a means to find interesting things to learn about such as robotics, space, technology and the like. I'd like to go to school for robotics of some sort, as I like to work with my hands building things, but also enjoy programming and designing things. 

My question is, how do I go about getting back into school? My transcript is dismal at best due to dropping out twice. I assume any financing would be primarily out of pocket. I would like to get back into school sometime in the next 3 or 4 years, though obviously, the sooner the better. Where do I start?

My years in High School overall haven't been the most outstanding performance. 9th grade I got almost straight As and my life just went downhill from there. During my 10th grade year I just started losing interest in everything I liked in school which pulled my grades down to Bs and Cs.

* Blank maps of Europe for her to fill in for various time periods
* The movie *Metropolis* (assuming I can find it)
* Discussions about *Brave New World*, which she has already read
* *Little Man, What Now?* by Hans Fallada

* The Frontline documentary *Memory of the Camps*

[deleted],,2014-03-28 00:20:32,21jwz9,4,"Hey everyone, 

I guess I'll get the missing context out of the way first. 

I hold an AA from a Florida state college, with a GPA of 3.4. And at the moment I'm applying to a few public universities in Florida (UF, FSU, UF, and USF -- all for a BA in English). 

However, I'm currently a recent transfer (as of fall 2013) to a certain university in the North Dakota due to a series of poor life circumstances and decisions which were not entirely in my control. 

I moved up here to get away from my family and in an attempt to get out of a terrible rut that had begun to sink my GPA (more details on this later). I was going on 21, already taking a year off of college after getting my A.A. in order to figure out what I wanted to do with my life before investing another two years, and a fair amount of money, into school. Before taking the year off, I had nearly failed all of my classes in my final semester(s) -- skipping classes out of depression, broken sleep schedule, various forms of self harm, etc. I wasn't in the best shape mentally by the end of my first two years, and there's a very obvious decline in my grades on my transcript.

So, as mentioned, I took a year off in order to just get myself together. I did enroll in some more (practical training) community college classes just to try to stay busy the following fall after my graduation, but that went as well as you would expect. I got a job in the latter half of the year and applied for UCF. 

I applied, but I was never accepted or denied. My application was stuck in bureaucratic hell; I would call the admissions department at least once a week, and would almost always receive some excuse as to why no decision on my application had been made yet, months after applying. This happened to a few people I knew during that application period, too. 

I had a friend who had moved up here, ND, for work, and offered me a place to stay and go to school, mentioning that maybe getting out of my parents' place would be good for my mental health. So, I took the offer, applied, and got accepted to the school here within three weeks. I was desperate to get out and finally get back into school after the shitshow that was UCF's admissions department. 

So, after a summer of packing up and moving out, I arrived up here. Got a job within two weeks, no problem. Ends up moving here wasn't a great idea, the job I had basically made full-time classes near-impossible, though that didn't stop me from trying, and my grades from that semester show for it. I quit the job for unrelated reasons a few months ago. My grades here have risen, but are not that much better, since moving up here really hasn't done much to solve my current mental health situation. If anything it's worsened it. I've been very reluctant to go get professional health, so this may be almost entirely my fault to begin with.

Also, the tuition is too expensive for me, and I have a lot of familial pressure to move back home rather than stay up here (at the moment I am, shamefully, still relying on some support from my family, and can understand, and even agree with, them wanting me closer to home). 

And here we are now. After all of this, I just want to forget this year existed, and re-apply elsewhere with my old state college GPA, which was at least respectable, so I can just finish already. I should've graduated this year, but at this rate it will be another two years till graduation due to this long chain of circumstances.

So, I'm not sure what to do regarding my applications. Should I include this horrible record and include what was written here as an explanation, or submit the better looking and cherry-picked transcript for my applications (if I can even do that at all)? 

For those who have actually taken the time to read all of this, thanks for any advice you can offer. ",AskAcademia,"Considering not including my current in school in my transfer application and other advice (there's a lot of context to consider, hard to sum up in a title)."
AllBoutDatSzechuan,t2_17bkuy,2017-04-23 02:17:47,66zw6x,4,"This is probably a really dumb, and really hopeless question. So a little about me. I'm 23, still in college. Story behind that being, I started off in CC because my folks couldn't pay for normal university. But I got good grades and transferred into a decent college as a CS major. Unfortunately my mom didn't want me moving out at 19 (I'm a girl, if the context helps). I was crushed. I fell into a major depression. Kinda dropped off the map for a while.

I tried taking a few more CC courses but my heart wasn't in it and my GPA dropped. Not much, but it took a hit. So now, I'm on my own and got accepted into a business administration program. Which works since I do run my own business. But part of me still sees this as my opportunity to follow my dreams and do something science related.

Unfortunately, I'm a little behind on math. I just finished trig. I've also never been super great at math but I'm so frigging willing to learn. Currently I'm contemplating whether to minor in biology or physics. I know the two are night and day, but I love both fields. I figure it goes two ways. If I minor in bio, I would try and pursue a masters in biotech. With physics, I know it's a little more difficult. But if I minor in physics, I want to go the astrophysics/astronomy route. 

Problem is, I'm not even sure any program would accept me with just a minor in either, especially with ZERO research under my belt. I know I really screwed up but I want to study a science. A business degree was my way into ""real"" college but it isn't satisfying my curiosity. 

Is it even worth it to minor in any of those? Will they lead anywhere at this point? Is it really too late?

WiiPu,t2_jkbci,2014-11-24 05:22:05,2n8jiw,4,"I'm a junior in college and I got a position as an undergraduate volunteer research assistant last June. When the professor and I were discussing expectations for my involvement, we decided that the minimum amount of involvement would be ~40hrs/week in the summer and ~13 hrs/week for the fall semester. In the summer I mostly assisted my grad student w/ various tasks, and at the start of the fall semester I got my own project to work on. Well, it's the middle of the fall semester and I think I want to quit after the semester ends. No one in my research group has any idea; they think I want to work in the lab until I graduate (though I have never expressed such sentiments).

However, I learned I'm not very passionate about research and the possibility of grad school, and I haven't been able to balance schoolwork and lab work very effectively (along with bouts of depression/suicidal thoughts). The nature of the work involves setting aside large amounts of time (sometimes up to 7hrs of active work) to complete experiments, and I feel this is very difficult to do with a challenging course load. These facts may be just excuses, though. I'm satisfied with the amount of time I put into the lab during the summer, but I haven't put in near the amount of time that was expected during the fall (~6-8 hrs/week as opposed to 13hrs/week). I do make sure to communicate with my grad student my time difficulties.

My guilt lies in the facts that I:

 1) haven't made any real progress on my project. That is, I have practically nothing to show after a semester's worth of work. It seems that every week during group meetings when we discuss updates in our research I have nothing to present. Every goddamn week, and it's my fault. I know. This ties into my not putting in the hours to get experiments done.

2) The grad student who I work with has invested an incredible amount of time in helping me learn about techniques and concepts about the research, and I haven't contributed anything close to justify the level of support I've received. My leaving the group would be a lost investment when he was expecting me to stay and possibly publish results.

3) I recently received an internship offer at a company for the following summer, and I just told my professor the exciting news. However, I feel that telling him now about want to quit might make him feel used as a means to an end and bad feelings may be had. Though I do value his being one of my references, my sentiments about the group existed long prior to the news about the internship.

The question is, do I continue paying my dues into the next semester, or should I tell my professor my feelings, and what would be the most gracious way to do so? I love being around the grad students and the professor as they are great people and have contributed a lot to my personal development, but I just don't want to do the research anymore.

I don't know, any words of advice would be greatly appreciated. It just made me feel a little better to write this down. Thanks for reading.",AskAcademia,Guilt over wanting to quit undergraduate research position

General Chemistry
Mechanical Physics
Integral Calculus
Discrete Math
Weight Lifting (I honestly don't think that any supplemental reading will help me here. &lt;/humor&gt;)

So, because I burned so badly and pulled myself from a 3.5 to a 2.9 over the last two semesters, I need some help pulling that back up while I'm still in the middle of an intense engineering program.  I'm most interested in supplemental reading for chemistry and physics - tutorials etc. and books (I have some money to get a book or two) - because I haven't taken chemistry in six years and don't remember a damn thing, and I've never taken a proper physics course.

For discrete math, I have copies of How to Prove It (forgot the author) and Schaum's Outline, which were the required material when I crashed, burned, and utterly failed the class because I decided to take it under the university's most demanding professor (sucks to be me, but I still learned a hell of a lot).  For calculus, I have [The Manga Guide to Calculus](http://nostarch.com/mg_calculus.htm), which while basic did help me my first third-around with calc I (I passed it with an A first time, that didn't transfer, second time I missed a mid term thanks to a terrible car accident, and third time I managed to pass.  yay!)  So I'm open to suggestions for those as well.

Other things I'm doing on the side are following [this tutorial about electronics](http://electronicstheory.com/COURSES/ELECTRONICS/e101-6.htm) which seems to have some chemistry involved, but that's mostly because I'm curious.

**tl;dr:**  Any suggestions for supplemental reading that is entertaining and in ""layman's terms"" for basic chemistry and mechanical physics?

[edit] So I did want to note about why the crash in GPA:  basically, I'm having a really shitty time.  Life happened - had a major illness last fall that caused me to miss nearly a month of school, the following semester my car got hit by someone running a stop sign, and then this semester I'm going through a divorce, money issues, and the whole nine yards.  So I'm not bad at math (it's my strong point, other than a touch of dyscalcula (sp?)), and the depression that comes with seeing a nearly perfect GPA go down the shitter.

However, that one week has set me behind a lot more than I expected. I feel completely lost when I go to class and at this point I'm just winging it.

[deleted],,2011-10-22 02:15:52,lkmge,4,"This is going to seem a bit long, there's a tl;dr version at the end if you can't bear reading this. Anyways, I've been attending university in Canada for the past three years. My first year I was in biochemistry; after battling extreme illness due to the onset of Celiac disease and a harsh breakup, my marks went to crap and I was forced to drop out or change programs. (I've also never failed anything in my life. Was hard to swallow.)

Second year I tried to commit suicide twice and was diagnosed with bipolar I during the following summer. My marks were fairly good, and I was accepted into Honors Psychology. The following year was alright, but as I was just beginning medication regimens and really a lot of issues regarding my diagnosis including extreme depression, my marks weren't great. I was put on conditional standing.

Then I took statistics and, where the class average was only about 60%, I got 55%. My average flatlined in my psychology courses and I was dropped into a 3-year general degree.

I'm now at the point where I want to give up. I'm in my 'third' year of my program, my marks are up, I'm on medication, I'm getting research experience, but I've realized it'll all be for nothing: I can't possibly get back into Honors. I would need to get over 88% in at least 5 psychology courses to make the 75% cutoff.

Without honors, I can't take advanced stats, take seminars or do a thesis. Without those, I'm reasonably positive no grad school in the country would take me. This SUCKS because the schools themselves say they look at your last 2 years of performance. If this year and next year are spectacular, it won't matter. I won't have stats or the 'required experience' because I CAN'T.

So what the hell am I supposed to do? I don't think I can talk my way out of my position, but I really, desperately wanted to get at least my Master's. If I can't do that, I feel like a failure. I don't even think I could beg my way into at least having the option of taking those courses without being in the 'honors' reserve portion because no one sympathizes and I hate making excuses for my poor performance.

My other possibilities are getting my B.Ed (worthless in Ontario, no jobs, would have to move) or my ECE (lots of jobs, make no money). I'm specializing in child development, if anyone finds that relevant. The practical part of me is willing to do any job that will make me more than $30,000 a year. The passionate part of me wants to get my PhD and go into developmental research or clinical counseling so bad it hurts.

tl;dr: I'm academically screwed out of getting my PhD. What else can I do to help kids with a B.A. in General Psychology that'll actually pay the bills? (Or better, how can I prove to an admissions board that I AM Ph.D material, despite not having completed a thesis?)

ResurrectedFailure,t2_cq1lw,2013-08-12 02:59:27,1k6leq,3,"I'm not really looking to brag, but I may have screwed up my transcript more than anyone you've ever met. Well, hopefully not, but I wouldn't be surprised. It was, as I learned, a side-effect of a seasonal form of depression, which I now have 100% under control.

In the interests of anonymity, I'm going to be fairly vague, but I'm going to try to give the best answers that I can to any questions.

 - I began my college career in the 90's at arts trade school, where I studied for a year and experienced great success. Circumstances in my life were altered, and I left that school to live home again. I started the following semester, but withdrew before the deadline. This was the first 13 credits that I attempted to begin and failed to complete.

 - Five years later (in the 2000s), I returned to school and achieved 3 relatively solid semesters (the third semester, I withdrew from one class and failed another course). Everything else was probably a B average. At this point, I maintained my initial major.

 - The next semester, I experienced a few major life changes (the loss of a fiance, my parents moved across the country, and a few other things), and I withdrew from courses again (another 13 credits that I didn't complete (though I withdrew before failure)).

 - The following summer, I took 2 courses and maintained a B average. All seemed to be going back in the right direction.

 - The following fall, I had lost track of my major and withdrew from school for the third time (another 19 credits withdrawn). I found that my depression was basically keeping me from going anywhere other than a dead-end job and laying at home.

 - I reenrolled for the next semester, was still incapable of getting through it, but didn't even have the strength to face going in to withdraw from classes again. I had 18 failed credits.

 - The next semester, I found myself passing 3 of my 5 classes. I would have completely given up if I hadn't had a professor who inspired me. Of course, this was in a course completely irrelevant to any major I was looking for, but I had a great time. I got an A in her class.

 - Two more consecutive failing semesters where I added another 27 credits to my failing roster.

That's a total of 3.5 failing semesters, 3 withdrawn semesters. I am not going to go into any depth with respect to my depression, but I will now bring you up to speed with where I am currently:

 - I have changed majors from fine arts to a STEM subject. I have taken 52 credits at a community college and have a 3.75 GPA. I haven't had depressive issues for *years*, partly due to the fact that I moved to an area where I am no longer subject to my seasonal depression, and partly due to other factors that I've experienced in treatment.

 - I have a great reputation among my professors, and was actually hired by one of them to work as a lab assistant.

 - I am going to a state college, and have a fair number of friends who also go to this school. I am in my 30's now. 

I know that I'm pretty much never going to land a sweet MIT position in grad school. I am also pretty certain that I'm going to have this brought up every time I apply for anything where my transcript will come up. That said, I have been going on faith that I can redeem my incredibly shitty history and have a career in my science. I still have almost 3 years of course work to do before I graduate. I plan on taking either 3 or 4 courses at a time, only in the area of my major, but it took me a few courses to get my math and science prerequisites up to Freshman college level.

I'm accepted into my state college. I will be able to graduate with a Bachelor's degree. I ought to be able to get a job beyond college with my major and recommendations. I am curious, however, to know whether my atrocious history will effectively prevent me from going to grad school to continue my education in my subject, or if I should be able to overcome the obstacle of my past by the virtue of my more recent history.

Mind you, I've got a few more courses to go through in order to get to that point, and I'm going to get my Bachelor's in my subject regardless of what the responses are, but I want to have an understanding of the reality of my situation. Is the goal of continuing to the Master's and PhD level a pipe dream for me? 

Oh, and I've currently got about 140 college credits (and an Associate's degree to show for it).

**TL;DR:** Can someone who has failed/withdrawn from 6 full semesters of college in his youth be able to gain the respect of the academic community a decade later, after a number of years of hard work, dedication, and success, or will his background as the king of fuck-ups prevent him from being able to get into grad school?",AskAcademia,"I screwed up royally years ago, but multiple times.

Last year, the lead author for one of my papers lied to me about authorship in our paper right as she was submitting our camera-ready version of our paper. I pushed no further because I wanted to trust her. At our conference, however, I realized that the reasons she cited earlier where completely non-existent: she just straight up lied to keep her name at the top of the paper. Plus, she didn't tell me at all about presentations she was having about our work, before completely botching them and completely embarrassing us all in front of our lab's professors. I told my PI about it and later he said he had 'the talk' with her on the subject.

I spoke to a few other professors around our campus about this and they all said the same thing about the situation: you're right to be angry about it, this was unethical, etc. One even said this issue is grounds to no longer allow this person to work in our lab.

Now, I'm not generally a vindictive person but I feel like my colleague 'got away' with a huge lie. It's bothered me so much that she's been trusted with more and more impactful and high-profile work by our PI. While, at the same time, I can't even step into our lab without feeling an unbelievable amount of anxiety. I've also developed a serious depression (and the related issues) stemming from this situation. It just feels completely wrong that we're both on two completely different sides of this coin.

I feel like my PI doesn't respect me or my contributions to our paper. I feel like he has a clear favoritism towards the colleague that lied to me. And, the very environment of the lab triggers me every time I go there, even months after all this went down. However, I absolutely love the work we do, it's what I've searched for a long time.

disorderedfiction,t2_88shv5su,2020-11-15 23:09:13,juvnh5,3,"I’m terrified of grad school and having a thesis advisor because that relationship is even more intense. I’m only an undergrad right now and already feel a too-intense bond with many of my professors. 

It’s gotten to the point that I’m afraid to take any  classes I am passionate about if they are taught by a male professor because I know I will inevitably “fall in love” with them, no matter how old or unattractive they seem to me at first. Even a female professor. It doesn’t matter. I think I know why this happens, and my professors really are usually wonderful teachers (I go to a small, prestigious liberal arts college). I’m passionate about learning and the subjects they teach and I don’t feel very supported by my parents. I can see how it is used as defense against loneliness and depression, and how mania obviously plays into it. But it doesn’t do much to stop the feelings, which I’ll never act on but which are begin to crush me. I think they began in a pure and innocent and even beautiful way so I’m reluctant to completely ignore them, or cast them aside. How does something so innocent as genuine admiration for a teacher turn into something so dark and painful as obsession?

This current infatuation started three and a half years ago and I’m still deep in it. I haven’t seen him in over a year (I took a leave of absence for mental health reasons) and I’m crying over it. Quarantine may be making it worse. I feel a lesser version of this toward nearly alI of my male professors and I know even if I get over this one it could easily happen again. 

At first, with my current infatuation, who is 30 years older than me and married (and also my professor and advisor) I didn’t even I was becoming infatuated at first. I just admired him and enjoyed listening to him. A lot. He was so unlike anyone I’d ever met and his enthusiasm for literature (which I’m also very enthusiastic about, as an English major) just lit up the room. It also lit a fire in my soul. It’s hard to explain but it really did. It energized me and I still feel warm and fuzzy all over just thinking about it. It’s not lust I swear (he is almost 60 and balding, though still cute and well dressed!). It had almost nothing to do with sex at first and everything to do with his energy, his quirkiness, his charm, and mostly, the way his brain worked. The things coming out of his mouth were unlike anything I’d ever heard before. He could also tease out the complicated twistings of my own mind and quickly grasp and articulate exactly what I was trying to say, or what I was thinking, in a way no else had been able to do before. It made me feel less alone in my thoughts. I could babble in my way, and when most people furrowed their brow or ignored me, he’d get excited and reflect back to me exactly what I was trying to say. I remember feeling once, after a discussion in office hours, that I’d had a real conversation, a tête-à-tête, a meeting of minds, for the first time in my life. The thick fog of bias and projection that normally separates people from really seeing each other seemed to have been lifted, temporarily, or perhaps our individual projections just happened to, in that moment, perfectly align with reality, so that it felt like there was no barrier to communication. It was a strange and exhilarating conversation, about the book we were discussing in class, but also about life and ourselves, and our thoughts seemed to be flowing back effortlessly though we were interrupting each other and speaking in choppy, half sentences and metaphors and silences. Yet there was an understanding of so much, with so few words, as if whole novels worth of ideas and feelings were being passed between us effortlessly. I will never know if he felt the same. Likely, not, but perhaps a bit. He told me during that conversation that it was like “finding a glass of water in a desert.” I still don’t know what the it was exactly referring to (though in that moment it made perfect sense to me). That’s exactly how I felt about that conversation. 

Even just writing this now my heart is racing. Suddenly, I didn’t have to be alone in my thoughts anymore, he tolerated and understood my all the paradoxical things  swarming in my head, all the cognitive dissonance, all the conflicted feelings. He was smart and fascinating and I wanted to learn everything I could from him. I worked hard to impress him and to show him how much I was learning from him. And it worked. But when he started praising and encouraging me and treating me a little bit “special” it felt so good I became even more attached. But by that time he was already my advisor and I’d taken multiple classes with him and “fallen in love” with his field of study. Long story short my feelings for him grew and grew over the next three years into something no longer appropriate for a student teacher relationship, or perhaps any relationship. Even my completely platonic feelings of admiration and excitement became too intense and almost creepy and unsettling to others. So I had to, and still have to, constantly hold back not just my inappropriate longings for emotional intimacy, affection and mutuality, but I have to constantly hold back and restrain myself from expressing all of the normally good and “appropriate” feelings overflowing in my heart, like gratitude, admiration, affection, eagerness to learn and, yes, Iove, because somehow in me, all those good things have become so intense that they turn bad. People find it unsettling. The difficulty of keeping it all inside is perhaps even more painful and exhausting than the inevitable lack of reciprocity or impossibility of mutuality (he is my professor, advisor, married with children, and over 30 years older than me), though that is quite painful too, in it’s own way. I know that it can never be and I have no hope for a relationship yet I still find myself enamored and thinking of him and his brain and his family and wondering who he is, time and time again, four years after first meeting him. Last night I cried for hours after thinking about him. I’m not quite sure what exactly I was crying over except how exhausted I was, and how intensely I felt about him. I don’t even want to be in a relationship with him. I just love him. 

I thought infatuation was only supposed to last 6 months, especially when you aren’t in a relationship with them? What is going on? 

I feel as though crushes are something you are supposed to enjoy, but why can’t I just enjoy this one? I am afraid to even allow myself admire anyone anymore lest it turn into this. Even when my professor is supportive and encouraging and reciprocates as much as they possibly can within the limits of propriety, why can’t I just be grateful and enjoy the good feelings? I don’t even know why I feel so much pain around this anymore it doesn’t make sense. It’s like it’s triggered some deep, primordial longing that can never be satisfied by any mortal. I want to accept it, and move on, and I often just sit with the pain and meditate or even try to distract myself but it’s not going away. Is this what life is supposed to be like? Will it ever go away?

The scary truth is that I KNOW this will happen again. It’s never been quite this painful or long lasting before (partly because this time I perceived, perhaps incorrectly, some signs in the beginning that he also felt something toward me), but it has happened with female as well as male teachers since 10th grade. 4 total, one at a time, usually lasting over a year. With every new object of fixation however, it seems to be  becoming more and more painful, and less and less pleasurable. 

What should I do?",AskAcademia,I keep becoming infatuated with my professors to the point that it is painful. How do you manage this? My passion for the subject inevitably bleeds into the relationship.

I’m in my last semester of my undergrad in Bioinformatics and Computer Science, and I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for about 7 years now. I know that this is a common thing in the sciences, so it’s safe to assume that someone out there in my field has been in the same boat. 

I’m finding it so hard to keep going. I had a plan when I first got accepted into my programs, I was going to get published by 20 and get accepted into a master’s program and T.A. to cover my tuition. But an inability to hold down 2 part time jobs and research while remaining a full time student pursuing 2 degrees, along with supporting my family and the occurrence of a personal trauma led to everything toppling down this time last year. My GPA plummeted, I couldn’t complete my research project, and I lost my jobs. Now I just want to graduate and end strong and obtain a job in industry. I keep trying to recover, I had an internship over the summer that went really well, and that was great, but the fall semester did not go the way I needed it to, and I’m recognizing the same patterns for this semester. I’ve so many late assignments, and I feel anxiety over the assignments that I haven’t finished every time I start on a different one, and I don’t know how to be productive anymore. I had started taking medication for anxiety last September, but it severely limits my ability to read, which sounds weird but I’ve found it can take about 3 times as it normally would to process the information, which obviously hinders my ability to do the work that necessitates the medication.

I guess I’m just looking for someone to say that they went through something similar, maybe supply an uplifting story and some strategies to get on track.

__Hypnotic__,,2018-06-05 18:31:23,8ot9ez,3,"So, I'm in a tricky situation. My parents pay for my college. Last fall, I attended a major university but failed ALL my classes due to some shitty situations and depression. I then transferred to a COMMUNITY college in the same area the following spring semester, in hopes to pursue my AA and transferring instead of starting out with a 0.0 GPA at a major university. I got 3 B's and 1 A that semester.

It is now summer and I am taking 3 courses. Two of them, I am very behind in and have calculated that there is only a possibility for me to make a high C or low B (assuming I make straight 100's on everything now, which isn't likely), and my father has told me ""From now on out you need to get straight A's""

I have no doubt I'm capable of succeeding in these courses, I'm just so far behind in the workload it's ridiculous. Shoulda just kept up with it instead of telling myself I'll do it later, it's summer.

Normally I am a huge advocate for disclosing issues to your supervisor, and believe in honesty and transparency. However, in this situation I'm not sure what to do because of the nature of my relationship with my PI, and I could use some advice.

I'm a postdoc starting my third year in the lab. This is my second postdoc. For the last several years I've been slowly coming to the conclusion that research isn't for me. I would like to remain in science but I really miss helping people and having an impact, so I'm leaning toward leaving this job when I can and pursuing something in the science education/communication/policy realm. 

In the last 10-12 months, I have really sunk into a deep depression that was triggered by a traumatizing faculty interview back when I thought academia was for me. It went alright but the leadup and prep for it nearly killed me, and really got me thinking whether academia is for me. It triggered my (at the time undiagnosed) depression to come on hard, and I finally after 20+ years of feeling this way, finally went to see my doctor, got diagnosed, and started taking medication. I have been trying different meds and going to therapy, and it has been a daily struggle. I've been having an increasing number of really bad days, and lately it has started to interfere with my ability to do my job.

Even without depression, I really hate this job. My PI is not a good person, he is a horrible mentor, and while he seems ok on the surface, his actions reveal that he is selfish, cruel, and manipulative toward his trainees. Every single person has left his lab with a fight/argument/issue. Obviously I am planning on leaving this job, but I have teaching commitments next year and I know my PI will make it difficult for me to leave (he holds papers hostage, he guilts people into staying, he punishes you for leaving ""early"" by piling on as much work as possible until you leave, etc). It's important to note that he tends to take out his frustrations in his reference letters, and wouldn't hesitate to write something to the effect that I left projects ""unfinished"" if I decided to hit the eject button now or in the next 6-12 months. I have not published yet in this lab due to the difficulty of my projects.

To make matters worse, my depression is making it difficult for me to find any reason to care about this job anymore. I loathe coming to work, I don't see the point of my work, I know I'm going to be leaving, and I just stopped really caring and trying. I am on autopilot when I'm at work and counting down the hours until I can go home. I do what I can in a day, but extra effort, enthusiasm, and long hours are absolutely not happening. Historically I've been high-functioning and been able to hide this problem to everyone, but lately it reads all over my face and I just walk around lifeless and sad. 

On top of all this, my projects have been extraordinarily difficult, even for someone who cared and had more skill than I did. I know at some point my boss, who is very hands off, will want some results and while I'm trying my best when I'm actively working, I know he won't be happy with the progress. He publishes in high impact journals and his philosophy is that ""you need fear to pressure people into performing"" (his words). That said, he is extremely hands off and also never asks personal questions (not even ""how have you been?"") so he won't have noticed or bothered to ask how I'm doing. He has never taken a genuine interest in my well-being or the well-being of any of his trainees. Once, I told him that ""I need a new project to protect my mental health"" and he told me that while I would be tempted to back off and take a break, that ""I should probably we working more."" This was extremely revealing, and makes me more afraid to let him in on what's going on. However, it's getting to the boiling point where I fear I will need a mental health break/leave (maybe just a week) if things progress this way, and at that point I'd have to tell him. 

So, the way I see it,  here are my options: 

1. Disclose my depression to him, PRO: weight off my chest, explanation for lack of progress, leeway for a break, CON: lack of empathy from boss, possible risk to my reference letter and retaliation
2. Not disclose my depression to him, PRO: I stay off his radar, no risk to my reference letter, CON: fear of having to explain myself to him as to why progress isn't going well, wouldn't be able to take a leave if I needed one

What should I do?

WARNING: this is going to be a long post

I (25F) was born and raised in Vietnam, and I moved to Singapore by myself 10 years ago. A government agency gave me a full scholarship to study in a high school that heavily focused on math and science. Unlike other secondary schools’ and Junior Colleges’ standard program (O and A levels), my school invented its own diploma for an integrated six-year program that required students to take four out of five majors (math, physics, chemistry, biology and one of the humanities). 

Vietnam education is mainly theoretical and science-focused. We pay minimal attention to the arts, music, and physical education. We can produce thousands of mathematicians who do calculus with their eyes closed, but not many can bring that knowledge into practice. I was not an exception, I had quite an in-depth training on pure physics.

Since my Singapore high school allowed one humanities major, I was so glad I chose fine arts because that is the only reason why I’m not in a lab right now. 

After four years of science with a one-year research project in wafer fabrication, I knew I wouldn’t want to follow this path. I wanted to do architecture in university because I believed it was the fusion of art and science. I applied to architecture schools in the US, UK and in Singapore (NUS), but life took a turn and I went into digital filmmaking instead.

So there I was, drowning in a pool full of filmmakers with my one and only drawing portfolio. FYI, my high school forced its students to take AP exams. Anything below 5 is a shame. There was one person in my cohort who had 4 for Calculus BC and everyone was trying to find out who he/she was. They couldn’t stop talking about it. (I had 3 for my Art portfolio. No one knew this except my art teacher).

I knew I wasn’t a technical person, so I paid more attention to film studies, visual psychology analysis, and storytelling. I didn’t think much about what job I could get after graduation. Perhaps, deep down I knew I couldn’t get any job with this major so I unconsciously tried to push the anxiety and responsibilities to my future self (damn it, past self!). All I did was to learn and to survive.

To sum up my undergraduate education, I wrote and directed a few shorts, produced a documentary, and wrote a feature screenplay. I graduated with BFA in digital filmmaking with first-class honor. 

At that point, I also knew that I didn’t want to be in film production for the rest of my life. Even though the process of making films is fascinating and exciting, it’s also exhausting and expensive. The moment I graduated, the scholarship allowance stopped and I had to start earning almost immediately. That was last June. 

Life took another turn and I landed a job in a big tech company where I gave support to social media advertisers. The first few months were great, I learned so much about an industry I have never imagined myself to be in. However, after the honeymoon period, everything slowly became stagnant. The company culture is toxic and the job is degrading (later I learned from other friends that their corporates worked the same way). I applied to be transferred to another team but I didn’t make it. I stopped learning at my job for 9 months now and I felt that I was wasting my time every day. I never felt so insignificant and worthless in my entire life. All I wanted was to learn and to do something meaningful with my life.

I’m honored to be friends with many smart and highly achievers on Facebook. My work requires me to be on Facebook for 10 hours every day, it has become my habit to scroll the newsfeed until there are no more new posts. Every time my friend share their amazing work and academic achievements, I feel like a loser. 

To cope with my depression, I read psychology books and news. I wanted to know how the mind works and why some people want to commit suicide. I’m quite good at reading people (I think), and I feel a great resonance with psychology theories. I started to think of a possibility to go deeper into this field.

I cold-emailed a professor in my university whose research I found interesting and relevant to what I wanted to do. We exchanged a few emails, but he didn’t need a research assistant at the moment so he stopped replying. Apart from that, I think my research portfolio isn’t strong enough. Since I majored in filmmaking and I had to learn everything from scratch, I spent most of my time doing film-related stuff. I didn’t do any primary research in social sciences and only did some secondary research in art history and Singapore film studies. I know I must do something to improve the situation but I just don’t know what exactly.

I have quit my toxic job to concentrate on graduate admission (last day 31st July). I can sustain myself for up to one year. The admission period for grad school in Singapore opens around January, which means I have 4-5 months to prepare for it. I need a scholarship to continue studying because my parents couldn’t help and my saving isn’t enough. For the first time in my life, I took a leap of faith and I’m freaking out big time. 

If I can’t get into the grad school, I will be back to applying for corporate jobs. I know how it will go and the thought alone terrifies me. 

What chance do I have to be accepted to an MA (psychology) program with a BFA (Filmmaking)? How do you prepare for your graduate studies and what were your challenges? How did you overcome them? What do you think I should do now to increase my chance of getting back to school? I want to get a Ph.D. and work in academia. 

Any advice and suggestions will be greatly appreciated, thank you so much for reading.

TL;DR: I (25F) live in Singapore. I graduated with a BFA in Filmmaking and had a good grade. I’m miserable in a corporate job which I have quit after one year. I want to pursue a master and eventually Ph.D. in media psychology. What is my chance and what should I do to improve it?

unistudent11,t2_a3sge,2013-01-04 23:16:50,15z6iu,3,"Hi, 

I'm third year mechanical engineering student. My results just came yesterday and I learned I've failed two of my engineering courses. I'm very shocked right now. I've unbearable headache. I just took tylenol to ease of the pain. 
I had been severely depressed in the beginning of the term and I was unable to concetrate on study. As I had failed mid term for both of this courses, I was determined to work harder to pass the course. 


So for this course Kinematics, I had roughly 33 points out of 50. Final was for 50 percentages. My prof had put the condition in the lecture notes (not in outline) that one had to pass the final in order to pass the course. I did alright in the final. I thought I could get minimum 40-50 percentage in the final. I only needed to 17 points in the final to pass the course if you rule out the condition. I have emailed my prof to see my exam. Classes starts monday and I don't have much time now. I'd not be able to take 4 courses in next term as these two courses are prerequisite.


Second course controls, I had roughly 32/33 points out of 63 before final and I needed ~17 - 18 out of 37 points, which means I needed minimum 50 in the final exam to pass the course. I was very confident about this exams. I had prepared well. I was confident to get ~60 points in the final. And I don't know what happened now. Also, just day before my marks were delivered, our marksheet on blackboard disappeared for this course and I still had 6% of class material to be graded/uploaded on blackboard. This was last assignment and lab. I don't know if I actually received mark for this. 


I'd not like to blame my profs for this even though I barely learned anything in the class. I'd not like to use this as excuse either. If prof isn't great in delivering material, I'd study everything from the textbook. I did the same this time and I was confident about material for controls exams especially. 
I'd very much appreciate your help. I've never failed before. I've always received B's and occasional As in my engineering courses. I take full responsibility of my actions. I only wanted to pass these courses and start fresh next term. I was also dealing better with my depression and feeling better in general. I don't know what happened.

#-------

I'm in a bit of a conundrum at the moment and could do with some speedy advice.  (This has turned into quite the ramble, and for that I apologise.)

Six months ago I started working as a temp in a GMP Microbiology CRO where things are tested as specified by the x/y/z pharmacopoeia.  I'm only a lab tech so most of what I do is counting microbial growth, lab housekeeping, and a few basic types of test. GCSE/A level stuff, really. Recently I interviewed for a permanent position, and it's reasonable to assume I'll be offered the job (only one other interviewee, no micro experience) and will be told over some time this coming week.  If I do get the permanent position I'll eventually be trained to do more complicated testing.  But even with more responsibility and better utilisation of my skills, the job on offer is not part of a career path that interests me long-term. If I don't get it then crisis over and this post is almost entirely moot! Hooray!

-

Before my current job I've had two short stints at a hospital in admin roles, and a 6mo FTC as a techician at an agrochem residue analysis CRO.  The technician job was pretty sweet, but I was foolish and would talk about pharma this, medicine that, and occasionally interesting masters courses I'd come across, so they were worried I wouldn't've stuck around long and didn't offer me a new contract.

The jobs I worked at the hospital were the only ones that I actually got real pleasure out of, despite only doing admin stuff.  I could test 10,000 samples tomorrow and have every one come back in spec and it wouldn't come close to how good it felt when I'd get to put a negative HIV result on the system for an infant whose blood I'd sent off for testing a few days before, or putting a 'No HCV RNA detected' result in, and flicking through previous results and seeing them decrease from tens of millions to undetectable.  Despite me just being the person who sent the samples off and put the results on the system and completely detached from the patient's clinical care, I still felt like I was helping in the betterment of someone's life and I'd be buzzing for the rest of the day.  

I graduated in 2015 (Pharma Science BSc [a jack of all trades, master of none type degree], Hons, 2.2), hoping to not have a career in analytical testing.  That I'd describe the analytical jobs I've had as 'tolerable', and that hospital admin roles were infinitely more gratifying reaffirms that hope, which is a shame because a large amount of underling jobs seem to be analytical.

-

So to cut to the chase, what I think I want to do is go back to uni to do a biological/life sciences masters, preferably research based. I didn't do well at school (repeated a year of sixth form, and still had do a foundation year) and only got a lower 2nd class Hons degree from a mediocre uni.  This can partly be put down to me struggling with depression/anxiety for as long as I can remember, and only in hindsight realising how much it had hamstrung me. But I can't go back and try again now I feel better (and not to be a Dunning–Kruger fool but a 2.1 was on the cards, and possibly a first).  I'm not dead set on a particular field/topic, but the most appealing courses specify an upper 2nd, or lower 2nd + relevant work experience. 

My concern is my current job doesn't offer me much in terms of transferable skills (pipetting, weighing, aseptic technique; not a lot more and I'm pretty proficient at them), especially with regards to research (try anything novel and quality wheels in the gallows), which in conjunction with my poor academic record would see me being rejected from these courses.

-

Part of me says drop the job now, look for something more relevant and in the mean time pick up other skills (eg bioinformatics is one path that interests me, so if I could learn python/java then that might make up for only having a 2.2), especially if I can get accredited/certification. I can also learn to drive and broaden the jobs available to me.

Another part says don't be a fucking lunatic and decline a job because I *might* find something better and wait until 2018 to apply. 18 more months in industry + possible promotions (almost certain to senior lab tech, maybe to Scientist with a little luck) will hurt me less than gaps on my CV and a lack of commitment/direction. 

A small part says if helping patients was what gave me pleasure, then drop the job *and* the idea of a masters and get another admin job in a local hospital, then work my way up.  The worst part about those jobs was the mismanagement and disdain for patients from some of the people I worked with. If I could take the reins, ditch the shitpiles and hire people that cared then.. I'm nearly climaxing at the thought.

-

I'm not sure which parts are my brain/heart/gut.  I keep flip flopping between what to do.  Do I take a job I don't want in the hopes that it counts enough for me to get where I want, or do I not and try to try and find something more appropriate?  I commute 90 minutes each way (30 min walk, 30 min train, 30 min bus) and I'm only out the lab for lunch so it's difficult to find time to talk to recruiters about other jobs.  All my jobs have taken at least that much travelling and it's starting to take its toll.  I've been reluctant to move as my jobs haven't been permanent and I live with my parents who ask for a nominal amount of rent, but a friend who lives near where I currently work has a cheap room freeing up in a few months, so the travelling could end and I'd then have the time/energy to learn to drive/pick up coding etc while working. 

-

The obvious answer is to contact whoever's in charge of admissions for a particular course for their advice, which I have for a few courses, but I've not heard anything back yet, so now I'm here.

I believe most people looking for a change in career switch form physics to CS due to better job prospects. I'm sort of on the other boat. I have always been interested in physics and was looking at getting a bachelors in physics after high school. But I chose CS(first mistake) because I thought that I'd be better employable. But the possibility of taking physics as a career never left my mind. Soon after starting college I was diagnosed with ADHD and mild depression and started medication for depression. The ADHD was never treated because its medication is illegal in our country. Few semesters passed and I started getting more and more disillusioned with my studies. My grades suffered as a result and I graduated with a mere 3.0 GPA mostly due to the saving grace of the many lab courses I took.

So now after a year off studies I'm reevaluating my priorities and really asking myself what I really want to do in life. As my grades are bad grad school for CS isn't really an option. I could study for PGRE but I took like 2 courses in Physics(choosing wasn't an option) Engineering Physics and Electromagnetics so I'm not cracking that nut. Right now I'm really considering going for a second bachelors in physics and then see how it goes from there.

I chose Wittenberg University as the college of my future, it had a beautiful campus and a swim team that I really wanted to join, so I applied and was accepted. My church had a full tuition scholarship for this university, but I was unable to use it for the first year due to another student using the scholarship for his senior year. My parents ended up having to drain everything I had and take out an eight thousand dollar loan to cover the cost for two semesters. I ended up getting pretty severe depression in the middle of my second semester and had to withdraw from the university. I spent the summer at a low paying job as a lifeguard and didn't manage to raise enough to pay back my parents.

I decided to go back to college locally at NKU in the fall of 2015.

When-You-Sleep,t2_s9en8,2015-12-07 04:25:33,3vr0g9,2,"Hey AskAcademia,

Let me begin; I am currently enrolled as an undergraduate student at a top 30 public university in the United States. I began taking courses within a certain subject that only one professor was teaching in order to satisfy a prerequisite for completing my degree program. I excelled in this class, a language class, due to my familiarity with this language from a personal background in speaking it.

One evening, I ran into the professor of this course at a bar, and we drank together - both of us discussing the course and my familiarity and passion for the language, and it was brought up that I should be a teacher's assistant - a job which duties included: creating tests for the courses; grading those tests; creating assignments for the course; assisting with teaching courses as an in-class tutor; assisting the professor with promotion of the program that was taught by them; and other various tasks that would alleviate the workload ***that the professor was paid to do***. I should mention, that for a time, I graded and created tests for courses I was enrolled in - that gave me an unfair advantage over the other students, as I had created the tests and answer sheets before I myself had taken the test.

The position of TA / SI (student instructor) was as a volunteer - I was not paid by the university, and I did not undergo any formal application, induction, or screening before accepting this position - it was simply between me and this professor.

The “relationship” (although professional, I was sometimes under the impression that the older, opposite sex professor fancied something more… personal… with me) continued to grow, and times had been reached where work I was supposed to complete for the class that I did not complete was overlooked in the grading scheme. We continued to meet socially, and I learned a great deal about this professor’s side business (that she did not want me to talk about/said that the university was not supposed to know about), the professor's personal life and relationships, the professor’s depression and other medical (psychological and physical) problems - including drug treatments for her depression (the professor has shown up in the past visibly intoxicated from their prescribed anti-depressants during meeting to give me tests), and other various information bits that I have always believed to be unethical for a student to know about their educator.

I have, up until now, bit my tongue about these discretions - as the job as the TA was going to yield me a very promising letter of recommendation for graduate school, and the job allowed me an insight into tests and assignments that I used to excel in the classes unfairly (I studied the answer keys before I wrote the tests and scored perfect on several tests and assignments because of this advantage). This, I should remind you, was all allowed to me by the professor, and she knew full well the advantages I would have in having access to this information before I had taken these tests.

After TA’ing under this professor for a few semesters, the professor began telling me about online courses that they taught, and asked if I would be interested in posing as the professor (after being given the professor’s login credentials and instructions on how the assignments and tests were to be handled) to these other institutions which included a college and another highly reputable public university - if accepted I would have been paid $1,000.00 under the table. I used the professor’s credentials to log in and view the courses from the instructor’s account, however after some issues arose with the department administration at these colleges, I was simply not told whether I was supposed to continue posing as the professor to teach/grade the courses or not - I did not end up working this “position” and it was never spoken of again afterwards.

This semester, I seemingly fell out of favor with the professor, as other classes more pertinent to my double majors took precedence over the classes I took with this professor in order to continue this trend of taking courses I had an advantage in - in order to boost my GPA. I continued to punctually and efficiently serve as this professor’s Teacher’s Assistant throughout the semester I am currently enrolled in. A similar understanding of overlooking certain assignments and tests - due to my time invested in grading tests and assignments for this professor, and my obvious familiarity with the material being covered - was implied at the beginning of the semester that I would be given the same ‘perks’ I was given in the past - namely being excused from some assignments and leeway given on my grading.

The professor text messaged me a few days ago, specifically to inform me that I had a very poor grade in the class and it was my decision to complete a semester’s worth of assignments in a weekend in order to pass the class. Aside from this being totally unplanned, as in the past I did not have this brought up at the end of the semester, and the notion that she never stated that anything would be different this semester as it had been in the past, this came as quite a shock to me, as I already had a solid work schedule [at my place of employment - not as a TA], and several other finals and exams to prepare for this weekend - with the final for the class I have with this professor being tomorrow. 

***EDIT:*** I should mention that I speculate - in line with my suspicions that the professor intended to initiate inappropriate personal relations with me, and in light of me sharing with her a new relationship I am currently in - I believe this change in arrangement to be an act of sabotage out of some deep yielded jealousy over my romantic life. ***/EDIT***

So after reading that detailed background - I feel since this professor wronged me (even though preferential treatment of students is not a wrongdoing in itself - the professor still wronged a past arrangement that we had come to) - I feel obliged to try to repay this professor’s actions towards me with actions of my own - namely in potentially bringing this to the attention of the university. 

Obviously the professor has engaged in unethical conduct as an educator towards a student, and as well with other students in the courses being taught by them. But were there any specific laws that were violated, and what should I (potentially) tell the department chair *IF* I deem this worthy to be brought to their attention?",AskAcademia,Question Regarding Breach of Conduct for a Professor
[deleted],,2014-10-22 12:51:56,2jzkug,2,"I want to pursue an MFA in creative writing.

I already had a terrible, misguided attempt at applying to PhD English programs that led to me getting 0 acceptance letters a few years ago. I found this incredibly demoralizing in a deeply personal, emotional way. And I have to confess, as I look at applying to grad schools now, the fear of getting slammed with another half dozen rejection letters is really holding me back. I've been out here trying to churn out resumes and cover letters in the real world for a few years, scraping by on odd jobs and poverty wages and I hate it. The only place I'm happy is on a campus and it seems like higher education is essential for continuing any sort of creative/intellectual/academic career. The publications I apply to are full of interns with published work and an Ivy league masters degree. I can't even get a full-time, unpaid internship in a city I could never afford to live in. Out here in the free market, even my grossly exaggerated resume doesn't seem substantial enough.

I had a really rough start to my undergraduate career due to poverty and depression. Unfortunately, I kept going back to school year after year, hoping my financial problems would be suddenly resolved and I'd be able to focus on school, but they never were and I kept driving my GPA down into the ground. Finally, I went on academic suspension for a year, saw a therapist and came back to school after I was old enough to qualify for Federal grants, alleviating the financial constraints that had caused my social dilemma, depression and deficient GPA. When I came back to finish my degree, I made straight As for those last two semesters and I finished my Bachelors in English Language and Literature.

So my final qualifications are as follows:
* 2.52 cumulative GPA
* 2.9 major GPA
* GRE score in the 93rd percentile verbal
* 57th percentile math (I assume a creative writing program doesn't care about math)
* Gre English Subject test 87th percentile
* My professors loved me and I have extremely good letters of recommendation
* As far as MFA writing samples are concerned, I have piles and piles of half finished manuscripts, but very little finished work. This is why I want to pursue my MFA, I need somewhere to provide me with the time and support to finish my creative work, rather than just starting it and then having life intrude and disrupt it.
* I have no published work.
* I was a member of no organizations, clubs or extra-curricular activities.

When I have asked other people for advice, they give me advice that is 30 years out of touch with what schools are like now (a great uncle telling me how UVA was just grateful to have someone apply for grad school in English), or they give me the same advice they would give a straight A student laden with extra curricular accolades. What do I do in my 2.52 situation? If I faltered once, is my future prerogative to pursue academia precluded?

So realistically, what are my chances of getting into graduate school? And is there anything I can do (choosing certain schools or approaching my application from a different angle) to help me get into a decent program somewhere?",AskAcademia,How should I approach my MFA situation?

I had kind of a rough undergraduate experience, not really knowing what to study for a while, some personal issues (depression/anxiety, which is now under control after a year of therapy), and not working nearly as hard as I should have. I was a music major for my first 1.5 years, and switched to astrophysics halfway through my sophomore year. I was somewhat mediocre at it, mostly due to my lack of hard work, and I'm hovering at about a 3.3 GPA at the moment.

About 2 years ago, I started to get some experience in mechanical engineering and I'm loving it. I'm currently working in a lab in mechanical engineering, and taking a graduate level course in engineering mechanics. I have several publications in various journals for engineering and a good history of lab experience at other universities as well as at Columbia.

My current plan is to take a year or two off and find some lab tech positions to help pad my resume and make sure that this is what I want to do before going ahead with graduate school in engineering mechanics. I'll be taking the GRE and doing applications at this time, so I definitely won't be doing anything for this application cycle. I'll also be looking for fellowships to sort of alleviate the cost. Meanwhile, I'll try to take whatever high level engineering courses I can, although I'll be a little limited since I'm still finishing my astrophysics courses.

Is there anything else I should do to be moving along? In particular, one of the ideas I'm toying with is to get a Master's, and then apply to Ph.D programs afterwards. That would sort of help out with my poor undergraduate performance and might give me a boost in applying for my Ph.D, as opposed to just applying to Ph.D programs straight off.

I'm about to start my 5th semester in undergrad, and I honestly wish I could go back to high school and do everything over now that I *kind of* know what I'm doing and certainly know what I want to do.  

I graduated from a terrible-quality private high school at the age of 16 (5th in my class; 3.8 GPA) after having been homeschooled from the ages of 12-14.  During those high school years, I held multiple competitive internships, won many awards, was captain of the scholastic bowl team, and did a bunch of other stuff that showed my intellectual aptitude to be something of high caliber and certainly something not to worry about. 

After that, I went to a community college and earned the Associate of Arts degree.  I am the first student out of my immediate family and any of my relatives to go to college.  My semesters varied a bit, with semester GPA's of:

* Fall 2012 – 2.62 GPA (20 credits; one grade F)
* Spring 2013 – 2.44 GPA (16 credits; three grades C)
* Fall 2013 – 3.00 GPA (15 credits; one grade D)
* Spring 2014 – 4.00 GPA (14 credits; one withdraw)
* Summer I 2014 – 4.00 GPA (3 credits)
* Summer II 2014 – 2.40 GPA (10 credits; two grades C)

Beginning with the Fall 2014 semester, I transferred to a semi-respected liberal arts college.  The transition to, among other things, living on campus and being hit with really difficult work in all my classes didn't help the anxiety I was already feeling after the previous two years.  I finished last semester with:

* Fall 2014 – 2.44 GPA (16 credits; Calc II grade D+)

This semester, I will be taking five academic classes (15 credits) along with 3 credits of music lessons and performance.  I'm *extremely* interested in four of those classes, the professors are wonderful, and I know of at least a few great students in each class, so I think those things will encourage me to do better this semester.  

As for myself, I've learned a few things through the transition, so I now feel at least slightly better equipped to do well this semester.  After having taken a few classes in the subject, I now know exactly what I want to study and what I want to do with it.  That has given me a spark of motivation.  Additionally, I am going to start medication for the first time to treat my ADD and depression.  I have at least some hope that getting those taken care of will help me in school.

-----------------------

**The main concern right now is this:** Due to both financial and personal circumstances, I will be transferring after this semester.  I will likely spend 4-5 semesters at whichever institution I transfer to.  Because I plan to complete an MA and a PhD (separately) after undergrad, and I hope to someday teach at the collegiate level, I need to figure out:

1. How to transfer to another good undergrad institution,
2. How to do well from here on out,
3. How to look like a strong candidate for grad school, despite my mistakes.

I know that I've completely thrown away some of the prospects I had in high school, but I'd like to believe that I can still study somewhere good and land a solid job in academia in the future despite the rough experiences I had in the first few years of undergrad.

I also struggle with an oversharing problem and have to filter out most of what is actually on my mind.

I've been tutoring for a year now and these issues disappear. I genuinely enjoy talking to students and because the sole purpose is academia, I can always default to that subject without painful small talk. I end up being friendly and quirky and knowledgeable, and for the first time in my life succeed in the job even while going through the lows of depression and the highs of mania.

I dropped out of school last semester, to take some time off to work and clear my head. I've been suffering from major depression and anxiety problems, and I think it's best I stop school for a while. 

But in the past few months, my mind has cleared a bit. Enough to realize I don't want to finish my degree (3 years of school, 2 of them dedicated to a CS degree). It's just too strenuous on me. 

With some encouragement from my therapist, and parents, they've suggest I look into paralegal, or teaching, or therapy work.

Paralegal because: I have a high moral/ethical code I live by, and love to research things. I also like to play ""devil's advocate"", and don't believe anyone is really *bad* or *evil*, just misunderstood and in need of help.

Teaching because: Although I'm kind of scared of kids, I've been told I'm really good at helping them have fun learning stuff, am good at interacting with them, and both teaching and paralegal sound nice, because I'm helping make a difference in the world, even if it's just a small contribution. 

Therapy because: Well, my therapist recommended this one for me, and I've never really considered it, because I know how flooded the psych major pool is nowadays (although I think you need a masters to be a therapist?). She knows I live/love to help people, and my mental dilemmas could help me relate to clients better.

I graduated from my masters 5 years ago and am wondering if I should purse a PhD. It seems great money wise, although long and hard. 

For context, I grew up in poverty my whole life and saw education as a way out. My friends and family did not see this as a tangible way to move upward in life. I had one friend who worked at the bank and he bragged about it to everyone one in our impoverished neighbourhood. From then on people associated work at the bank (literally working in proximity to money or a vault) meant that you pretty much “made it.”  

My mother started getting really frustrated with me as I grew older because she could not collect welfare checks claim me as a dependent once I became 18. I have been working since the age of 13 and had all ways had to pay my own bills since then (expect for rent). 

As I got into one of the most prestigious schools in North America, I felt super proud of myself. My parents couldn’t care less. This came after my father lied to people when I was 19 (I was at community college before uni) saying that I went to the said prestigious university that I ended up matriculating into  a few years after. When the friends he lied to discovered I did not attend the prestigious institution at that time, he was disappointed that they had found out (because they asked me). 

Fast forward 2 years later, I get into said institution for undergrad, he mentions this to no one. Fast forward 5 years later when I finished undergrad and go back for my masters (at same said institution), he does not congratulate me or anything. I was led to believe my whole life that attending this prestigious university would make my dad proud and get me the attention that I craved from him that I never received as a kid. Fast Forward to graduation at the end of my Masters, all of the sudden he wants to attend graduation like he supported me during those lonely, late nights at the library when I was studying super hard thinking about a PhD future. 

Although I feel grateful for having achieved this accolade, between working several jobs, time with my girlfriend and studying, I didn’t have much time to spend with friends and cultivate new friendships. That is something that I am deeply regretful of and wonder if I will ever had the close-knit group of friends I once had from childhood, as well as in college. 
Because I studied so much and felt myself become a bit of a recluse, I sorta promised myself that once school is over I will focus on making money and getting my social life back, it’s been quite the struggle. 

Basically, I am wondering if pursuing a PhD may somehow may hinder or maybe enhance these efforts. Not that I am looking to go into a PhD to make friends (the lifestyle is kinda cool, not to mention the possibility of advancing the field I am in), but part of me worries that I may suffer more depression, loneliness and alienation (because of race)that I had felt during my masters program.

I am about to appeal my degree classification and just wanted some unbiased advice, please. 

Throughout my final year of university I’ve had increasing mental health issues (depression &amp; anxiety) which were diagnosed 7 years ago and known to my university, I had a meeting and they gave me a generic “Summary if Adjustments”. There’s a fairly extensive paper trail (emails) of me requesting support, attending meetings, the university acknowledging my circumstances and agreeing to support me. 

I applied to have counselling at the university which was 6 sessions starting at the end of September 2018. These 6 sessions didn’t have a major impact on my situation but they definitely helped. I was in contact with the student welfare officer regularly who helped me in applying for deferrals for 2/3 modules that were due in December 2018 as the counselling sessions ended in early December. By this point I was still struggling but even more so as I found out my grandma was not well, who I am close to. Both the councillors and the welfare officer advised me to go back on antidepressants, I was off because my GP at home always has someone new working there (I assume it’s a training place) and explaining my situation to a new person every time is stressful and it’s not easy with anxiety. 

The welfare officer told me to use the student medical centre, so I signed up, spoke to someone and they prescribed me half my original dosage of Citalopram (from 40mg to 20mg) in January. This antidepressant takes 4 weeks to start having an effect. Just before receiving this my grandma passed away, followed by my aunt a few weeks later and my grandad almost exactly a year before my grandma (my last grandparents). 

I arranged a meeting with the welfare officer again and told her my mental health is deteriorating and how I’ve lost my grandparents, I also told her how I’m having family issues as another family member was lying, withholding information and pushing for an autopsy on my grandma which delayed laying her to rest, this was culturally wrong and was hitting my mum extremely hard, so I moved back home for a few days to support her. The welfare officer emailed the counselling service at the uni and asked for me to have urgent sessions because of my situation. 

I was offered a group mental health workshop a month~ later, which I could not attend but asked to join the next one and was told I would be informed, as that was when my grandmas funeral service and cremation were happening and I moved home for that. This other family member decided to cut my mum out of all communication because they wanted more support but my mum works and they do not. When it came to the viewing of my grandma, we were told by a different family member a time and a place. We go there and the  family member who has been causing all this mess put a password on viewing my grandma and wouldn’t tell us. My mum complained and we got to say goodbye. 

Sorry if this is too much detail or sounds like a sob story but I’m just trying to get my point across. 

I moved back to university and continued with the semesters work but extremely struggling. I contacted the welfare officer again saying I’m seriously struggling to do normal things like eat, socialise, attend lectures and concentrate and that I had not heard back about counselling sessions but just received a generic response of maybe deferring or extending my modules for this semester. I asked whether my circumstances could be taken into consideration when marking my assignments and she said the university doesn’t do that. 

So I go and get extensions on my modules for this semester. This wasn’t a good idea, without much support it was just extra time for me to struggle with. 

I received my results for the modules I deferred in December and had a mean of 64.67% for my first semester a mid 2:1.

In May I was called by the counselling service and was offered sessions, 3 months after requesting them and that’s 3 months of not much support from the university other than maybe extend or defer, dealing with my family issues and my own mental health - lonely times. 
I had moved back home shortly before this as I was not receiving support and thought being home would help, so I couldn’t accept the sessions but also this was after lectures had ended and it was just deadlines. 

My second semester modules came back as a mean of 53% a low 2:2, 11.67% less than the previous semester where I received counselling and support. 

After seeing this I checked the university policy and it states that if a student has circumstances which affect their academic performance, it could be requested to be considered during marking of assignments, with potentially a different marking system in place. Whereas the welfare officer said the university doesn’t do this. 

It states that appeals can be made if academic performance has been affected by circumstances of the student that are unknown to the marker and results are lower than expected. 

My overall is 57.8%, 2.2% away from a 2:1 classification. On the grounds of my circumstances, the lack of support (apart from extension/deferral, which would/did not help alone) and the misinformation of the policy above - Is it fair for me to appeal to have my degree classification reconsidered from a 2:2 to a 2:1?

I have the full paper trail and evidence but a friend had told me he doesn’t think this is enough for them to even consider it. 

Any help or advice would be much appreciated. 

Thank you. 

Tl:dr - deteriorating mental health, family members passing and a lack of support bar extension/deferral caused a significant drop in results to just miss the upper classification by 2.2%, do I have a case for an appeal?",AskAcademia,Academic Appeal Advice
kaaitt,t2_3u3qkifz,2019-05-26 08:32:14,bt5lsh,2,"I recently received a letter from my school telling me that I am academically dismissed, but am given a chance to write an appeal that must be submitted within 4  days. Thank you for reading this, I feel really helpless and it really does mean a lot to me.

I feel really alone in all of this. I’m posting here in hopes to get advice with writing the appeal, as well as how to cope with the pain and everything in my life right now. I have ADHD, depression, and borderline personality disorder.

I just finished my freshman year of college in a relatively competitive pharmacy program. I truly am passionate about pursuing this career, especially after being more exposed to it despite my failure to do well academically. My ADHD and depression have hindered me from performing to the best of my ability academically. 

SHORTENED SUMMARY OF MY SITUATION:


- entered college with no therapy or psychiatrist
- depressed, anxious, difficulty adjusting, extremely toxic relationship, lost friends, academic probation first semester
- beginning of second semester was suicidal and was almost hospitalized. have since been getting therapy and psychiatric help
- ADHD diagnosed only in the middle of second semester, adderall prescribed and changed my life
- saw improvements in all aspects of my life
- 30 to 40 point improvement in midterm grades (there are several)
- reconciled lost friendships, clean room, some improvement 
- ADHD diagnosis leading to improvement  middle of second semester could not ignore the fact I did terrible previously
- 2 weeks before finals, prescribed medication for depression. made me anxious and had many panic attacks. did terrible on finals. frustrating bc I felt myself getting better. instantly stopped medication and feel better 
- stopped going to therapy for three weeks because can’t seem to connect. have a plan to go to DBT
- have made new study plans and methods, taking summer courses for failed classes where I can use and practice them to prepare me for fall
- will my university understand? prepared 2.5 pages for the appeal, academic advisor said length is fine. if you read details below, what do i include or omit? Is there hope?

DETAILS (if you wanna read pls do but it’s cool)

I managed to do well in high school after going to therapy for my depression, raising my grades and test scores. I stopped therapy before my senior year due to insurance reasons, mistakenly thinking that I was better, and cultural differences with my parents (asian). Stopping it was a mistake. 

I entered my freshman year of college enthusiastic. Not seeing a therapist and dealing with my at the time undiagnosed ADHD became key factors to my academic degradation. I had trouble adjusting to the new lifestyle, my already disorganized nature became 10x worse, and had trouble maintaining my basic humans needs. I ended my first semester on academic probation with a 2.2 gpa. It devastated me but I failed to express this to my friends and parents, something I regret. I kept telling myself that I will do better next semester, that it was my fault.

Within the first few weeks of second semester, I was truly at my lowest point. In addition to academic probation, I was also in an extremely toxic relationship that I wish I got out of sooner, but struggled to because of my mental illnesses. I would tend to hyperfocus on making it better, when really I should have been focusing on myself and my academics. Staying with this person made me feel full and euphoric when it was good, but wore me down as a human being to the point where my sense of identity even today is down the drain. I had no friends and found myself crying everyday in my dorm. My close friends left me. I stopped going to classes. I was disorganized and messy in every aspect of my life. My self esteem was practically non-existent. My parents were never ones to understand my mental health due to cultural differences, so I didn’t even open up to them.

One day within those first few weeks of the second semester, I was extremely suicidal in my dorm and vented to my RA who called the police. I will forever be grateful for this person because he is the reason I am now getting the treatment and help that I needed. I was almost hospitalized  (I got out of because I wanted to go to my classes) and have since then been receiving help. 

Ever since that night, I have been going to therapy and a psychiatrist. The biggest thing that helped me was my ADHD diagnosis and the adderall I started taking for it. It not only helped me academically, but in every other aspect of my life. My parents were very against medication my whole life. Only when it got to the point where I was about to be hospitalized did they agree to let me take medication and they were very supportive in me getting better.

I only started taking the adderall in the beginning of march. I saw 30-40 point improvement in my midterm grades. I lost many friendships but was able to rebuild them. I was able to keep a clean room, which means so much to me even if it doesn’t for the average person. However, it still was not a drastic fix. I had bad days still which was expected. 

My improvement in my midterm grades could not erase the fact that I did poorly first semester. It did not erase my terrible midterm grades (there are several midterms) during the beginning of second semester, which were failing. My improvements did not take into account my failures prior to my ADHD diagnosis.

I tried and tried to build my relationship with my therapist but it didn’t work out. My improvement there was minimal. I ended up cancelling appointments near the end of april.  My psychiatrist has helped me so much and understands me. She has even directed me to a better therapy, a DBT program that is near my college. I plan on making an appointment on monday and to tell my current therapist that I cannot see her again. 

Two weeks before finals week, I began a new medication for depression. It caused me to have extreme anxiety during finals. I did not study effectively and had panic attacks everyday. As a result, I did terribly on my finals. I got a C+ in a well known GPA booster class because I did bad on the final, when doing well could have lead me to a B+ in the class. I immediately stopped the medication and feel a lot better now. I know that if I did well on my finals, which was realistic after calculating my grades (were attainable grades), I would not been dismissed because I calculated the outcomes of my GPA beforehand.

QUESTIONS AND NEED FOR HELP:

I don’t know if my university will understand this. I feel really alone and haven’t told my friends. Most of my friends are in the pharmacy program too. A lot of my whole social life (the people I see and interact with on a daily basis) is based off pharmacy. A lot of my life in general has been based off me being in this program. I cannot help but feel shame. I hold myself accountable for everything, for I should have reached for help sooner.

I am currently registered for two classes that I failed. My summer course starts this tuesday. Never have I been so determined to do well in these. I have cut off my toxic relationship too and have planned out my days hour by hour. I have planned to go to office hours and extra help this summer. Taking these courses will help me utilize my new planned studying methods so that I can be prepared for the fall, that is if they accept my appeal.

Will my university understand my situation? What in the letter should I stressed about my situation, or do I just go into as much detail as I did above? What do I not mention? What will make my case the most convincing that I can do better? I have prepared 2 1/2 pages for the appeal including steps for the future and the pharmacy academic advisor told me that is a good amount. I only have a limited amount of time and have already gotten most of my documentation to prove myself to my school. How do I deal with this dread? Is there hope?

ImportantConflict6,,2018-05-17 23:17:08,8k8o6r,2,"Hello,

so, I had to think quite a bit on whether to post this from a
throwaway account or my normal one, and at this moment I don't know
which one I will have done, if I ever post this.  Whatever.  This is
irrelevant, but I needed to include this paragraph to, I guess,
demonstrate my confusion, which is the general theme of this post.

I am a ‘curious’ person.  I like reading, learning, discovering,
philosophising, writing, exploring.  I love literature, and I love
programming.  And I ‘aspire’ to become an academician.  A researcher?
I look up to those who create information in their rooms in
universities.  To those who learn their fields to great depths.  And I
have the... push inside me to become one them, to read, to explore, to
find out, to write, to go to conferences, to give lessons, and to do
what I love for a living: learning and learning, and telling others
what I have learnt.

But, I can not consistently have this positive attitude.  The same
people I look up to, I sometimes look down upon them.  When I move on
from a fantasy of Dead-Poets-Society-esque lecturing and religiously
diligent research (which I'm too distracted to do) that leads to great
discoveries and fame, I can not stop myself from thinking that this
whole thing is (and I am afraid the following words will be offensive
for some, but I have to include them in the name of honesty) nothing
but a huge circlejerk, of arrogant and lazy people like myself, a
useless churn with a distorted image hallowing it, making a living out
of a fake-busy idleness.  Given especially the field I want to
participate, which is literature or humanities in general.

It's not that I'm without any research interests.  I'm interested in
how... and yeah.  There is my problem: I'm interested in many things,
but I can not for the life of me put one forward as a serious research
interest.  And I submerge and suffocate under the unadmittable
question: am I only a ‘curious’ guy, am I nothing more than a
wiki-walker, are my ‘questions’ and ‘research interests’ basically
completely uninteresting and dull wonders everybody trying to act like
a sophisticated person seem to have or try to seem to have?

I am about to graduate from a university course on Italian
philology. Four and a half years ago, just about to leave my teens
behind, I wanted to become a computer programmer.  Then something
happened and I found myself in love with literature, and burdened with
philosophical questions.  That questions, and pursuing them, saved me
from depression and ignorance.  Not that I was uninterested in
literature before, I always read, in some episodes of my adolescence I
wrote.  But those moments just before starting the uni I learnt
philosophy, and I learnt thinking freely.  And I wanted to read and
write, I wanted to be a writer.  Then the affascination with academy
that I was talking about came around, and then I started thinking that
if I was an academician, I could liberate myself from the
soul-consuming and personal-time-exploiting world of work and
concentrate on my incessant curiosities and the urge in me to be
free of anything ‘boring’ that I just can not suppress.  But as the
actual thing is more and more imminent, I can not hide from myself
that it is completely possible that what I dream of might in reality
be what I in actuality always dreaded and always tried to avoid:  a
boring pointless way to sell my time with merely money in return.

Now, I am a good writer (in the sense that I can compose
more-than-decent prose; English is not my mother tongue so don't judge
me with that), a good orator and---I really believe that I am---a good
teacher.  I know that when I want to write an extensive essay on
something, or when I am in front of a class giving a lecture, I will
be successful.  I know that I will be useful to my (hypothetical)
students, and that I would make a popular teacher.  But that is not
what all academia is, academia is also putting lots of time into
research, trying to invent new knowledge and change the world for the
better.  But I have the life-sucking disease that if I end up thinking
that it is pointless, I can't, for the life of me, do it.  As good as
I think I am in explaining what I think, so much useless am I in
explaining my feelings face-to-face without distracting myself and
getting bored, so I believe the best recourse for me is here.  Or if
it is not, please excuse me and concede me the relief of having gotten
at least a part of this stuff out of my chest, which I need so badly.
So, has anybody here been through these troubles?  Can you advise me
(or tell me off because at this point I feel like really really
deserving it) on how to overcome these issues, or at least find a
better path to my life (which I know is too much to ask, but sometimes
even a little anecdote does much to change one's perception of
things)?

Now I come from a third world country where constitutionally women and men are equal and over time there has been progress but society still needs to improve a lot. Although its different from family to family but in my family the rule was that women are encouraged to study and focus on getting a job but not a career , like just enough to earn enough to support yourself and never have to rely on men for support. But Independence, being career oriented is a strict no no. No girl before me moved out of home in my entire extended family before me. And when I finished school I was denied multiple opportunities, better college, better education and made to study in a univ 4 kms from home and the idea of my parents was I will study get a job locally and get married While I had been career oriented and wanted to do a PhD and pursue a career rather than just earn enough. This put me at loggerheads with my parents and I have been under depression, stress because of constant fights and arguments with my parents to allow me to study further. Eventually seeing my persistence and dedication they came around and have since allowed me to continue. However This caused me severe anxiety and affected my undergrad performance.

Discovered I liked pure mathematics way too late in life and even so, thought economics would be the more practical degree for myself. About to finish my Economics BSc at Bristol with - most likely - a 2:2 (I really struggled with the sociological nature of the subject - the maths stuff wasn't too bad, although not very intuitive and incredibly rote-learn-y. Having a chronic condition doesn't really help either, but I think doing a degree that doesn't play to your strengths can anxiety/depression/what not even worse).

In terms of mathematics credentials, I got A* and A in maths and further maths at A-level (I was around 4 marks off from the A* in further maths..), and even after 3 years of economics, I find myself having more impassioned conversations about a random Numberphile video I watched or a pure mathematics book I read (some of Simon Singh's stuff springs to mind) than current affairs/some economics paper. I have downloaded all of the first year mathematics past papers/feedback/solutions from Bristol (hehe) and plan on self-learning from textbooks as a side hobby (I've already done some of this instead of doing econ). I hope it will get to the point (in at the very least 5 years time - self study is hard and I'll have a job to juggle, as well as having to save up for the mathematics degree itself..) where I can show to an admissions officer (or whatever they're called) that I can jump into second year (and thus save a lot in self-funding).

A little context: I went straight from my undergraduate school (finished in August) to a rigorous dual degree MS program at an elite school. It was my dream all through undergraduate, and I worked my a** off to get to this position. It’s a well acclaimed school and program, I am a part of a fantastic cohort, my advisor is wonderful, and I’ve received a decent scholarship (although I am still taking on a lot of debt....another reason I am hesitant...but more on that later). 

I’ve also struggled with my mental health all through my schooling, which peaked this time last year. I actually decided to break between undergrad/grad but was swayed from my advisor, the scholarship, not having a better immediate option, internal expectations and ideas of “success”

Since I have arrived here I have been miserable. I cannot focus on my classes and am crying almost everyday. The coursework is very challenging and I do not have any motivation. Additionally, I question whether this is what I even want to study/ if this is the right step for me / if I even WANT to be in graduate school right now. These existential thoughts have just build upon my anxiety and depression and I have not been in such a dark place in a very long time. 

So I’m thinking I need to withdraw for my mental health and to also figure out what it is exactly I want to do in life. I feel like I rushed into a program without really weighing all my options and now I’m feeling like I’ve made a huge mistake being here. However, I’m also aware that this is a very good opportunity and this degree will give me more opportunities in the future. But I’m just so miserable I am hardly working in my classes. I’m thinking I want to do some part time or entry level work or something in the service sect but I’m worried that my anxiety is just going to follow me there— I am not sure. Part of me feels that my anxiety really stems from academia and that pressure and im just incredibly burnt out, but I also wonder if it will just follow me when I quit...

I got great grades in school while spending minimum efforts. In my bachelor's in Pharmacy, I was partying and living my best life, lots of friends and great social life, by the end I graduated in the 95th percentile in my class of over 90 students. 

Comes post-grad, same story, party living still doing great academically, and my research yielded one decent paper in a reputable chemistry journal IF = 4.2. Then in my PhD I actually decided to put in the hours, and I gave it my all. I accumulated enough data for 3 articles in very decent journals IF 3-5. I also published a review in a Journal with IF \~4. And now expected to graduate in 5 months (2.5 years in total). But at what cost? 

I was paid to do the PhD which is good, but what did it cost me otherwise? Well, mental health is super fragile now, wrecked with anxiety and depression. I lost my friends and social life (I was spending 10-14 hours in the lab everyday, and most weekends, for about 2 years). I lost my love life, I was quite active romantically before all this. I lost my physique, I used to be super fit now i weigh 60kg and just generally looking weak. 

By graduation, I'd have 5 papers as a first and corresponding author in Q1 org chem/med chem journals (3-5 IF). And 3 papers as co-author in equally good journals. I thought giving all I got would guarantee I get rewarded with good job/postdoc position prospects. I emailed and applied to over 30 places. I got a response rate of about 70% apologizing and saying sorry no space or no funding. I am lost and devastated.

neondreamscream,t2_4owx2hbt,2020-10-29 02:08:31,jk1l18,1,"Hi everyone. 

I'm a grad student in Japan (not my home country btw) and I have been having troubles with my research. For one thing my lab is not very supportive. The meetings are only useful for the professors to know what you're doing but they hardly offer any helpful suggestions. I even asked my supervisor if a more experienced student could help me and oversee a process I have been trying and that was failing over and over again and he said I shouldn't bother other students and had to find the solution myself. This is annoying but it is not my real problem here. My problem is this assistant professor who is the most toxic person I've ever met. He has a creepy forced friendliness towards everybody and he said more than one time to me ""I am a very kind person"", which is something kind people don't do that often. He usually say that when he is ""trying to help you"", according to himself. 

Before I list the things he did I need to say something else. I have been fighting depression and an anxiety disorder my therapist said is caused by PTSD. interacting with people is not easy for me. It has never been. I have friends but they are feel and it is very tiresome to interact with people I am not 100% comfortable with. For this reason I am quiet and I am.usually wearing ear buds. It actually helps me to focus, since we are 15 students and that professor sharing the same room. 

Now... he has given me a hard time about the ear buds a few times. He said he went to lots of prestigious universities and never saw such a bad work habit. I told him it helps me focus and he didn't believe me. 

He scolded me for not saying hi and goodbye when I come to lab and leave it at night. The thing is, no one does. Most students are very introverted and we are more comfortable keeping a distance. We still go to each other for small, work related stuff tho. He told me he talked to a postdoctoral student how weird I was for not saying hi and stuff but when I first arrived here I pushed myself against my mental blocks to do such things. And I was usually the first  in lab and the postdoc the second. I would say ohayou to him and he would always ignore me. So I lost my spirit to keep doing it. 

Last week he asked while laughing if any of my experiments had ever succeed. I told him I had one positive result and he sneered at it saying it wasn't publishable. 

Last night he saw me in lab after 8p.m. and said ""you finally became a hard worker"" implying I was not working hard before. I arrive at lab early in the morning and often leave late. I also come weekends occasionally. He has another position in a different campus so he arrives here in the late afternoon and because he doesn't see me through my whole work day he just assumed I only work the hours he sees me.

All this would just be annoying behaviour of a mean prick and I understand if you don't consider it serious. But there is more and I think this is heavier. 

In my first interaction with him he asked me if I knew what chin chin means. It means penis in Japanese. I didn't know at the time. I said I didn't know, to which he proceeded to make a motion towards grabbing the penis of a PhD student that was talking with us. The student dodged quickly. The professor was laughing a lot like we were all high school pals and the student was laughing nervously saying to me "" he is such a figure...""

He also made lots of gross sexual jokes about a few students but mostly about the lab boss, my advisor of whom he is a friend since they were in grad school. This makes me very uncomfortable. He also found it amusing to explain to me why he prefers Japanese Porn instead of western Porn. Look, I am not a prude and impressionable altar boy or whatever. My concerns are not with the topic of the conversations themselves but the fact that there is a power relation between him and the students which makes the conversation not ok! He's a professor and we are students. He is not my friend or my pub pal and he never considered that these topics made me uncomfortable even tho I barely react to his antics. 

Finally, he told me he thinks the new batch of master students is very stupid. He said that about others too. He says it laughing so there's a layer of joking over the whole thing that may let you thinking if he's serious or not. But for someone who considers wearing ear buds bad work habit I think he is very unethical in his dealings with students. If he tells me the students are stupid how am I supposed to trust him? The only thing that comes to my mind is what he is talking about me behind my back and that doesn't help me at all. 

What should I do? I want to report him to the students harassment office but they don't take anonymous reports and I'm afraid things will not turn well for me, he being friends with the big boss and all. 

Also, have you dealt with something like this? What did you do?

EvolvedIt,t2_6cjf3,2011-12-01 05:31:50,mvsd4,1,"Hi guys,
I'm a second year evolutionary biology PhD student, and I was wondering if anyone has switched advisors before and has any tips.

I was accepted as a PhD student in my biology program by a professor I hadn't applied to whose primary research interests were pretty divergent from mine, but she said she'd like to get involved with what I stated my research interests are in application. This was my only acceptance, so I took a risk and accepted the offer of admission.

My first interviews with her and every conversation I had with her through about my first semester and a half felt like trying to take a drink from a fire hose. She was clearly very excited to have me, but she didn't take the time to find out what I was interested in. I ended up getting handed a project. The question was okay, but I didn't like the study system, and I was sent to another professor's lab to learn the lab techniques from one of his grad student. The project was supposed to take around two months, but it has dragged on for 9 months and still isn't close to being finished.

I had a committee meeting last week, and I spent the week and a half before it having no idea what to say. I had very little data to show for my work and was not happy with my situation, but I couldn't figure out how to put in to words what specifically I was unhappy about. Literally the day before my meeting, it occured to me that I should stop focusing on what I don't want to do and start focusing on what I do want to do.

So I whipped up a really loose proposal on a system I've been really interested in for the last year with about 12 questions I'd be interested in looking at. I'm pretty sure my committee thought I was crazy, but they were supportive and gave me the names of several people in the department who might be able to help me with this project. My current advisor is resigning from that position.

The other issue I have is that I performed poorly last year. Besides the normal stresses of you first year in graduate school and the anxiety of feeling steam-rolled by my advisor, I was having health issues. I would have a few days of debilitating anxiety or depression that made me completely unable to focus, as well as day-long migraine headaches. The drugs I was prescribed actually worsened my symptoms. Naturally this also increased my academic-related stress, and it wasn't until the summer that I could slow down enough to figure out what issues were drug- or health-related and what was just stress-related. By mid-summer, I had my drugs sorted out and I am back to my positive and stable self.

Sorry this got kind of long.

Money is scarce, so I need to finish everything by the end of this semester, or I will go back to my original country without my degree.
Is there anything you suggest?

Hi people,

I think loneliness is common for single people,  and if they have to indulge into heavy research, at some point, lack of  intimacy will create depression and meaninglessness in the long term making research life miserable and end up wasting the potential. Dating  isn’t easy either, it's not easy to find someone; becomes harder when  you are an ethnic minority in a foreign country for studies. I  struggle with these things and try to improve myself gradually. But yet  I end up watching soft-core pictures or movies or stalking escorts online out of desperation of some intimacy (no I don’t have the courage/luxury to hire an escort for now).   
In my head, I have the images of  legendary scientists who were into research 100%. I know they also had personal lives as well. But things are *very different* today. Now we have so many distractions such as social media, academic emails. For people looking for intimacy, porn can turn out to be a cheap exit which  definitely has a long-term impact to embrace difficult, stressful  situations and deep thinking.

I don't want to whine, but just say it out loud things are hard for young researchers these days. Any thoughts on this, if you struggle(d) with these too, please share how you manage it.

With this pandemic and my recent PTSD diagnosis, I’ve been dealing with dissociation on a daily basis.. days go by without me really noticing, and it has made it challenging to meet deadlines. I’m trying to use reminders, day planers, etc. but even then some days I’m so spaced out that I ignore them or just don’t check-in.. holding myself accountable has been so hard. I’m hoping to get myself into a better routine by going into my office more often (we’ve been encouraged to work from home because of our local restrictions), but I feel agoraphobic and seem to keep pushing off actually going in. 

Ideally I would like to give plenty of notice to my supervisors when I’ll need a letter of reference, but I’ve found myself dropping the ball and leaving it to ~10 days out. There’ve been enough applications now that they have a letter on file for me, but I’m still so embarrassed about asking late (especially when I’ve been slipping on other deadlines too). 

Asking for letters of reference is already a stressful task for me, but this has made it truly painful. I feel the need to explain every detail of my situation, but that’s embarrassing and a bit much. (I feel like every single email I send includes the phrase “sorry for the delay”.)

On the whole I’m an excellent student and have a good rapport with the folks I work with (my main supervisor knows my diagnosis and is supportive, but still hopes for me to achieve a lot), but this seems to be my Achilles heal.

I fucked up with school. I was doing well, and then the last month everything just seemed to fall apart. 

Between depression/anxiety medicine adjustments (getting through their awful side effects) and getting sick with covid, I hardly even remember the past few weeks. I’m doing much better now - just in time for finals and to beg for my future! (No longer numb to the severity of my mistakes - yay.)

I reached out for a meeting with a school advisor/counselor and one of my instructors to discuss options.

So: Any ADVICE or IDEAS?

- I’m thinking of asking for an Incomplete to allow me a little more time to finish the missed homework and pass, but I’m not sure if the teacher will be willing. Any thoughts on what I could say to help persuade her to give me another chance?
- Have you been allowed an Incomplete for a class? What did you say/do? What happened in the end?
- Are there any other allowances/programs/something to look into to ask about?
- Would some kind of note from my doctor make any difference?

Other Info:
- I would be asking for only a few weeks of time, about the time of winter break between semesters 
- Because of the way my classes are offered I wouldn’t be able to retake them and continue with others until next fall semester (1year). 
- I have been regularly working with a therapist for the last 4years on various issues... I’m still a work in progress.

So I struggled with some mental/physical health issues this semester. Things were great for the first month and a half, then my anxiety/depression medication stopped helping. 

My doctor and I got on top of it right away, but it still took about another month and a half to change meds and adjust to them. The side effects pretty much put me on my ass for 2 weeks. 

In the middle of this time I had a meeting with some of my instructors and a “student success” administrator. I shared what I was going through and I wasn’t sure how long it would affect my class work, which they seemed understanding about. 

Fast forward, the last few weeks I have been doing better and working to get caught up. I had another meeting with one of my Professors about where I’m at with it and she said that she can’t pass me. I asked about possibly having more time but she doesn’t think that would be beneficial (not an exact quote, but close). She seemed unconcerned that without her class I can’t move on with my degree and retaking it will add a whole year to graduate. 

I would like at least the opportunity to finish my work and have it graded fairly, not just *give up* this semester/year because of my stupid mental illness. 

I WAS still able to attend all of the classes via zoom. The issue was not being able to complete the homework (because of said health issues). Each week I worked on the material we covered but was not able to spend the proper effort/time to fully finish it (so the work I need to make up is not starting at nothing). 

So, do other Professors think it would be worth sending a formal request for an Incomplete to this instructor? When I met with her before I didn’t outright ask for one but I get the sense she is someone that doesn’t really do them. Would it help if I outline a plan on making up the work and having it in before next semester starts?

- The class work is one big project we spent the entire semester putting together. There were no tests
- I also applied for student accommodations (didn’t know I qualified before yesterday)
- my doctor/therapist said they would back me with whatever is needed to help me continue 

If she doesn’t approve, would it be a bad idea to take it over her head? I don’t want to if it will make me an enemy or if I don’t meet the standards for an Incomplete.

At the end of the day I will accept the grade I get because that is the work I did. I just hope for the understanding that I could have done so much better and the chance to prove it.",AskAcademia,Is it worth sending a formal request for Incomplete to the Professor? I don’t want to just give up.

I'm a university student from Germany and before skimming through [r/askacademia](https://www.reddit.com/r/askacademia) I was thinking about posting on a German students' forum but quickly found out that people on there are pretty mean spirited and would not seldom respond to students looking for help with ""academia is not for everyone, either you function or you die trying, life's a bitch"".  
On Reddit, the tone's just completely different from what I've seen.

So here goes my first ever Reddit post!

  
I'm studying Bioinformatics which is at its core computer science + biology basics with additional fields in computational chemistry (e. g. protein modeling), or as aforementioned people would call it, ""useless trending shit"". My bachelor's thesis is around the corner. I've wanted to ask for topics but, well, then Corona happened, so that's on hold.

  
This is about my experiences during my time studying and about whether I should continue or not. Most of the stuff we get taught in lectures we never use again, ever. It has come to my understanding that apparently this is normal? But then why even waste time on it? It doesn't help with understanding and uses time in our schedule better spend on more important topics that otherwise will be rushed.

  
In one module called ""statistical data analysis and machine learning"" we never even got to the ML part. Instead, for weeks we performed proofs of correlations of Gamma functions and the like. And I fail to see how this is relevant to us as we are definitely not mathematicians.  
If we get to see how all of those formulae connect, fine, pretty cool even. But why do we have to dissect all of this for eternities? I get that uni wants to get you to fundamental research, but then at least maybe tell us what there's to research about this.

  
Now you could say ""ugh, well, whatever, then I'm just gonna learn stuff on my own at home"", which seems to be what we're expected to do nonetheless. However, there's most likely no time for it, because we don't just do those seemingly useless things in lectures. We also get massive homework on them. Those are usually issued weekly, sometimes biweekly but of course with additional stuff to do per task. Take a semester of about 5 courses and you're guaranteed to have at least 4 with homework.

  
Now there's a rule that says you have to pass a threshold of 50% of points to be accredited the grade you get in your exam. Meaning, you can take part in the exam regardless of your homework but may not actually pass the module (just the exam), because you're lacking in points on homework, so you will have to wait 1 year to repeat the whole thing.. for homework.  
When I started uni in 2016, there was an additional rule stating that you would need 25% on each sheet. This was in a two-semester module.

  
One night I texted a friend about the homework and she responded something along the lines of ""I'm sorry, I won't do it this week, I'm not feeling so well at the moment"". So I had to break it to her that she will fail this thing immediately if she doesn't get those darn 25% and will then have to repeat a complete year. Thankfully, this rule has been removed.

  
Now the 50% on the other hand, not that bad, right? Except when you have no idea ho many points there are in total, so you have to do as good as you can on each sheet anyway. ""I don't yet get this topic, I won't do this sheet"" and whoops, suddenly you're below 50%.  
Or if you'd like to focus on another topic for a bit because you deem it more important to you. You'd still have to put all the time and energy into every of your homework. I would be fine with that if they weren't so damn consuming.

  
In my eyes, spending 10+ hours per sheet isn't acceptable, especially if entire groups can't make it go faster. With the aforementioned 4 homework sheets per week, that's, say 45h/w only on homework, which is withing German government ruled working times already.

  
Now, 30h equal 1 ECTS (European unit of measurement for student workload) and those modules according to catalog each have about 5. So 5 \* 30h makes 150h per module, times 4 making it 600h of expected work per semester, a 5th course not included. That is lectures, seminars, reading assignments, and homework.  
However, 45h/w \* 14 weeks of the (summer) semester = 630h.. just for homework and not a single hour spent in a lecture hall.  
Doesn't really add up, does it now?

  
I talked to a member of the students' council about this and he basically said three things:  
""You can't go by those numbers"", so then why are they even there?  
The second, ""I'm sorry I can't comply with the duty assigned to me by you to agree with you in all cases, but no one cares about your little course at a mediocre uni"". So uh, thanks for the counseling? Helped heaps.  
The third thing: ""It's pretty obvious you don't come from an academic family"". Nice elitism, really appreciated.

  
All of this unsettles me greatly. Is he right? Is it all my fault? There have been times I couldn't attend lectures because I needed the time for homework. So in the end, maybe it is me and I shouldn't even be studying.

  
What angers me most about it is that there's no time to actually learn by yourself. How do they expect us to go the extra mile when you already have a heavy schedule? Some profs are sorry we can't visit lectures unrelated to our field anymore since Bologna. But apparently, there's still more than enough time for pointless tasks. (Correct me if I'm wrong; we've just never been told how any of this will profit our career)

  
I'm sorry prof but I do not learn anything by showing how mathematical functions are related and reinventing the wheel by implementing algorithms that already exist over and over again.

At least let us play with it, let us modify it, so we actually get something out of it.  
As I said, I think it's cool to see how that works. But do this once or twice and that should do, not week after week. You should be given the chance to actually do stuff you want, of course within reason. Why isn't it possible to lay off one homework but maybe, since you're interested in a certain topic, you can ask your prof for more material there?

  
I love studying on my own. I've been learning Japanese since I was about 14, started learning Spanish some years ago, love to play the piano, recently took up violin... And I actually was quite good at all of those. At least so much so that it made me happy and, dare I say it, even proud.  
Then uni came, along with some depression sprinkled on top, and I forgot pretty much every skill I acquired so far. For example, once I was able to play Skyrim in Japanese and got around okay-ish, now I can't even read the quest titles anymore.

  
It sounds ridiculous even to me now, but back then I literally did not have any time in between, be it just 30 minutes, to do anything else.  
I don't feel like I'm studying, I'm obeying orders.

  
What I once enjoyed, I now judge myself for. And I can't tell if it's the depression speaking through me, but thinking about it, it seems like such an awful waste of time to focus on those things to just forget them again in the end.

  
I had the chance to visit the Leopoldina twice and it was amazing. As I said, we actually were told to broaden our horizons by listening to guest lecturers and getting into discussions about their research. But that's not even possible if I don't wanna drop whatever I have to do at the moment.

  
Last summer, a leading expert in Life Sciences gave us a visit and our course director mailed us, we should go listen to him because that's nearly more important than anything we'd learn in courses. Couldn't, had homework deadlines.

  
I wanted to go to our uni's psychosocial counsel, course guidance and said course director about it. But since everything is closed at the moment, I decided to [r/askacademia](https://www.reddit.com/r/askacademia).  
It would be possible via phone, Skype, mail, whatever, but I fear I can't really convey all of it this way. Same goes for this post, if anything is unclear, please ask.

  
Also, I'm kinda scared about how the director would react. Usually, he's really nice (also he held the best lectures I encountered so far) and I once met him during office hours. I went there with a senator because another prof would intimidate students and no one dared to speak up, so I just went for it. Upon arrival, he immediately felt responsible and sorry because he thought it's about him. But I really can't say how he'd respond if I told him that this course is pretty much a nightmare to me.

  
I don't really know how to proceed.  
On one hand, I really wanna get that godforsaken degree.  
On the other, I'm already just so done with and disappointed by it all.  
And I don't know how the master's program will be, I don't know anyone in there. No clue if I should aim for it. People usually say stuff like ""it will be simpler"", but they did so during semesters 1 through 4 and I don't really have faith in that anymore.  
Heck, I can't even tell \*if\* anyone is in there. Most of us quit. We weren't a lot, to begin with, and started out at some 30 people, now we're like what, 5? Can't tell but definitely not even 10. Wonder why.

  
I also don't have the money or mental capacity to move to another uni, really.  
In fact, I did just move, because I've been kicked out of the dorms for exceeding the standard period of study, which is 6 semesters. I'm going on the 8th now. I didn't even shove modules around my schedule for fun, to have actual free time or whatever, but I did have to quit some in between because there just was no time for even more homework.  
Which means I also had to beg for money at the BAfoeG-Amt (German law-abiding institute for student loans), since they want proof you have earned at least 30 ECTS each semester. Fun times meeting the head of the local office and justifying my delay, getting a medical certificate and disadvantage compensation because according to them I'm too slow.

  
In case it matters, my grades are actually good and I do not struggle with the subject matter. Only with homework taking far too long. However, lots of homework topics aren't relevant in exams, adding further to my confusion and the why question.

  
That's all I can think of for now. If you do think this is my fault, please put it nicely. I don't know how much I can take at this point.

academiclady,t2_umzhl,2019-08-31 15:57:32,cxx40y,1,"A junior (though older than I) non-TT colleague has been coming to my office more and more on spontaneous visits and talk to me for hours about all his personal and professional issues. He is in a bind professionally, the university didn't renew his contract and he didn't get any of the other jobs he applied for (though he was being pretty unrealistic in his goals). 

Before this, we were decently good friends, so it seemed normal at first that he would stop by for a chat, let off some steam, and ask for some advice. But he doesn't want my advice, he doesn't respect my need for time to work - he far overstays his welcome (often over an hour, well over) and it is well nigh impossible to get him out of my office without getting a bit visibly mad at him. He is now coming by two or three times a week. I feel like I don't even want to come to work just to avoid this guy.

The real issue, though, is that I found out he has been doing the same thing with other young female colleagues, and worse. He had one who quite senior (though also younger than he by probably about 10 years), who was his sort of advocate and emotional sponge before me. When she tried to distance herself from him, he began coming to her office even more, now to say how hurt and upset he was that she wasn't supporting him when he had done so much for her (I don't really know what). 

He expected her to go to bat for him to get him another contract and when she didn't he came back saying it made contemplate suicide. He texts her constantly about how stressed, sad, depressed, and/or frustrated he is. Even going as far as sending her long emails in the middle of the night about his misery, loneliness, and depression.

I just found out about this and now it makes sense why he is moving on to coming to me more and more as she has set some hard limits with him that have infuriated him. This guy stresses me the fuck out. I got my own problems and they are legion but he never asks me about what is going on with me. He sees a counselor AND a psychiatrist.

Now this is academia and in this institution, you can't just go to HR with your interpersonal issues, the culture of the place is that HR is for real workers and they don't get involved in what they see as just departmental politics unless things get physical or sexual (or you are willing to sue). Also, he already lost the job, he just as four more months on his contract. There really isn't much they can do to him.

I need to get this guy away from me, but I am worried if I piss him off too much he will come after me the way he came after my colleague, I also live just a few blocks away from him and I haven't discounted that he will come to my house.

He is not purely evil, up until I a few months ago I would have considered us pretty good friends and I was even thinking of fixing him up with a friend of mine.

I'm a graduating senior in the social sciences/humanities and have been working on research (a co-authored paper that started as an original piece of research) with a distinguished professor in my department. He's also acting as my senior thesis advisor.

I struggle with both severe clinical depression and ADD-PI. I would never feel comfortable citing my depression as the reason for my research struggles (it's my own personal hangup), but I've been slowly warming up to the idea of maybe referencing my ADD-PI diagnosis. I've never disclosed it before because I feel like  this diagnosis is stigmatized, particularly among women (my parents, for example, have expressed doubt in the past about whether ADD is ""real"" or just a product of not pushing yourself hard enough). 

Shortly before the quarantine in my area started, the practitioner I was seeing who prescribed stimulants to me left the clinic. I was unable to find a new prescriber between that time and when everything started shutting down. I've tried discussing having my prescription transferred to my primary care physician twice but haven't had any luck. I've been going without my medication or only using a small amount to ration it as a result. 

I don't know if it's unchecked/unmedicated ADD, the depression, a mix of the two, or something else entirely, but I've found myself almost unable to work. I also have chronic health problems (autoimmune) on top of all of this, which has made things infinitely more difficult. I can hardly make it through the first two pages of a paper I've been assigned to read, much less a book. I find myself feeling completely empty and blank inside my head, like I've started to shutdown and loose my ability to process complex information. I feel like my IQ has dropped 50 points. 

My advisor is a pretty relaxed guy - too relaxed, because he's been way too nice and lenient with me and deadlines so far... I don't want to push my luck. I feel guilty, like I'm stringing him along or wasting his time. In the past he's floated the idea by me of working on my research into the summertime, after I've graduated, saying he wouldn't have a problem with this. A part of me wants to jump on the opportunity and just hit pause on my research. But I don't know how personally damaging it would be to make a request like this. 

I've never had to do anything like this before, and I'm struggling to decide how to move forward. I can do work, but it feels like ripping teeth out and it's horrendously slow, painstaking, and inefficient. I don't know what's wrong with me. I have a lot on my plate with my other health problems (invisible as they may be) and graduating. I have no idea how to communicate this without coming across as a drama queen or an opportunist who's trying to take advantage of my advisor. I tell myself that if I can't manage doing research at this level as an undergrad, then maybe graduate school isn't for me.

My situation:

I'm a PhD student whose confirmation is now nearly 6 months behind schedule for  a variety of reasons but primarily because I have been dealing with chronic mental health difficulties that flared up last year/beginning of this year. So that folks understand where I'm coming from, my mental cocktail is a combination of ADHD, bipolar, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. I've been open about all this, as much as has been necessary, but the administration side of dealing with the delays had been very anxiety inducing and until I got a disability plan in place last week, had been preventing me from being able to move on.   


My supervisor has been beyond helpful, and they are all I could have ever asked for as far as them being understanding goes but I feel like I'm nothing but a disappointment to them. For the past 3-4 months I've been ""climbing back on the bike"" so to speak, but I'm slow and easily tired. I'll manage a good day and then have several bad days in a row. Not ""getting nothing done"" but definitely not getting enough done. Today I handed over organizing of research group meetings once a fortnight because that was also draining me, but part of that was because it was meant to be a shared role - but my co-organizer was never able to be involved from the beginning of the year. I'm not blaming them, it's my fault for not being more proactive about dealing with it, but I feel like a failure.

I’m a late bloomer. I’m 22, my parents both died abruptly before I turned 20 (at different times but that’s not super relevant) and as a result I wasn’t able to graduate highschool properly and instead got my GED at 20. I was also diagnosed with ADHD much later in life than most people are (17), and figuring out that I’m not a lazy hopeless dummy has been kind of a journey in itself. Anyway!

I’m hoping in 2020 or 2021 to start school.

The rest I’m really not sure about. I’ve tried googling a little but I’m not really sure what questions I should be googling. What should I expect?

I had posted a while back on this sub about being fired as a TA after multiple delinquencies. I am working as an RA right now, and I have gotten funding from my advisor for 2 years, which is a dead end I don’t think about much. Nevertheless, I am funded, and that’s that.  I am through with my coursework(almost) after 2 years.

I have pestered them with excuses of depression and diagnosed OCD/anxiety, I mean I do face these issues but..how long can a department deal with a person who had severe incompetency issues. It worried them all, the risk of putting young undergrads under my guidance. The department has never faced this extent of exhaustion with a student, understandably. My amount of sloppiness as a 1st year grad TA was insane to say the least, too many mess-ups and failures. I would not go down that downward spiral for now, I have upset three professors and that includes the Head of the department. What is left is professors from my own sub-field and my advisor. Fortunately, they were not directly made aware of these things but of course, professors talk and they are definitely aware in some form. Besides, I did not perform too well in a class taught by one of them.

[deleted],,2015-03-20 23:49:07,2zr8on,1,"Hey all,

Before I can start asking my questions, I should probably give some context regarding my current situation. 
 
I’m a 22-year-old English major on track for graduation (possibly) next fall who has a fairly rocky academic career so far. I’ve been to three schools, a community college and two state universities (NDSU and UCF). I should have graduated last year, but due to taking a year off (2012-2013) and my credits from NDSU not fully transferring to my current school my graduation has been delayed by about a year and a half. 

My current GPA is a strange mess. In community college, I started strong with straight As; as time went on my GPA started to slip heavily due to a few mental health issues (which are, unfortunately, still unmanaged). These issues prompted me to take a year off and try to sort things out, and eventually move to ND and attend college there. I didn’t get better. My GPA continued to slip even further (a 2.7 at that point) and I moved back home to Florida last summer. As of last fall, my major GPA is a 2.9, and my general GPA is a 2.8. I’m on track to hold a similar GPA this semester; I’ll likely break a 3.0, depending on how many Bs instead of B-minuses I get. I really don’t expect As anymore.

When I started working on my English BA, I told myself that I wanted to get into graduate school despite the issues I’ve been dealing with (depression and anxiety, which are managed through… certain self destructive behaviors). Due to this, I’ve put a lot of my self-worth into my grades which is perpetuating the cycle of anxiety and depression that I’ve been dealing with for the past few years. In fact, I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/2q5px2/professors_and_tas_what_do_different_letter/) at the end of the last semester in an effort to calm myself down during a really bad breakdown.

I go through a cycle of highs and lows during each semester, where I’ll start strong, fall off hard, and then come back in an effort to save my grade. *I’ve never not gotten an A on a final paper or exam in any course I’ve taken for my BA* despite getting a majority of Bs and Cs as my final grade. This disconnect between what I know I can do and the results I get at the end of the semester also feeds into the cycle of highs and lows that I experience.

So, now that I’ve properly whined about my life, here are my questions to you:

* As a student who truly wants to get into a graduate school somewhere (at this point I’m not picky -- I know my options are limited), what are my chances? What should I do to maximize my chances of getting in somewhere? 

* What I can do about letters of recommendation? Due to my undergraduate career being fractured between schools, I’ve never had enough time to form a proper relationship with a member of the faculty where I’d feel comfortable asking for something like that.

* I’m a first generation college student, so I’m really figuring a lot of this out as I go. If grad school is off the table, where should I go from here to ensure at least a marginal level of personal success? The realization that real life is quickly coming to bite me in the ass unless I figure something out is causing me to stress out and shut down a lot more often than I used to. Unfortunately, there’s no class that I know of titled “Life After College 101.”

* For anyone who has been in a similar situation regarding mental health and school, how did you handle it? Are there any good coping methods for disconnecting myself from my grades?

Apologies if this post seems mopey and a bit too “woe is me”-ish; that definitely was not my intention. I’m really just looking for some guidance. I know that when it comes to school and my future I have a hard time keeping a level head, and that I tend to become anxious very quickly when I realize I have no idea what I’m doing, which makes trying to figure out a plan on my own really hard to do.

I just gave up on life and a fell into a deep long depression and started flunking and failing almost all my courses completely ruining my grades on the years where it even mattered. By 4th year I ended up dropping the majority of my university courses in exchange for any class I can obtain an easy credit in just so I can graduate, in the end finished with only 4 U level courses with where I had an average of 68% on my U courses. Even lower when including the rest of Mixed level courses at which point I graduated on a 63% average for my 3rd and 4th year courses, EXCLUDING the dozens of courses I failed on top of that.

For the next 3 years after graduating till now I did nothing but work general jobs and struggle with my depression. Now, despite it being 2020 within the last year, I've improved a ton on my mental health and am doing very well. I am able to say I love my life after wasting so much of it.

[deleted],,2014-04-08 03:52:18,22hm4o,1,"I'm a student in my last semester of honours. I work in a pretty specialised field, which I really enjoy, and would love to go on and do my phd in. I'm lucky enough to be associated with a pretty prestigious lab, and people are interested in my research topic. 

However, my honours year has been a rocky one. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the middle of last year, which realistically was long overdue - I was super burned out, incredibly unhappy and unmotivated, and barely functioning in day-to-day life. Accordingly, I got very bad grades (is, only passing grades) in my first semester of honours.

I tried to come back for the second semester of last year, which was supposed to be my last, but realised a few weeks in that I was in no state for it - couldn't go to class, couldn't hand in assessment, was just going to fail out. So I deferred my study until this semester, and used the time to get treatment, see a psychologist, and sort out my own head. 

So, I'm now in my third semester of honours, and I'm doing much better - feeling better, using better coping strategies, getting way better grades. I still have blue days, but I've learned to deal with them and stay motivated and productive. I feel that I can do alright this semester, and hopefully at least salvage a second class honours out of the wreckage that's been the last 14 months. 

I'm worried, though, that some poor grades and a couple of 'withdrawns' on my transcript will kill my chances of a PhD. How should I handle this issue in my applications?

For example, I applied for my dream PhD program last year, and was told ""Your research experience and references are excellent (ps: they are. I have heaps of research experience), but your current grades are too low to be considered for a scholarship"". The same program contacted me yesterday, asking if I wish to be considered in the next round of PhD offers. 

Oh god, I *so* do. But my transcript is (to date), the same as last time + those ""withdrawns"". I hope that by the end of this semester, it'll be more competitive, but that's in the future.

Should I explain my situation to them? I have certificates covering my deferred period which state that I've been in treatment for ""a medical condition which affects her concentration and performance"", without mentioning depression specifically. 

Maybe if I attached one of them, stated that I deferred study to be treated, and that I am now recovered and anticipating better grades, my poor performance would be looked upon more leniently? Or would I just look like a hypochondriac/excuse-maker/liability? ",AskAcademia,Should I mention medical issues when applying for PhDs?
[deleted],,2013-07-15 05:58:04,1ibnxg,1,"Hi,

I've been doing a lot of soul searching, and I am slowly formulating a decision on whether I should remain in grad school or not. I am a PhD student in civil engineering (structural emphasis), but I believe that a PhD is out of the question completely for me at this point.  

I just completed my second year at an ""average, nothing exceptional"" institution. I think it will take me at least one year to get my masters.

I got super depressed and burnt out after my second year. I had been feeling it for some time, and I tried to push through, but ultimately I lost all energy, passion, and motivation to go on. My adviser was very demanding, and additionally required me to take many courses outside of my major. In reality, I only have taken  2 structural engineering courses. The remainder of my courses have been EE and ME. This was particularly due to my research area, which is structural health monitoring, but honestly, in hindsight, I don't think it does me much good for a job in structural design. I would mind a ""structural health monitoring"" job, but I don't know if there is even a solid industry for that.

Last semester, I literally bombed both of my classes. I had to take an undergraduate mechanical engineering class (yeah I've taken two undergrad classes), and a graduate level EE class. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love the ME and EE subjects, its not like I wasn't interested in the material. It was just that I had no fucking way of dealing with all the stress at that point. 

The professor of the grad class that I bombed told me I have until Aug. 8th to take a final, comprehensive exam that would dictate my grade. I have barely studied. I can't bring myself to focus.

I also started smoking weed heavily to cope with the depression and stress. I don't see weed as a negative thing, but I do believe it is unhealthy for me to be smoking this much. I smoked through my first cigarette pack as well. So it doesn't seem like I'm headed in a good direction.

Its honestly come to a point where I can't even take care of myself properly. The notion of getting out of bed has become stressful, and simple tasks such as checking the mail have caused high amounts of stress. I've been on depression medication, and have not yet gone to therapy, though whether I quit or stay, I think therapy will be my next choice.

Although I am potentially close to a thesis masters, I honestly do not have the urge to continue.  I tried taking a break over the summer, but honestly, it hasn't helped much. I've been flirting with the idea for some time, and would really like to hear other peoples perspectives on what they would do in my situation.

 Let me tell you some of my credentials...this is engineering specific:

**Current Status**


* ~3 classes short for MS in Structural Engineering

* BS in Civil Engineering

* Previous internship experience

* FE license

* One 2nd author published journal paper

* Several conference papers/presentations

My idea is, I can't handle any grad school right now because I'm so burnt out and over it, so quit, take a break for a semester/look for an engineering job. Finish my MS (perhaps non-thesis) after I get a job. 


I really just want to know what other people think of my situation. Do you think I need to suck it up, or is quitting right before a MS thesis degree taking a step back. If you guys can please give me some advice, I'd greatly appreciate it.

DerErdkundeMeister,t2_1714n2,2020-09-05 22:30:08,inah68,1,"Hi everyone,

I hope this is an appropriate place to post this, but as the title suggests, I’m thinking about backing out of a co-authorship I’m involved with now. Without revealing too much, it’s for a few reasons. While the results are fine, I find myself disagreeing ideologically with a few of the analytical frameworks/conclusions that are now being put forth in the newest draft of the paper (my views have changed a lot since this project initially started last year and I wouldn’t necessarily have felt this at that time), though I can try to push back on them. The second author has also taken some questionable stances on current issues recently (though I wouldn’t say those views necessarily reflect their overall body of work), and I'm worried about being tied to that somehow. While I’m only a tertiary author, I also feel a bit guilty that I haven’t really contributed to the piece all that much anyway relative to the first author (though a new full-time job and trying to do GRE prep have been keeping me occupied).

However, I think the biggest issue is that this project is triggering some rather bad anxiety/depression issues for me. I was an RA full-time for the second author and while they were well-meaning I had a bad experience overall (part of it was some personal friction/difference in work styles/work burnout but most of it was me going through some really bad depression I wasn’t able to get therapy for at the time), and the paper/thought of working on it is triggering occasional panic attacks and anxiety/depression more generally as a result.

At the same time, I worry that I just might be overthinking it all and I don’t want to burn bridges with/be disrespectful to the professors needlessly over this. The second author actively encourages and has almost always co-authored with their former full-time RAs (and was happy to have me join on at the start of this), so there’s a bit of awkwardness there. This is especially given that I’m considering graduate study in the discipline of the authors (and potentially at the same institutions), even if I may not explicitly ask for a rec letter or work with them in the future. Also, while I could go either way, the project is interesting enough to potentially continue through, and the first author got good reception earlier on the project from another academic whose work and opinion I respect (I had not worked with them prior to this but that first author has generally been nice/approachable/understanding).

The project was largely dormant over the summer so I could focus on my job and take a head-in-the-sand approach to all of this, but now that it’s started up again and the other authors are considering submitting to journals I need to actually make a decision.

So you can see that I have a lot of conflicted thoughts and it’s beginning to gnaw at me to the point of loss of sleep. I haven’t shown explicit disinterest in the project yet and have been showing them occasional comments on the draft/data work occasionally over the past week or two (to the extent I can keep my anxiety in check and focus on it). But largely out of respect for them and potential journal submission deadlines, I don’t want to string them along for much longer if I decide to drop. I should say one slight complication is that the first author put out a working paper with me listed there earlier in the year, and I think that may have been cited already by someone else, so I don’t know if that complicates any dropping-out procedure.

Thoughts (and etiquette suggestions, I really do care about this) here would be much appreciated! And apologies for the long vent/post.",AskAcademia,Advice/etiquette on dropping co-authorship
throwaway901271,t2_74lkmag2,2020-07-26 21:29:56,hyf7z3,1,"Hi all,
This is a question I have a hard time articulating and one which sometimes requiring having to recall some depressing experiences I had with my educational experience, but I’ve always been really curious to hear from people who may have gone through something similar. 

When I was starting university, I got into a professional degree program that’s kind of like a nursing program, etc. At the end of graduating, you have basically a fixed job title and are competing with others with virtually the same skills as you, with the exception of some specialization through a fellowship or the such. Doing well is highly dependent on work experience: the job you have during school really helps you learn almost all you need to know to succeed. If you don’t have a job during school, you can still manage but it’s kind of like memorizing an instruction manual. You know? Like no amount of reading is going to prepare you for actual practice.

I’m assuming this might be happening in a lot of fields, but basically there’s a lot more graduates than there are jobs. That means starting from the time I was looking for jobs as a student, I was running into either “this position is filled” or “we’re not considering anybody at this time”. I made the most phone calls, emails and in-person visits I ever made in life. I spoke to my peers who had jobs about this and most agreed I seemed to have unusual bad luck. I had people who did mock interviews and stuff with me. I talked to my supervisors in required field experience. I spoke to my professors who told me to go to job fairs. I finally was able to secure an interview after a while, but was a bit shocked when the person interviewing me went on a rant about how she hates her job and how even her family sees how depressed she is everyday. It turned out that even after that, there was still no position available for me. 

I considered dropping out of my program several times, but I had no backup and was close to finishing. I figured my last hope was a practical year we were all required to have at the end. I came to terms with i may not get to work in an area of my liking for a few years, but as long as I had experience and income, that’s what mattered to me. In my first practicum experience, the supervisor was unhappy from me since the first time I walked into the internship. I emailed her 2 weeks prior to when I would start, addressing her by her proper title, and asked what was expected before I begin. She gave a vague answer. A week later, I asked about what time I should come in and other logistics. She didn’t answer, so I called her number and an assistant picked up who said she’d leave the message. I didn’t get an answer back, so on my first day I came the earliest time I knew the place opened. I smiled and introduced myself as the intern, she gave me a cold look and said “you were supposed to follow-up with me”. I said I did, she said no, and I told her about the emails and calls and she said “if you didn’t hear a response, you’re supposed to keep following up till you do”. Since then, she kept picking on me in ways I didn’t even know where I was wrong, and took me aside one day and said “people are watching, so you better be on your best behavior. And don’t behave condescendingly”. It was bizarre because I’m a socially anxious person and very quiet and friendly. I asked her if there was a specific concern she had and she didn’t give a straightforward response. Everyday of that experience felt like hell, but I did my best. At the end, she dismissed that I’m probably not meant for this work environment and that I’m unfriendly and unprofessional. I felt confused because that was the work environment I was banking on for a job after graduation, since the other ones, though more appealing to me, are niche and competitive that only people with work experience during school really seem to get. I finished the rest of my practicums, but once graduation was nearing I was faced with immense dread of job hunting. I didn’t feel qualified to work with my lack of experience, my negative experiences weren’t helping either. I went to my school job fairs and ran into one of the people who interviewed me previously when I was searching for a student position, she said it’s too late to apply as I was in my last year, and I asked her well once I graduate, will I be qualified to work as I have not had student experience and she said very likely no. 

I applied to 400+ jobs after graduating with not even a phone call in sight. I already suffer from anxiety and depression and couldn’t afford paying for therapy. I was in a bad mental state and didn’t think I’d ever find a job. 

Then after some other personal ordeals, I was thankfully able to get to a point where I took some research methods courses. I loved what I was learning and met incredible people. But after taking those too, I was met with some incredibly toxic experiences. I applied for several jobs, got interviews and was close to getting hired, but one place told me they picked somebody else, the other one said they’re still deciding. In the meantime, they offered me a part time role and I took it because I needed to start somewhere and make money. Weeks into the role, I realized the supervisor had no idea what she was doing and gave no directions. When I did what I could and presented my findings, she kept getting cold and angry, often exchanging glances with others in the room everytime I’d talk. Well anyway, I 
was 2-3 months into this thing and she was not 
 on top of making sure I get paid and if I wasn’t either, I could have very well been working those 2-3 months without compensation. They used a temporary staffing agency to hire me, I had to travel several miles to get drug tested and take care of other formalities (also zero compensation leading up to ~$70+ in transportation costs) and they’d keep running into issues because they’d forget paperwork on their end that made me have to travel again for drug testing, etc. All in all, it was a complete mess.

I finally got a full time position elsewhere, which was also a mess. But I was able to gain some work experience and skills and get the job where I’m at now. I’m still not always sure what I’m doing at work and stuff and still making a lower pay than many of my peers who graduated in my original degree, but a higher pay than my last job and have gained a lot of skills. I feel so much more confident in myself than I ever have before and have colleagues who are pretty supportive. I’m just grateful I’ve been able to find something and somethings that’s not toxic, first and foremost. 

The thing is, I really just don’t have any area of expertise really and on one hand I’m just trying not to think about it and see where my experiences take me. On the other hand, I have this whole initial degree that I did and technically am not using it, some part of me wants to find some way to use it again, either through an eventual research job or part time employment in that area. I’ve tried to network with people who are at the crossroads of doing that degree + research, but often I’m met with really surprised responses as to my lack of work experience that makes me have to recall the whole ordeal I wrote about above. I’m good at networking, I’ve always done my part to reach out to people despite social anxiety, but everytime I reach out to people in my original field, I don’t stand out as stellar because of the work experience issue. 

My point in writing all this is to hear from others if you’d be willing to share. I know a lot of people leave academia or leave programs and seem happy about it although I’m sure it draws some negative and painful memories that in no way im asking anybody to recall, but just I wanted to know how you were able to make transitions to new areas, how you deal with answering uncomfortable questions and what your overall experiences are like and what insights/encouragement you may have for somebody in a similar boat.",AskAcademia,"Changed my field after negative experiences, but still have feelings of confusion.

1) search studies based not just on keywords but also on specific aspects of the study. eg

* the methodology of the study (samples size, double blind, placebo controlled etc)
* the outcome of the study (ie. the cause and effect pairs, or absence of, eg. cause=depression, effect=""low life expectancy""),
* effect size

2) an organised place for discussing studies:

* A discussion group and chat room for each study
* each study only has one place on the website - no duplicates

3) user ratings of the different aspects of the study studies (with reasons):

* reliability
   * trial vs observational study
   * method planning (double blind, placebo controlled, randomisation of sample etc)
   * method execution (ie. mistakes that could have jeopardised the results)
   * sample size
   * conflicts of interest
   * faulty assumptions
* how groundbreaking the research is (does it open a new area of research or disprove previously held assumptions)

* Tagging:  
   * Research is added and tagged by users.  
      * tags are upvoted or downvoted
      * tags which get a high enough score are committed (but will be uncommitted if the score gets too low)
      * Users should suggest existing tags if available to avoid duplicate tags

      * assumptions?
      * mistakes in methodology?
   * users can search by tags, eg cause, effect, method variables etc

Second semester was great and then this fall my ex broke up with me right around my first exam and then I fell into a huge depression and grades ended in C’s and A’s.

I've taught myself so much via the Internet over the last decade (Filmmaking; 3D Modelling; Programming; Game Development; Web Development/Design; Graphic Design; Animation; Music Composition/Production; History; Physics; Astronomy; Mathematics et al.). I've explored so many topics and with some of them I have devoted Years to it and ventured very deep and yet I still can't figure out what I *really* want to do. I've been trying to figure that out for more than 10 Years. I know that no one else can really *tell me* what I'm supposed to do but... I'm desperate and I need help.

I've been to College *three* times but I either chose the wrong subject, or went for the wrong reasons and on every occasion; I left [early] with nothing (to be fair, I was forced to due to mental health on two of those). If I don't figure this out soon, I fear I will fall back into depression and then my life will truly be over as I can't deal with this for much longer. I've been spending quite a lot of time as of late trying to figure this out. I want--no, *need*--to be studying, come [next] September. I've always wanted a degree as well as a career that I can devote myself to for the rest of my days. My life is, for the most part, devoid of meaning (as is the Universe, really) but I feel that figuring this out will impart a greater meaning to my existence.

g00d_vibrations,t2_4lgi43na,2020-05-27 19:37:40,grqo3v,1,"I'm in a tough spot in my PhD right now (neuroscience), and I'm wondering if there's any PI's out there that could give me insight into A) how they would perceive a student like me (ex: a disappointment? promising but has problems?), and B) what (if anything) my advisor could do to help me move towards graduation faster. This is a little bit long but I would so so so appreciate any feedback. Here's my deal:

I'm at the end of my 4th year in a neuro PhD program. Most people graduate around 5.5 years in. I have dual undergraduate degrees in chemistry and psychology. I was a pretty promising 1st year rotation student - worked my ass off, was very engaged with the scientific problems at hand, did an extra long rotation, got along great with the rest of the lab. My main flaws were that I did my undergrad in a different field and most of my research experience was computational/data-analysis oriented, so my lab skills and background knowledge were so-so.

The 1st year of my program was classes, rotations, etc. The 2nd year I joined the lab I’m in now and then worked like crazy to get my project off the ground. In retrospect, I was doing too much for a newbie - each week I was doing time-consuming behavioral training, viral injection surgeries (I was new to even working with animals, let alone doing brain surgery on them), and calcium imaging. I also was mentoring an undergrad, and attempting to submit NSF and NRSA grants. I had very little mentorship from my PI during this time, although he is in general very approachable so this is partly my fault (I was trying to not bother him and show independence).

At the beginning of my 3rd year, my advisor didn't get some funding he expected so I had to teach. Here is where I'll mention that I have ADHD (inattentive, diagnosed very young and re-diagnosed multiple times throught development and in adulthood… aka I wasn't diagnosed freshman year of college cuz classes got hard). My workload became too much for me to bear. At some point I cut the behavior part out of the project in order to reduce my workload, but apparently it wasn't enough. During the second half of my 3rd year, I started having mental health problems (I also have bipolar II.. yeah), my performance declined, and I started missing days of work due to anxiety attacks, depression, and mixed manic episodes.

At the beginning of my 4th year I had a little mental breakdown and had to tell my PI what was going on (he basically asked me what was going on with me). He was surprisingly understanding of my situation. We decided to delay one deadline that was approaching, and to move forward by having weekly meetings. All in all, things seemed to be improving slowly but surely. I was working at a bit of a slower pace than what I consider ideal (not working weekends for the sake of my mental health, etc), but my work was higher quality and the progress felt steady and consistent. However, I still had yet to reach the VERY first project benchmark I had set out for myself at the beginning of all this (for anyone who cares, I'm trying to get DREADDs to express in a brain region so that I can suppress that region, and I've failed to demonstrate whether this method is working successfully or not). I should mention here that I perform lab work much slower than most other people, probably because I adhere strictly to my protocols and spend a lot of time setting up and preparing for each surgery/experiment etc. I beleive this is due to my ADD - without taking this extra effort, I make dumb mistakes. I've noticed that my mind does not seem to ""automate"" things well.

Then, covid hit. Lab access is severely restricted, and the animal care facilities people have put up a ton of new rules (I've gotten in trouble for breaking animal care facility rules several times before - nothing sinister, just my fucking ADD making me forget things and misunderstand rules in the first place). 

Originally my boss said no one should go into lab at all, but I asked if I could finish up some experiments. He got me approval to do that. The next day I found out that I could resubmit my NRSA in 3 weeks. I didn’t make much progress with experiments during that time because (surprise surprise) grant writing is hard for me but I really care about getting good at it so I dedicated a lot of time to it (plus I want the grant, obviously). Then I finished up the main parts of the experiments, but I haven’t sectioned the brains yet (last step). 

Next week is my week to give lab meeting. I told my boss 2 weeks ago from today that I wanted to present a (really cool) journal article that he had sent out to the lab email group earlier this quarter. He told me I should try to present data, and I said I didn’t think it would be fully done by then. Today I sent him another email asking if I could be scheduled to do sectioning next week (last step of data collection), and also saying again that I wanted to present the article for lab meeting, not data. My PI is notoriously non-confrontational. But, he sent me an email back saying in a frustrated tone that I’ve “been lucky to be able to do experiments during the lockdown, and I keep pushing it back”, and that he wants me to finish the sectioning this week and present the data at lab meeting. 

I don’t want to do that because A) there’s so much pressure to get in and get out of lab super quickly because only 2 people can be in at a time and it’s very booked up, B) I hate having less than a week to digest my data and put together a presentation, and this will give me only 3-4 days, during which C) I have to grade 100 homework assignments, and D) I would have to work through the weekend, which, I know a lot of people say you have to work on the weekends to be successful, but I am currently of the opinion that you need to “save” working weekends for when it’s really necessary. This is not one of those cases (I mean I’ll be grading this weekend but that’s it). Last month, when I was working furiously to meet the grant deadline - \*thats\* when working all weekend is warranted, IMO. Even if I have awesome results, I can’t get back into lab even part time for at least 2 more weeks. 

When I got my PI’s email I got super pissed off and also sad because it reinforced my sense of being incompetent . After calming down just a bit I wrote him an email that was a bit snarky at first but then I went on to “be real” with him. I told him I feel like he thinks that I’m not progressing fast enough and that I agree. I told him that I’ve noticed I’m not very good at lab work, and wish I was doing a data-focused project like I had done in undergrad. I told him I’m worried about graduating on time. I asked for his advice. 

I want to mention here that in the past year since recovering from my little breakdown last summer, I’ve started to realize that I’m a very good conceptual thinker and that I’d rather do some line of work/research that focuses on that. For instance, I’m very into neurophilosophy and my favorite thing to learn about is general principles in neuroscience like circuit motifs, etc. I just like connecting the dots across different areas of research, and I’m good at it. I’d waaaaay rather do a lit review than an experiment! In the future, whether I stay in academia or not, I don’t want to do anymore non-human animal experiments. I want to work mainly with data and theories. The main hurdle to this is I need to improve my math and programming background, but I know if I had the time I could. I’m already working on this in my spare time to the extent that I can.

Here’s what I want to know: What the f\*ck do you think my PI thinks of me? Is my behavior normal for a grad student? Like is what I’m going through common for certain personalities in grad school? Is there any advice you would give to my PI in how to best deal with a student like me?

Here the final thing I want to say because I just need to get it off my chest. If you read this far, I thank you very much. As a kid I was always considered either really smart or really dumb, depending on what age/grade/teacher etc (and not in monotonic way..). I’ve always had this massive fear that I’m never going to be able to function well in society, because I always seem to be bad at my job (worked in food service for a long time and was always getting fired cuz I sucked). I actually dropped out of high school and didn’t start college until like 22. Science research became kind of a safe space for me at that point in my life, because all of my other deficiencies didn’t really matter since I was so good at learning and thinking about science (probably because I’m so interested in it). But now I feel like I’ve hit a wall where, I can’t keep up with the demands of this career field. It’s not that I had a big dream of being an academic per say, it just sucks to fail at something I care so much about. It's pathetic that no matter how hard I've tried so far, I'm still failing, almost 5 years in.",AskAcademia,What would You do with a Grad Student Like Me?

I flunked a class I needed to graduate and was unable to finish my thesis (I was one class and half a thesis away from graduating, but depression doesn't listen to any logic!).

Anyway, I left my masters program and unfortunately, I probably didn't do it in the best way I could have.  I really did try to tie up all the loose ends so that another student could take up my research, but it took much longer than it should have, and I know my ex-adviser was not pleased with my work.  (Once again, depression is a bitch)

I now am working in industry.  I'm a design engineer in R&amp;D working in new product development for a medical device company.  But this isn't what I want to do long-term.  Ideally I'd like to go back to academia, get a masters focused on controls and robotics and maybe go onto a PhD so that I can be involved in more new things.  My other research interests lie in engineering education as I'm particularly interested in how to teach advanced technical subjects in other ways besides lecture.  (So like, grad level courses)

I have a much better handle on my depression now (mainly due to actually having a support system) and believe that I might be able to handle the workload of grad school within the next few years as I learn coping mechanisms.

Problems: 
* I'm currently doing absolutely nothing with controls and there's not many places
* My grad school grades are abysmal.  I think I had something like a 2.8  (in undergrad I got a 3.69)
* I don't have anyone to give me letters of rec from academia.  My old adviser shouldn't be asked because I was objectively horrible.  The other two profs I would have asked before have died and have left academia.  I can probably ask my tech lead and manager to give me letters of rec, but they'll be from industry, not academia

It went as smoothly as it could have been. Rejection. Sure, I'm in the reserve for the job, but at this point I doubt that I will be able to get it.

Of course, everyone tells me that this is normal, that rejections are part of the academic life.

[deleted],,2014-09-22 22:21:39,2h65q3,1,"I started my PhD back in 2008, at a rank 25ish state school.  In 2009 I joined a research group doing theoretical condensed matter research with applications in quantum information.  My first project with the group was a satisfying success, and in 2010 it led to a good publication.

My qualifying exams in 2010 were a nightmare.  I cracked under the stress and entered years of depression and suicidal thinking (they eventually gave me a pity pass).   

I finally got myself back on track in 2013, and got involved with a large numerical project that lead to a publication.  This coincided with me becoming a long-term visitor at a top tier school, and some of my co-authors on this publication are famous professors in my sub-field.

I have one more paper I'm writing up now, which is numerical work with an undergrad.  I am not really proud of this work but I am kind of desperate to bolster my teaching credentials as a back up plan, since I need to apply for my next position really soon and I don't think I have done well enough in research to merit a post doc.   I enjoy teaching and am good at it, but I have been an RA for the past 6 years so on paper I don't appear to have much teaching experience.

Ideally I would like to stay in academia.  I was 16 when I decided to become a theoretical physics professor.  But maybe doing full-time research has peter-principled me beyond my own competence (I excelled more at learning and teaching textbook material).  I guess there is a small chance that I could be a late bloomer in research (part of why I have so few publications is that I spent a ton of time working on deep problems, and I perpetually feel on the verge of the making progress but it never materializes).  

Besides my barely-enough-to-graduate 2.5 publications, I'll also have 2-3 letters of recommendation from well known professors who seem to like me.  My advisor thinks I have a decent chance of getting a post doc, but to me it seems unrealistic because of my lack of publications.  Also I am worried that even if I get a post doc I will be unable to fulfill the expectations of that role.  I need to build confidence.

sisyphean_throwaway,t2_7uovf8bq,2020-08-25 23:01:42,ign6zl,1,"Throwaway for obvious reasons, also editing out names for confidentiality. I guess I'm an incoming grad student, used to be a post-bacc, in field biology, USA.

Extremely long story short, after 5 years working as a lab tech/manager I decided to pursue a PhD with a researcher (lets call them Dr. Y) who I was coauthor with on a couple of papers and ""knew"" from field expeditions, conferences, and other interactions. Dr. Y's public persona was slightly arrogant, a little rough around the edges, but generally likable (in my opinion). People (Dr Y's students included) told me to expect hard work in his lab and I was OK with that because I respected the research and I worked along side grad students in my old advisor's lab and understood the demands they faced. Only after joining the Y lab and moving across the country did Dr. Y's actual persona reveal itself. 

His students seemed genuinely afraid of him and would essentially drop whatever they were doing anytime he was in the lab in order to be at his beck and call. 

The weekly group meetings seemed more like fascist interrogations where he would want to know exactly what every person did each day/hour since the previous meeting. 

He proudly boasted “yeah, this one student of mine quit because of some mental illness possibly induced by me, I essentially broke her.” Later he said he saw that student working at the local home improvement store and bragged that she turned away when they made eye contact.

He purposefully obfuscated research directions (on a proposal edit he completely rewrote the intro, added ""[1,2]"" citation markers for the concepts he included, and said ""this is your proposal, do your own lit search"" when I asked him to forward the papers he cited). 

When I confronted him about needing more work life balance he mocked my increasing depression and said ""your wife will have to get used to being alone because you will be spending more and more time in the lab and your personal life is going to get less and less"" while making a pinching motion with his fingers. 

I tried to find a middle ground but it was his way or the highway.

I could go on unfortunately...

I left the program after 2 weeks of dealing with his persona. This is what my in lab grad student mentor said about the situation: ""I certainly don't blame you for making that decision. Dr Y has always been prickly and sometimes unreasonable, but he gave you just about the roughest time I've seen for someone just starting in the lab and I can't understand why.""

I couldn't change advisors because of a political dispute between my old advisor and the new department I was accepted into. I went to my old advisor for advice and he essentially said he didn't have any because he has never even heard of that sort of situation before. I have been told officially reporting Dr. Y's actions could be career suicide but I also want people/future students to know what kind of person he actually is. He is definitely a two sided coin and knows when and how to show the ""good"" side, but is also very aware of the bad side and takes measures to ensure there is no tangible evidence of wrong doing. Most of the questionable behaviors I encountered were verbally communicated.

Fast forward to today... I have been accepted into the PhD program at my old institution, working with my old advisor. Dr. Y is in my field of study and somewhat well known. My question is, do I report Dr. Y, and if so where? Do I do nothing and make the least amount of waves?

So, this semester has been extremely hard for me. I'm currently a second-year student (undergrad), and my mental health has just gone to absolute shit. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for the year and a half that I've been here; I developed an eating disorder and have continuously been losing weight, to the point where I'm now borderline underweight; my swim coach potentially exposed me and my teammates to COVID; my hair has been falling out due to stress and a lack of food; I'm currently in the process of transferring schools; and my grandad recently passed away. It's just not been great, and I'm finishing the semester from home so that I can recover from this all.

To top it all off, my physics professor told me I was academically dishonest on a recent in-class assignment. 

I went home last weekend for my grandad's burial, and I realized while I was gone that I'd missed a problem exercise (a question we have to solve in class). I panicked and didn't want a 0 to hurt my grade, so I texted a classmate and asked if she could put my name on their group's sheet so that I could get some credit for it. She said yes, and now here we are. 

The thought literally never crossed my mind that that would be cheating, and I wasn't aware of the class policies for making up work like that. I also didn't have the forethought to tell my professor that I'd be gone--I was just so overloaded with emotions and stress at that point that I just wanted to go home. 

I admit that I did something wrong, yes. But I'm so scared that a report of academic dishonesty will kill any chances I have of going to grad school for physical therapy, I've been feeling physically ill from stress.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost every call I have with one of my friends nowadays ends up in the same place, devolving into a conversation about my job: that fundamentally I’m not happy anymore. I’m a postdoctoral researcher.  I live in one of the most romantic European cities, and have lived in several others, have a passport full of visas and a Google Scholar page full of publications. On the outside, this may sound glamorous, but from the inside looking out, it is lonely, cold, and redundant. I’d like to put a date to when these feelings started, but there has been a slow and steady tsunami of disinterest evolving into sheer contempt for what I do.  

It is highly possibly it started with the suicide of my late husband. After someone dies from suicide, everyone tells their survivors not to place blame, but when some is both the perpetrator and victim of their own death, only Budda could avoid asking the question of ‘why?’  Since I had left my late husband, let’s call him Bob, several months before he made his choice to take his life, certainly I spent a lot of time blaming myself, but that story is for another day. The autumn before he took his life, Bob had his funding withdrawn by the University because his PhD was taking too long.  His advisors had requested he change the foundation of his dissertation work from an experiment to a survey and then back to an experiment, all the while he was required to continue teaching classes to maintain his salary and fees. Bob loved his research, but I watched his interest and motivation wane.  What used to be hours spent on what he called “dissertating” turned into hours of reading about conspiracy theories and playing video games, a notable avoidance of his work. I did not anticipate that this was a path I would come to follow.  
After he died, I promised myself that I would not let his death prevent me from finishing my PhD.  I withdrew socially, for a time being, but continued to teach, had several publications, finished my PhD on time ,and found a postdoc in another country.  I considered myself a success, despite immense adversity. I never talked about what happened in a professional space or really once I came to Europe, I wanted to be separate from the trauma of my past, and accomplish great things in the academic world.  

I was so desperate to leave the past behind that I had decided my priority was to leave the US.  The postdoc opportunity itself seemed secondary to highly reputable institutions where Einstein roamed the halls and the exquisite backdrops of Parisian blue roofs, the Alps, and the French Riviera. Little did I know that Paris is a cold and indifferent city, where particularly without speaking French, loneliness is the first friend you will make.  My position was somewhat unique in that my academic advisors were located in Zurich and the French Riviera; and I actually worked with no one from my institute. 

As an act of service, a researcher at another institute in Paris allowed me to come to their meetings once a week. However, he seemingly preferred to spend time with me as a drinking partner; where one he informed me that based on my lack of interactions in his lab group’s meetings and since seeing me at a conference the year prior I had “lost my spark.” 

This comment offended me deeply. This person didn’t know me.  They never took the time to talk with me about my research, but had some expectation of what constitutes a “spark” based on how I interact with their research group about their research -- a topic which was almost entirely new to me. Although, in some regard, he was right. The project I was working on was completely contrived by my supervisor; any ideas I had were drowned out by micromanagement. What I had loved about research was stretching ideas, but my ideas now were muted. I was starting to forgot how to think critically, and the research I was doing I found utterly meaningless. The research was based deeply in empiricism, which I am not fond of in principle and should have worked to separate myself from.  The results were also tenable; for example, changing the dataset only slightly, could produce vastly different results.  

At this point, I was essentially floating around Paris, meeting with scientists in my field when I could to stay minimally engaged in my field, occasionally going to Zurich for a month or so to work with my academic advisor. My greatest solace was the friendship of a Swedish economist I’d met through reddit, who was the greatest godsend. She and I suffered through Parisian expatriatism together with the greatest delight, that it actually made Paris quite enjoyable. 

Because of my lack of connection to any research body in Paris, my supervisors offered to move me in my second year down to the French Riviera. It was my favorite place I have ever lived.  I came in with a renewed sense of confidence, hoping that I could really make a home for myself.  Feeling a bit lackluster about the project I was assigned and following advice I’d found online for disillusioned postdocs, I decided in order to revive my so-called “spark”, I should work on something that I truly enjoyed. So, I continued to delve into something I started during my PhD, and published a paper on it, as a single author. I had informed my supervisors I was working on this, for which I had their approval, but when it was actually published was when the other shoe dropped.  

I won’t go into the details, but the relationship with my supervisors dissolved completely. Largely unrelated to the project I was working on, or the paper I’d published, I was accused of lying, stealing ideas, a lack of professionalism, being a “princess” and a “child.” Once, when my contract was coming to an end and I had an interview, which conflicted with a trip to Zurich for my job. After seeking advice from my advisor in Zurich about what to do about my interview -- also given that coronavirus was on the rise, without my consent, she cancelled my trip there and the other advisor scolded me for it. I was being bullied from both sides, I could do nothing right.  Then, the kinder of my two advisors came down with coronavirus.  I was left with one advisor, who literally has a nationwide reputation for bullying.  At her current institution, her last three female PhD students did not finish. Most of her other students do not  wish to stay in academia. After working solely under her supervision, I see why. Her comments were not about my work itself, but about me as a human being. In comments on manuscripts she would ask me what was wrong with *me --* not to see an error that was in fact not so evident.  She even corrected my English incorrectly, which is ironic, given that she is a head editor in a top journal in my field. 

Socially, again I retreated, which must be a coping mechanism, but it also happened to correspond with Coronavirus. My confidence began to fizzle once again and doing work was worse than pulling teeth. I used to envision myself as a mentor to students, pursuing research about a growing mountain of ideas I had, but this idea becomes increasingly hard to conjure as time goes on. Miraculously, I found another position with a fantastic supervisor and research group in another city in Europe, but I’m afraid I’ve burned up. The version of me that wrote Marie-Curie proposals and papers for fun has vanished. Despite a much kinder boss and involved and enthusiastic colleagues, I can’t bring myself to open a terminal window, or read a paper. I’d much rather write about what I’ve been through, because I know that Bob and I are not alone. Instead now, I see myself speaking about my experience. So many years of being afraid to share my experience, thinking it would help me to succeed in the world of academia has finally made me want to leave it. I don’t know what I want to do, perhaps become a mental health advocate.

The bottom line is that academia is an exceedingly stressful environment. I see people, including myself, retweet positions for PhDs, and I want to say, side effects may include: anxiety, depression, self-sacrifice, loneliness, lack of stability, career uncertainty, and a systemic lack of support, godspeed to those who try. Academia is not for the faint of heart, even for the strong, it requires an enduring support network (even if not nuclear, extended), an unwavering passion for what you do (which I think sometimes cannot be determined when you are doing a PhD), and a good hold on how to maintain your mental health. 

I am just one voice of many, but I am calling for change. Somehow there are oceans of money for armies of PhD students and postdocs, who are routinely underpaid.  These same graduates have a scarcity of jobs. Let’s systematically reallocate funding for fewer PhD students and postdocs, and make more permanent positions; this can even pave the way for more a more diverse populus to occupy these roles. Professors and researchers in tenured positions need to challenge bullies, not condone their behavior; or an external system who can do more than an ombudsman needs to be put in place in every academic department. The system needs reworking, not more PhD students.",AskAcademia,A fall from the ivory tower: a story of how the academic system will work you and a call for change

PROS: no more crippling pain, no on-call hours and going to work in the middle of the night, holidays nights and weekends off. I wont have to go back to school to relearn a new skill. 

CONS: paycut of at least 10,000 a year. Probably more. Do I have to start as an assistant professor??? Im introverted and not a social creature. I can go days without having a real conversation with other people...although I would like to change this....i have anxiety  and depression sometimes. Terrified I will suck horribly and get fired.

throawaythestresspls,t2_zqc16e,2018-11-29 06:53:10,a1f12u,1,"Hey everyone, I had an academic integrity violation and would appreciate any help. I've tried speaking to my academic counsellors but they haven't been too helpful in the matter.  


So last year, I had some accommodations and extensions for my exams because I was very physically ill and had severe depression and anxiety. I had to extend the deferrals I got because my physical and mental health worsened and I was bedridden. I had to get a note from a doctor confirming this and I did. However, when I got home I realised that my doctor didn't properly acknowledge the dates I told her I was sick and wrote an incorrect date. I had a lot of anxiety with leaving my room and speaking to people at the time, so I made the dumb mistake of altering the doctor's note to the correct date myself. So after my faculty office noticed this altercation, I was booked with academic integrity violation. They were sympathetic with my circumstances, but wanted to enforce punishments for the serious offence I committed.  


While I appealed the decision to fail me in 3 of these mandatory courses, I still received sanctions on these courses. The outcome of this appeal would be for me to write these exams, but I would need a certain mark on the exam to pass the course and my grade would be capped for the courses. The whole appeal process for this took around a year, so understandably I forgot a lot about the course content and it became apparent to me that it would be extremely difficulty for me to successfully pass these exams. I had to keep rearranging exam rewrite times with my professors because of my mental health getting worse and some personal circumstances, and my professors were very understanding. If I were to fail any of these courses, I would be required to withdrawal from my program due to the academic regulations of my school.   


I've spoke to some advisers at my school about how my mental health is getting worse and I don't see myself being able to successfully write the deferred exams this semester and they told me it is not possible for me to drop these courses without academic penalty because the academic integrity panel thought they were very lenient already with my decision. For me, the best outcome would be if I were allowed to retake these courses entirely, as I'm someone who needs to be engaged in the class to learn rather than self-study for the final exam for these courses. The ombudsman recommended I propose to the counsel if I could re-enrol in these courses, but the sanctions would still be held. I'm likely going to propose this to the academic integrity panel, but there is still doubt in which if I will be able to get this request approved.  


I also did some reflection about the severity of the sanctions I got. I wanted to know from people in academia if they saw my punishment as just. I saw my actions as an action of weakness, and the panel acknowledged I had no malicious intent; but a stupid mistake. While this is an extreme example, I get extremely upset when I think of how students with criminal charges in crimes like sexual assault are allowed to finish their degree with no sanctions but I am sanctioned for a mistake that was largely rooted with my mental and physical illnesses. It will also be extremely difficult for me to pursue the jobs I want and enrol in grad school, as the grades for these courses are capped at a C for me.   


I was wondering if there are any alternatives to what I plan on proposing to the panel - which is re-enrolling in the courses with the same sanctions...I was wondering if I could convince them to drop the sanctions that would penalise my grades...Any insight or opinions would be appreciated.",AskAcademia,academic integrity violation advice please

I'm 5 years post PhD and currently in a research only position at a second tier university.  I've done okay, I have a decent track record in publications (30+ JA, 1 book, etc) and grants ($1mill+) and do a lot of internal and external service, as well as some teaching. I'm currently on a major ECR fellowship. I probably work too much, 60+ hours a week the first few years post-PhD, but have since tried to slow down and ensure I take time out. 

Despite this, I've been battling increasing states of anxiety, depression, and chronic health issues which seem to get worse the more I engage in academia. I'm finally getting one chronic illness sorted which I was hoping would help me get back on track, and then was hit with another, lifelong progressive disease that I'll be managing for the rest of my life. It almost feels like I'm trading pieces of my health for the next publication or grant. Alongside this, I feel as though my research is absolutely worthless and I shouldn't even be bothering. I stare at my screen and think ""why are you doing this, no one gives a sh*t about your work. It's not worth anything."" 

I can't focus on my project, and I feel incredibly isolated and alone in my department which I have tried to address and gotten nowhere.

I was abused as a kid (my mother was an angel during it, I have no need to but want to clarify) and have PTSD from it. Depression and anxiety since I was 11, intense suicidal urges and thoughts since 12, and ADD. School was awful but I managed to graduate with honors and got a near full ride first generation scholarship to a nice school. 

None of my mental health problems were addressed, however, so I ended up in a really bad situation and had to drop out.


They finally peaked this past March when I had a PTSD episode unlike anything I’d experienced that ended with me being admitted into a partial rehabilitation program that, quite literally, saved my life. Mentally, I am way better and although it’s still hard due to everything occurring, I finally feel alive enough to actually want to live my life and finish college. ((I include this because I’m not sure if it’s relevant to 4 year or even higher education programs when considering me, but it affected me a lot))

My problem is that my track record looks awful. 

Fall 2016- fall 2017: gap year 
Fall 2017- fall 2018: attended 4 year college for one year, ended with medical withdrawal and 2 point something GPA
Fall 2018: no classes 
Spring 2019- spring 2020: failing most classes, retaking them and passing, but repeatedly failing one math class. Spring 2020 is when I had to withdraw again due to my episode. 

I am now back at community college and my GPA is subpar at 2.5, I believe, but I’m on track to get only A’s and B’s this semester. I was aiming for all A’s but sadly don’t think that’s possible now. 

My anhedonia made it so that I wasn’t able to maintain an interest in much, but I always enjoyed learning and hearing about anatomy, how the human body works, why, etc., and am taking a biology class I’m actually interested in. All of that makes me want to pursue a career as a PA of some sort. After reading all of that I’m sure I sound insane, so I just want to know: how insane am I? 

Is it proper decorum to contact the admissions office at a PA school and see what they’d need to see from me to even consider my application? My counselor at my community college can’t tell me much besides how to get accepted into a 4 year to attend my last 2 years of school. Would I have to wait until then to see a counselor that could properly help? What can I do to make my resume look more promising? 


I’m having a lot of trouble being hopeful about the future because every time I speak to my friends (who are all very successful already), all they say is that I should be a medical interpreter (I’m bilingual, working on trilingual), or a beautician, or an esthetician, or “have you considered being a makeup artist? Your eyeliner always looks *so* good!” Which I know they only say because they want to help somehow, but it’s almost insulting at times. My interest in my looks has always been due to not feeling as if I have any purpose and was worthless so I might as well try to be pretty while taking up space; it was not because I was genuinely passionate about spending 1 &amp; 1/2 hours getting ready each day just to disappoint my teachers and mother in $45 foundation. 

I feel as if I need encouragement or advice, or even both. Anything, as I feel helpless, silly, and inept.

Long story short, my PhD started with the death of someone close to me, so getting started on a strong research project felt secondary for a few months. As such, I wasted a fair chunk of time (I only have about 3 years) just doing basic work, e.g. imlementing models in my code etc. I should mention that my project started off as a collaboration between me/my supervisor and a research group in Europe, so I have been working very closely with someone outside the university, almost as if they were a de facto second supervisor.

In January, my supervisor announced that he was leaving the university for an industry job, and that I would now be supervised by two other people at the university. We had a strange meeting between them, my supervisor, and the collaborator where my new supervisors really didn't seem interested in my project, nor did they get on well with the collaborator.

Immediately after that, the coronavirus hit and I had to move to emergency accommodation within the university. During the 6 months of isolated living I rarely interacted with my (now) supervisors. We had scheduled meetings with the collaborator that they stopped showing up to, and there has been very little guidance from them overall.

I have tried to take control of my research and gain independence, but I have personal issues such as struggling to focus working from home, the classic PhD student depression/outlook/anxiety, etc. that are getting in the way of that somewhat. As a consequence, my research has stalled somewhat and I am feeling very ready to simply drop out, take a vacation, and get on with my life. I worked hard and sacrificed a lot to get here, and I would very much like to succeed, obviously.

I have tried to reach out to my supervisors before to explain and it seems as though they say all of the right things, but nothing ever comes of it (they offer to read through materials I have to submit / set up a meeting to discuss non-research topics / etc).

I would greatly appreciate if someone who may have had a similar experience might offer some of the things that helped them, or anything like that. Hard truths / things I don't want to hear are very welcome.

Quantum_Pepsi,t2_8gsp93c4,2020-10-13 23:48:35,japfaw,1,"Hi all,

Hope everyone is doing well recently. Basically, I attended a state school and did well the first two years and beginning in my Junior Year, I took a turn for the worst. I started academically faltering and failing classes mainly due to apathy and disregard for school. I would like it to make it unequivocally clear from the outset that I am the only reason for these failures and am not trying to deflect the blame on other circumstances. After my terrible performance in Junior Year, I fell into a deep abyss of depression, mainly due to my academic failure and devolving into a bad student. I even was caught engaging in academic misconduct (cheated on an online exam) my senior year and was suspended for one academic year two classes short of graduating.

Right after the suspension was enacted, I vividly remember that I was so depressed that I lost 10 pounds in one week from not eating. Moreover, doing quotidian tasks such chatting up with friends and family and getting out of bed began to become such difficult tasks. I genuinely felt at that time my life was absolutely over and was having mildly-suicidal thoughts. However, despite all the melancholy in my head during that time period, deep in the recesses of my mind still lied the unwavering belief within myself that I possess the will power to succeed and will come back to rectify my academic situation in the form of an academic reinvention journey.

From that moment on, I was absolutely committed to reinventing myself and was firm in my decision to not capitulate on my seemingly insurmountable goal. During the suspension, I devised an academic trajectory to follow upon re-instation into my school and joined two labs to work in as a research associate. I also During the suspension, I devised an academic trajectory to follow upon re-instation into my school and engaged in a host of meaningful extracurricular activities that were instrumental in a cultivating a person of stronger ethics and character. These said activities were tutoring underprivileged students for standardized tests, habitat for humanity, helping at food banks and AmeriCorps. All of these activities were invaluable for teaching me the importance of integrity and I can confidently state that those events truly changed me for the better from the basis of an ethical viewpoint. Finally, during the suspension, I read Anslyn's Modern Phys Org and McQuarrie's PChem to stay abreast with Chemistry and also because I slowly developed a strong passion and curiosity towards Phys Org during my suspension.

Upon being reinstated in my school, I made sure I was absolutely ready to start attacking my coursework with diligence and fire off on all cylinders. I was extremely tenacious to finally avail what I had set out for myself and make my dreams become a tangible reality rather than a hypothetical prospect. I am happy to write that my reinvention journey went extremely well. I took four 20 credit hour semesters and 10 credits over one summer, resulting in 90 credits of post-bac coursework in the sciences. The courses were spread across Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology, etc. Moreover, all were at the 300-400 level and some of my chemistry courses were graduate level including Phys Org, Spectroscopic Method Structure Determination, Organic Reactions, Quantum Chemistry etc. My average GPA across all these courses was a **3.97.** I also took the GRE and got a 170 on Quant and 165 on Verbal. I took the Chemistry GRE and scored and got a 840, which is around 85th percentile. In these last several years of reinvention, I have become quite enthralled with research labs and have got 3 publications (Neurophysics, Neutron Physics, and Materials Chemistry) in good journals. Lastly, I have got several glowing letters of recommendation from my PIs, and my story has resonated with them quite well.

All in all, I am extremely satisfied myself that I managed to defeat all my issues in life and see out what I proposed for myself. I am proud to say that I looked failure in the face and said ""fuck you"", I will never ever give up on what I am relentlessly passionate about. The reality is still important not to neglect and the reality is i am 25 years young but still not enrolled in a graduate program. I am planning to apply this cycle to PhD programs in the US. I am a domestic student and intend to apply to the my home institution (state flagship ranked 30 in chemistry).

 - I don't really know this person (Hayley\*). We both applied to the same PhD program, were both accepted to work under the same PI, but only I got funding. But Hayley and I weren't even competing for the same funding and there was room for both of us in the group, so we have no ""beef"". I met her through Twitter - *she* reached out to *me* and told me she'd applied to the same program. All of our interactions have been through Twitter and they're either pleasant or neutral, but I've always gotten the feeling that she thinks she's better than me. Despite clearly both being first-year PhDs who got into competitive programs, she has repeatedly tried to give me (unsolicited) advice on conferences and publishing even though it looks like I actually have more experience in those areas. Otherwise we just like and retweet each other's stuff.

 - Hayley is more popular/well-known than I am. She has tens of thousands of followers on Twitter and is friends with people who have 100,000+, and I have ~100. Edit: she has also been interviewed, advised for popular sci-fi movies, gone on TV and radio, etc. If this becomes ""a thing"" then I think people will want to side with her or try to excuse her behaviour before they believe me. I've seen people be accused of things a bunch of times, they get absolutely piled on and abused, and then there's no real compensation when they're proven innocent and people just continue to believe the lies. I don't want to be that person; I have a history of depression and severe anxiety and I don't think I could handle it. 

 - **I think my PI likes her better.** He's talked about how great a student she is and how disappointed he was when she didn't get funding, and he doesn't give me the same praise (that I know of), which makes me feel like I was always playing second fiddle to her. He even wants us to go to the US at some point to visit her group and collaborate. I don't care if anyone else in the department/university investigates her claims just to prove they're false, but if I ask my PI for help and he starts investigating her claims as though they have *any* potential weight to them, does that mean he doesn't fully trust me? I don't think I could continue working with him if he took her word on this for even a second.

 - The page is hosted by Hayley's website (e.g. hayleysmith.com/street-hat-is-a-liar) but if I just go to her website homepage, I can't navigate to the page through any links or menus. It seems to only be accessible by direct link, but you can find that direct link if you google my name (I have a very uncommon name, probably unique). So maybe she didn't mean to publish it or doesn't think it's visible? 

 - Hayley is generally pretty polished from what I've seen online, and the page is not - it's just text, and my name is all lowercase. Maybe it's a mental illness thing? Not an excuse for what she's done, but could mean she gets sympathy and a free pass. 

 - I'm a first-year PhD who no one really knows in academia, so this could really hurt me professionally. Even if I show everyone how much of a petty, lying piece of shit she is, I'm going to look like a trouble-maker. I don't know how many people have seen the page or if she's been spreading lies on other platforms/in person.

I'm no longer seeing red about this (I'm still really pissed), but now I'm panicking. I don't know what to do. I don't know why she hates me.",AskAcademia,"[X-post r/gradschool] I'm being slandered, help"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 23 year old Canadian student, studying at a Canadian university in a specialized honours sociology bachelors program. I started school when I was 17, in 2013, but in a program I absolutely hated. My parents essentially forced me to go to school by threatening to kick me out (I wasn't financially stable due to financial abuse--but that's a whole other story, but will touch upon this later on in the post), so I enrolled into a program I thought I would like, but ended up hating it. My dad was very abusive during that year, and I was also in a very abusive romantic relationship. This is all in conjunction with suffering from diagnosed low-functioning ADHD and accompanying depression and anxiety. After my first year of university I had to feel my home because my safety was being threatened by my family. I took a year off, and then started and completed a 2 year college diploma from 2015 to April 2017. After that, I returned to university in September 2017 and decided that sociology sounds like exactly what I'd like to study after thorough research into it. I have been attending ever since, with my graduation date estimated at April 2022. Since I began university again I decided to seek help for what I was experiencing, and upon reflection of my first year of university, I realized that I may have ADHD. I have been getting help for my ADHD since then, and it has really shown. My first year of university grades consisted of two C's, a C+, and an F. However, the past two years, the lowest grade I've gotten was a B+ (gen eds), and for the last two years of school I expect to be getting no lower than A's, as I only have program specific courses left. My inquiry for this subreddit is regarding grad school applications, admissions, and the fact that it will take me 8 years to finish my bachelors. Will this affect my application? I believe that I could be successful in grad school because I have the ability to (considering my grades now), and an immense desire to. I love academia, and I especially love writing, as it's been my passion and hobby, so I believe I could do it, and it is my main goal in life currently. I'm worried that because it took me twice as long to finish a bachelors that it would affect my application and admission into a program. In Canada, most grad schools only look at the grades from the last two years of your program, but I don't know if they'd question why I took classes in 2013. I estimate that my GPA for the last two years of my program will be now lower than in the high 80's. I will also be completing an undergraduate honours thesis, as well as have references from professors in sociology.  I don't know what to do about this situation, and how I would go about explaining or justifying why it took so long. I feel extremely lost and I really need advice. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Schwarzschild_Radius,t2_en5id,2018-10-07 23:44:53,9m9wvu,1,"Any thoughts on my situation would be greatly appreciated… 

School used to be my whole life, my greatest passion. I was an A student with honors, good relationship with professors. I tutored other students. I’m currently in my last year of undergrad on a full-ride national scholarship (among other grants). The plan was to go to grad school (which I’m in a prep program for) to become an English professor, which I thought I would love and be good at, and my mentors thought so too.

But over the past year I’ve sort of let everything go to shit. . . 

I was sexually assaulted by an English prof. and mentor. I reported him and he lost his job but it didn’t go to trial. That was two years ago, and I was hanging in there, but he started stalking me on campus and writing negative things about me online last year. (I should note: he worked at my community college, not my current university.) He stands outside my dorm and classes just watching me. My Dean and Campus Security is aware, but I haven’t tried for a restraining order for lack of evidence of the stalking. In the Spring semester, I saw him nearly every day, and I was terrified to be on campus, and dropped almost all my classes. Lately, I rarely see him, but I’m still uncomfortable on campus. 

I think the stalking set something off in me though. It’s not just the anxiety of being on campus. Since he was my English prof., all of my classes now remind me of him. I can’t stay focused on any assignment. Even minor readings have become difficult but my workload is usually multiple novels a week. But worst of all, I’m starting to realize I’m afraid of the classroom environment now. My former professor was highly manipulative and his classes were absolutely nerve-wracking – he was **exactly** like [Terrence Fletcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yL-avlEsg&amp;frags=pl%2Cwn) in [*Whiplash*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDAsABdkWSc&amp;frags=pl%2Cwn)*.* Before every class, I am filled with excruciating anxiety; no matter how nice the professors, I still expect them to scream and throw things and humiliate students in front of everyone and keep me after class to grill me or mess with me, like he did. I don’t think I’m the same anymore. I’ve always been proud of my writing ability, but even this very post – which should be so simple – is making me cringe.

So, here’s how I’ve screwed up over the past year: Last fall, I was hospitalized after a surgery toward the end of the semester, and I received an Incomplete in two classes for which I owed assignments. The professors were laid-back and so I took my time doing the assignments well while I recovered (I’m a bit of a perfectionist and I felt I owed them **perfect** assignments because they graciously gave me extensions). But then the stalking began, and I spiraled into a deep depression and let deadline after deadline pass by. I was convinced I had to quit because this field was forever ruined for me. The rare days I did have motivation, I did my work well, and I still squeaked by with mostly A’s.. But I still had to drop a couple classes. Even though I was terribly depressed and hopeless, I managed to obtain an opportunity for summer research in the hopes that I would begin to feel better and push through and be able to apply for grad school this fall. 

I didn’t get better. I never finished my last two papers for the Incomplete grades and they lapsed to F’s. I barely managed any research over the summer and that’s sitting on the back-burner with an extension. Some point around the beginning of the summer I decided that this dream of mine (to become a professor) was doomed and, because that’s all I thought I was meant to do, that I was going to kill myself. I stopped doing everything because I could barely write a sentence or get through a chapter of a book. I stopped talking to my professors. I changed my mind, as you can see. I signed up for classes last-minute. But my scholarship was consequently delayed and I didn’t money for books and I barely have food and I saw the former professor on campus again. Some profs/mentors were convinced that if I turned in the papers, though it’s not supposed to work this way, my other professors would change my grades from the lapsed F’s. But I never finished those either. So, the stress of everything on my back-burner is making me struggle in the current classes. I’m terrified to go to class most days.  With my former professor, if I missed an assignment or a class, I was guaranteed to be screamed at or humiliated in class or fucked with after class. Logically, I know my current professors won’t do that, but when I’m so stressed and depressed, the possibility is too overwhelming.

So, right now, I have 2 F’s, my absences in my current classes have put me on a track to failure, and I still have a research project from the summer to do. My scholarship runs out this year. To graduate with my Bachelor’s, I need to have those F’s changed, pass these current classes, finish the research project, and fill up and succeed in my next two terms of school. 

I think I’m a good student. I’ve written a 30-page A+ paper in one night. Last semester, I wrote my final paper in a few hours on a cellphone in a car on the way to a concert 300 miles away and received an A. If I was doing well, these things would be no sweat. And furthermore, I would love it. I thoroughly enjoyed school. I used to look forward to class. Writing papers used to be thrilling. And all I wanted to do was teach. No matter how hard a struggle, I still help my fellow students when the opportunity arises.

What do you all think? Should I drop out? Has this career path been ruined? Can I salvage this? How do I talk to my professors? I can’t exactly say, “sorry I missed so much class, I’ve been depressed and stressed out.” That’s not an excuse. I can’t exactly say, “please accept my ultra-late paper; life has been hard.” Ideally, I want to continue on the path I was once on; I want to rekindle my passion and my dream and reclaim the classroom environment, but I think, practically,  I need to at least finish my Bachelor’s. I was given this incredible opportunity with my scholarships (otherwise school wasn’t even a possibility) and I can’t just throw it away. I can worry about grad school later if that’s something I choose to do. But even the smallest things – simple assignments and just attending class, and especially communicating these things with my professors – seem so impossible these days.",AskAcademia,Recovering from the seeming point of no return?

I graduated from UMD psych program couple of years back. Due to financial and life reasons I had to work for a bit before returning to complete my masters. I am currently volunteering at a research lab and working as an ABA therapist. 
I am looking to apply to NYU- UMD and potentially some Cali schools. NYU and UMD are safe bets (I had an informal interview at NYU and they said with research experience I'd have no problems getting in) but I'd really like to relocate and since I want to move to california after graduating either way I figured it makes sense to apply to schools there to begin with.

I am looking to do a masters in counseling but I'm afraid I'm getting a bit overwhelmed trying to catch up with my lack of knowledge on the professional side of things (im the first person in my family to even attend college let alone pursue masters/doctorate etc)

I basically want to focus on 1 on 1 therapy and focus on depression or couples/relationship therapy. As I understand counseling would be the correct program for me as opposed to something like clinical psych.

We'd talked for about an hour and he assured me that if I showed up, he'd like to hire me. It seems like a non-stressful position, just calling people and asking them to create a bank account.

I don't know how seriously I should take that, since like I feel like every time I apply to a job they act like they're going to give it to me - but I'm tempted to try. The thing is, my last work experience was disasterous.

The other thing was - this was just a part time position. I was also doing full time school, but I just ended up doing horrible at both school and work. This is the year I'm retaking most of the courses I ended up dropping/failing that year. I just don't want to revert back to what I was that year and spend another year undoing the stupid mental and academic damage. I'm trying to apply for a masters in my fifth year, but if I screw up again, then that won't be an option.

I was working in a fast food cafe, it's basically one kitchen for subway, pizza pizza, and a bunch of other fast food giants. That year and the year before it, i was sort of just slowly building myself up from some stuff. I thought i could go to work, something I was sure was beyond me in highschool.

At first I loved it, I loved being on cashier. My manager told me to talk to people while I dealed with them, which i loved doing, I loved seeing them smile, and getting them to laugh - but whenever my manager came near me I'd instinctively feel guilty.

A remnant of the broken me from before, but i felt like I was stealing money from her basically. I can't describe the irrationality that goes into death, grief and depression, but all of highschool I was pretty convinced I wasn't entitled things I wanted. I still felt guilty when I ate food, when i invited people over, when my dad looked at me, there was always guilt tied into it, Someone else could have eaten it, forcing them to be around me through pity, or someone else should have been here instead.

Whenever she was near I'd start stuttering basically, and she'd get really mad. That happened two more times (once i even admitted that she made me nervous, at which she became furious telling me not to blame my problems on her) After christmas, most of which i spent dreading going back, she pulled me aside to tell me that she tried not to judge people by their work performance and that she was going to give me another chance in the kitchen.

At this point my fears were validated. I worked in the kitchen, it was more manual than anything so I could at least ignore everyone else, but whenever someone called my name I would freak the fuck out, jump a foot into the air, and drop whatever I was holding. They were all really nice, and they'd hide whatever fuckups I created, but they treated me like a child and I couldn't blame them.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in dire need of your assistance. I have always been an academically-focused individual as far back as grade school. I come from an impoverished Black family. Everyone believed that I go to college. Everyone believed that I would do great things. Being ""smart"" was only saving grace.  Also, I went to public schools in the ghetto so getting good grades... wasn't that difficult. Moving onto HS, at the end of my freshmen year, I was placed in the IB program where I remained until graduation. The curriculum was intense enough that I actually had to put in effort. And I did, maintaining a B average in most of my classes.

&amp;#x200B;

Tragedy struck when I was then evicted from my home in my Junior year. My family was split up, my mother staying in a shelter and my sister with a friend. From that point onward, I spent most of my time living from basement-to-basement through the generosity of friends. As a result, the years of academic excellence that I strived to obtain came crashing down. I stayed home from school. I stopped doing homework. I scored poorly on the SAT (1110 of 1600). I didn't apply to colleges. I stopped caring about the future. At that point in my life, I underwent a severe depression where I believed there was no place in the future for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Flashforward 3 years, I'm doing slightly better. I've worked mediocre jobs and saved up a few hundred dollars... However, I do not wish to continue living my life this way. All of my peers are almost finished with their bachelors... and I have nothing to show for it. Right now, I'm sleeping on Grandma's couch, a step away from homelessness.  I feel like... everyone had so many expectations of me, both family and professors... and I let everyone down. So what I need from you all... is guidance.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I spend two years in community college and then transfer to a four-year university? 

I have no way to pay for tuition... Would it be possible to obtain a full-ride despite not being a student? I am heavily against taking out loans as I do not wish to spend my 30s and 40s paying them off...

&amp;#x200B;

Should I retake the SAT and try to score in the 1500-1600 range? Will I be able to obtain a full-ride scholarship then?

&amp;#x200B;

My passion lies in acting and music... But those are both long term investments. For the present, I need something concrete that will produce results. What do you think would be the best route for me? Please share your experiences going back to school as I would love to hear them.

My concern isn't for her mental health nor wellness, but more the fact that she uses these problems as license to be very very awful to everyone.

I currently am about 1.5 years into my Postdoc and really hating it. After finishing my PhD (with great results, 4 papers) I naturally decided  the next best step is a postdoc. Sadly I was wrong. While the beginning of my post doc i did some great analysis and produced some great results. I still have not produced any publications (only 1 papers submitted with major revision) and me and my supervisor barely communicate. We rarely meet up to discuss anything about me or my progress as he is never around, and when he is he is too busy talking to others, or making time for other postdocs.

It has gotten worse when my supervisor hired new postdocs and is throwing all opportunities at them (He includes them in grants, higher pay than me, has promoted them, given them students to supervise etc. all within 8 months of them starting). I have been here 1.5 years and I never got this treatment when I started, I am still baffled as to why their starting salaries are much higher then my own starting salary (even though we have similar number of publications before we started the postdoc).

Following all this, I am currently suffering serious depression and stress and constantly lack motivation as i have many issues in my personal life. I feel empty inside, worthless and just not good enough. I have isolated myself from all my colleagues (causing them to not talk to me or invite me to anything, coffee, drinks, lunch, dinners etc).

ThrowawayAcademic234,,2018-07-02 18:58:35,8vl91o,1,"Disclaimer: I’m a STEM PhD student at an R01 University. This post is intended to facilitate discussion; I don’t want to attack anyone personally or anyone’s life choices. I make no attempt to suppress my opinions, but I make every attempt to support them with data. I can only speak to my personal experience in grad school. I can’t speak for the humanities at all, although from what I understand they have an even worse position than STEM grad students.

**My argument is that** **in today’s job market, it’s unethical to lure students into PhD programs****.** The reasoning behind this is simple: there are no more tenure track jobs, and so grad school is no longer worth it. 

PhD’s can get other jobs, yes, but we’ll get to that later. I think the loss of tenure track jobs is more of an existential threat to the structure of grad school than people realize.

**Grad school used to be worth it, but isn’t anymore**

Grad school is basically an apprenticeship. You agree to work for six years (on average in biology) of difficult, stressful, highly technical work for low pay, in exchange for “valuable experience” and a degree. A six year “pause” in your career is an ENORMOUS opportunity cost. Six years of potential career advancement, raises, and work/life balance.

This used to be worth it. Why? Because a tenure track job is a sweet deal: a comfortable middle class lifestyle without middle class drudgery. The chance to obtain tenure, and basically never be fired. Good pay. Good benefits. Excellent flexibility. The opportunity to study whatever you’d like, provided you can get funding. The rewards were obvious, and so the crappy grad school experience is worth it.

But then tenure track jobs disappeared. Today only &lt;10&amp;#37; of biology PhDs go on to obtain tenure-track jobs (https://bit.ly/2MIuJ1j). That means &gt;90&amp;#37; of new PhDs will fail to obtain the “gold standard” job most people want.

**PhDs are not financially worth it, and don’t prepare you for real jobs**

So what to new PhD’s go off and do? Most (70&amp;#37;) do a postdoc, the “default next step” after a PhD. Postdocs are terrible. Doing a postdoc can cost you 20&amp;#37; (!!!) of your earning potential over the next 15 years ([https://bit.ly/2iYReS8](https://bit.ly/2iYReS8)). When postdocs enter the job market (as most postdocs eventually must, because tenure track jobs don’t exist) they find that their 4.5 years of postdoc experience aren’t nearly as valuable as an equivalent amount of job experience.

But of course, you don’t have to do a postdoc. And even if you do, eventually you’ll enter the job market. Most PhDs find that they haven’t been trained to make a career transition. At all. All that time you spent mastering your experimental techniques doesn’t help. Grad students don’t get job interview training, leadership training, or teamwork training. Not even a primer on LinkedIn. This results in a needlessly long job search, further worsening the already bad financial situation that 6 years of grad school have cost you.

But eventually, you get a job. The employment statistics are good: PhDs go unemployed lower than the national average. And PhDs do have a variety of job options: from industry to government to completely non-science related. Usually those jobs pay well. So it’s all worth it, right?

Financially, not really. Six to ten years after graduation, PhDs make no more money on average than their non-PhDs ([https://go.nature.com/2KugIaP](https://go.nature.com/2KugIaP)). And there isn’t much of an increase in job satisfaction either. 

Even if PhD’s did get paid more, the increased salary would have to match or exceed the six years of stagnant wages, *plus the compound interest* that higher wages (and thus more investment) would have earned you. That compound interest ends up being enormous. Most PhDs never recover financially from grad school, let alone a postdoc

**“The intangibles”**

This is usually where the argument bogs down, because numbers are hard to come by. People already know that grad school isn’t a good financial investment (although I don’t think most people realize how bad it actually is). But most people don’t go to graduate school to make money. Most people go to graduate school to pursue their passion for research, and you can’t put a price tag on passion.

PhD programs love this argument. “The intangibles” are the main draw to academia: a life of curiosity, passion, and meaning. Nobody necessarily tells you this outright when you’re applying to grad school, but it’s the underlying story behind every conversation: “Don’t worry: the intangibles make it all worth it.” 

This is actually true for some people. Some people just love research. They’re willing to make all the sacrifices: terrible work/life balance, low pay, and limited career advancement, etc. I get the feeling that some people just tell themselves “it’s all worth it” so they can fall asleep at night, but I’ve also met some true believers. They exist. 

But many people (I’d argue most, but I’m biased) don’t find passion, meaning, or purpose in grad school. Grad school is almost tailor-made to produce burnout. New students enter their programs full of passion, which is systematically beaten out of them over the next six years. 

**Grad school is a mental health crucible**

Grad students are SIX times more likely to experience anxiety and depression than the general population ([https://bit.ly/2Nk13J2](https://bit.ly/2Nk13J2)). Almost half of bioscience grad students are depressed. And no wonder: grad students face a noxious cocktail of stress for years, including :

1. **Terrible work/life balance**. The sheer amount of time you need to spend in lab can be overwhelming. It’s often not realistic to balance the demands of work with exercise, sleep, fun, etc. 

2. **Social isolation**. This depends on the lab, but I know many grad students who spend much of their time alone. Students can spend weeks sitting in a dark microscope room, or pipetting by themselves. Some people might enjoy this, but even the most introverted introvert needs social interaction sometimes.

3. **Excruciating critiques**. Ah, committee meetings. I have these every six months, and it boils down to 6 faculty members telling me that I wasted the last six months of work.

4. **The effort/reward disconnect**. This is actually a huge one. There’s an entire model in psychology that argues that “effort/reward imbalance” (basically, an environment in which tons of effort can result in absolutely no reward) is the main reason people are stressed out and  dissatisfied at work. This is just one review ([https://bit.ly/2NktgiL](https://bit.ly/2NktgiL)) that shows effort/reward imbalance at work can tank your immune system. Personally: my PhD has been nothing but failed experiments and negative results, and my life is waaaay worse as a result.

**So are PhD programs unethical? (the “it’s a choice” argument)**

So, I’ve done my best to prove that 1. There’s no guaranteed reward after grad school 2. PhD’s never really make up the money they’ve lost, and aren’t prepared for “real-world” jobs and 3. The promised intellectual satisfaction, passion, and freedom touted by grad-school recruiters is often impossible to find.

 But just because grad school sucks and probably isn’t worth it, are PhD programs unethical?

I, obviously, would argue yes.

I’ve had this argument, and the main defense I encounter is “We don’t force people to come to grad school”. After all, nobody holds a gun to a prospective student’s head and forces them to come to grad school. It’s a choice.

That’s true. Nobody forced me to come to grad school. But nobody really told me the truth about it either. If universities told the truth about grad school, I don’t think nearly as many people would come.

Universities need grad students. Grad students are the ones doing the actual research at universities. Without grad students, universities would lose millions and millions of dollars in funding. IMO, universities will do *whatever it takes* to recruit enough cheap grad student labor to power their labs. 

I think universities know that grad school is a terrible move for most students, but they accept increasing numbers of new PhD student anyway. Universities know about academic job prospects. They know that students are unprepared for the job market. They know that grad students experience burnout and depression at record rates. *Universities* *know all this,* and are relying on young, idealistic science students to make a mistake and come to grad school. 

And that, IMO, is why PhD programs are unethical.

This ended up being waaaay longer than I intended, and also more rant-laden. Again, I’m not trying to attack anyone personally. Most of the faculty, students, staff, etc. I’ve met in grad school are fantastic people. But if you put fantastic people in a corrupt, rigged system, they’ll do corrupt, rigged things.",AskAcademia,Are PhD programs unethical in today's job market?

This was largely due to my sisters suicide attempts during the first semester which took a massive toll on me because of how hard it was to be so far away from my home while all of this was going on. Heading into this semester my sluggishness/depression carried over, and got increasingly worse as I lost any academic confidence I had. I turned the quarter at the midway point of this semester as I was re-prescribed Adderall for my ADHD, and I partially kicked out of the depressive sluggish state I was in, and have finally gotten into a real good groove academically for what feels like the first time in my life.

This course hasn't had much work to complete, and the main reason for the grade was due to a poor midterm exam grade (11/30, 30% of total grade, which was shocking because I thought I at least did decently on it with the amount of studying I put into it), and attendance issues from the first month and a half of the semester.

bely_medved13,t2_5q9wn7bo,2020-02-22 00:21:21,f7khy5,1,"TLDR - I slid into a period of moderate depression in the early stages of dissertation writing (in the humanities).  I'm falling further and further behind and struggling to focus and get organized through the negative thoughts and fatigue.  How do you manage intensive research (particularly in the humanities) with depression?  

Hi reddit! I'm an advanced PhD student in literature/modern languages in the early stages of dissertation writing.  Grad school has been somewhat of a roller coaster for me, but until now, I've managed to be pretty productive, meet all of my program's mileposts for earning the degree, and for the most part have found the process to be rewarding.  However, I struggle from ADHD, which can create focus issues that occasionally lead to low-grade depression. Although I've somehow managed these symptoms and turned in quality work in the past, I have faltered while transitioning into the dissertation stage.  

Last semester I had a pretty intensive teaching load, and had to be on campus and in the classroom 5 days a week.  It was also a class full of difficult, under-motivated students, including one who was sexually harassing me. At the same time I was trying to complete my prospectus so I can start on the actual fun research for my dissertation.  Due to my issues with organization and focus, I always struggle during the beginning stages of larger research projects, but the stress from teaching caused my research productivity to grind to a halt.  Although I was spending large amounts of time in the library and reading, I struggled to actually find and retain the information I needed to finish the prospectus.  I ended up having to delay my prospectus defense, which is the first time I've failed to meet a major program milestone in time.

I was hoping that the new semester would offer me a fresh start and new focus, but unfortunately that hasn't been the case.  Instead, I've slid into a state of mental chaos and fatigue, which are fueled by low grade depression.  Reading takes me 2-3 times as long as usual due to issues with focus, I'm exhausted all the time, and I'm struggling to complete even basic research tasks.  Naturally, my inability to complete things makes my depression and negative thinking patterns worse.  I'm not sure how to manage the research process while I'm in this state.  Everything about it is so painfully slow that it feels I will never finish, and it is embarrassing to face my advisor when I haven't produced anything.  

I'm on antidepressants and see a therapist fairly regularly.  I'm also trying to implement better organizational systems, although this is an ongoing process.   I find that I'm able to get the teaching duties done because I have to face my students every day, but the intangible and open-ended nature of humanities research is so much harder to manage.   I've considered the possibility that this isn't the right career path for me, but I'm passionate about my dissertation topic and want to at least try to write one chapter before I decide on a career shift.  But I need to finish the prospectus before that can happen, and that task feels impossible right now.

Murphy129129,t2_2sunz8n9,2018-12-17 01:15:42,a6v04g,1,"A'right, I will give some background:

I'm currently a fifth year part-time PhD Candidate whose research area is niche (meaning, it's small interdisciplinary community). I am close to finishing a draft of my dissertation. 

I have been working with Supervisor A, I'll call them, for almost 4 years. Our relationship started out awkwardly. I introduced myself on email and asked if they would be interested in my project while sending out applications. I then followed this up a year later through an appointment with them. My mistake (and I totally acknowledge this) was assuming they could still be my supervisor.

It was an awkward first meeting, I was told to drop out, but contested this because I had well the first year.

Second year comes along and I do stellar on my comps, am working on my first conference paper, and submit a proposal deemed excellent. Also won a scholarship.

Our relationship had sustained itself somewhat through the year. We had monthly meetings for updates. They went on a short sabbatical at the end of my third year during which my comp exam committee member took the role of standing supervisor.

I got on well with my comps committee member. Admired their work and their advice. Conversations about my work and my progress were beneficial, even a boost when the chips were down.

Supervisor A comes back, I submit chapter 1 and 2 and have a meeting for both at separate times. By this time my comps comm member was a co-supervisor.

The second meeting went terrible. Supervisor A was cutting and at time aggressive, even in front of Supervisor B. I avoided throwing insult for insult, but the whole ordeal was completely out of context (the chapter required some amendments and a new introduction) and I must've looked pretty irritated because the news got around.

Leading up to the second meeting (6 months or so), I found single meetings with Supervisor A getting more ... awkward (in the sense that they felt hostile, but more lowkey hostile, dismissive, etc). I had won two scholarships since the original, taught quite a bit, and went to several conferences. In one meeting, my supervisor (out of the blue) asked me if my 'parents were still alive.' I answered 'yes,' but was confused at the question, since it had no context. Another meeting it wad implied I was 'crazy' and outright stated they 'couldn't wait to see (me) out of the uni.' Once again, no context. Just a regular meeting about the work. 

Hostilities are unpredictable at this point. Supervisor A gives good feedback, but I find, if I'm to be honest, it almost impossible to be in a room with them. I don't receive quality anything outside of the page from them.

On the other hand, Supervisor B has maintained support. I had a meeting with them about the issue with A, they provided full support, even concern for it's effect on my health, since I was noticeably depressed for a few months. In fact, this negative relationship has nearly put me into a deep depression and has, albeit temporary, affected my progress and desire to research, which I loved.

Any advice? I'm in fifth year and will be finishing up this draft in the coming year with a target defence date early 2020. I've managed excellent standing so far in the program and friends have encouraged me to drop A, despite some of their research area colliding with mine.

Over the summer I started to skip behind. My partner and I had money troubles so I took a part-time job to earn some money. This was always part of the plan - my funding doesn’t cover anywhere near my living expenses so it was always on the cards. 

I got an apparently reliable job. But, because it was the summer there were fewer hours available. My manager promised me the max hours that I’m allowed come term time, but until then there were only two hours a day available. They didn’t have anyone else’s working. It was strongly implied if I didn’t do these hours, there were no more coming in term time. I did them. Problem was, my commute is longer than the two hours I was working, and took up one of the hours’ pay. I was losing 10-3 every single day and I still wasn’t making enough to live on. We blew through savings at an alarming rate, but term was round the corner.

Term time came and I wasn’t given more hours. Panic set in.

I was repeatedly supported by professors to continue on with my education. So I did. I went to a great school in my country (Canada), where I just graduated with an MA in Theatre Studies. I love my field, and I love my area of research, which is digital theatre. So the logical step was to apply to doctoral programs. I reached out to several professors in the UK, and Australia and my proposal was generally well received. So far, I have found a supervisor who loves my project at a school in the UK, and the committee handling acceptances has ""praised my proposal"". I still have a few months to apply to a few programs in Canada, but I'm afraid to keep going down this path.

I studied English, after switching from history. I had seminars of 12 people in lecturers' offices no bigger than an average garden shed, a seven-hour a week timetable for 17 weeks a year, unfriendly and rarely available lecturers and tedious, rambling lectures.

University was like experiencing the shock of retirement, suddenly having hours and hours of free time to fill. The boredom and apathy that a seven-hour week induces should not be underestimated.

Having originally had hopes of a first, and marks that suggested it was possible, I eventually became de-motivated and apathetic.

If I'd got a third I would still have felt mostly relief at finishing. In my final year I had, in almost half of my 20 weeks of teaching, five hours or fewer of teaching. This is in a four-day week. Some students in my department had a three-day week.

The dearth of lectures and seminars meant they really would have had to be of a high standard to make the whole experience worthwhile, but this was not the case.

One elderly tutor would ramble, eyes shut, for an hour in a way only loosely connected with the subject; one told us that seminars were all about what we could teach each other (which raised the question of what exactly she was being paid for) and left us to it; and one likeably eccentric man would hold forth on where the best tailors could be found in Modena, and other sundry irrelevant subjects.

In my three years, only two of my courses had well-run, productive, interesting seminars where there was genuine debate and interest.

When perusing league tables, remember that they bear little relation to actual life at the university. I was taught in the English and history departments, which are rated top ten nationally. Yet I had to put up with bad organisation, paltry feedback and some incompetently led seminars. If the league tables and assessments are accurate, and Warwick really is one of the best, then national standards must be at a scandalous low.

I suspect that good performance in league tables betrays, in fact, a prioritisation of points-chasing over teaching. Certainly Warwick never misses an opportunity to get lecturers on the radio or in the papers while little is done about student depression.

The universities that are ranked highly can get away with such a small amount of teaching because they can select the students they want, meaning that the people that get in are those that don't need much teaching.

This can clearly be seen in the difference between the popular humanities, in which a ten-hour week is unusually full, and less popular science courses like engineering where struggling students receive plenty of contact time and even extra coaching.

So what lesson can be drawn? My three years at Warwick University were a waste of time. Had I known at the start what I know now I would have dropped out. If you start university and don't like the lecturers, people and culture, drop out. Go and do something that you enjoy and are enthused by.

My advisor has consistently been awful to me and treated me like crap this semester. I have two weeks to finish all my work for the paper I need to write for him and I don’t have any of the information I need and I’m running out of time but  struggling to find any motivation. Plz help

I’m in my last semester of my undergrad in physics. I was accepted into my top choice grad program and will be attending in the fall. I’m very excited but in order to make that happen I need to actually finish this degree. 

I have had anxiety and depression all throughout my college career, and I’m doing all I can to treat it. Now, the semester was going really well, I was on top of my studies, my research/capstone project, and I was happy, until the school shut down. Now, I, along with everyone else on this sub I’m sure, has to work from home. I’ve never been able to get work done in my house, I live in a house in the town next to campus with my best friends, she’s the best roommate I could ask for. But we don’t have desks in the house that we rent, as it is very small and there’s literally no room. We work at the dinning table, but the chairs are awful and we ultimately end up distracting each other. She also suffered from multiple mental health issues so neither of us have been in a hood place and have been spiraling. We are also under state-mandated quarantine bc we were with out families out of state over break, and recently moved back into our house. So we can’t go and get anything to help, nor can we go anywhere to study. 

It is now to a point where I have 2 weeks to finish my capstone project. Now I have always struggled with research and computational projects, but it’s the only area of research in the department that interests me (I do astrophysics things) and the professor I work under I have known since my second semester of college and I wanted to work with him. So me and one other student started working with this professor and he was always the Star child. I always struggled and fumbled through and certain things with computers give me severe anxiety. In the past few months I have been slowly overcoming the anxiety around computers and was kind of on pace up until shit hit the fan in March. 

Now bc I can’t work, can’t escape, and am trapped with someone who is even more mentally spirals than I am, I haven’t been able to get anything done. Getting out of bed takes literal hours, the only thing I feel that helps is do my hobbies like cooking and knitting, but that’s not helping me getting a degree. We had a group zoom meeting and my advisor set strict goals for me to reach by Friday (tomorrow) and for the following days. I haven’t been able to do any of it bc I am spiraling so hard. It also doesn’t help that I keep getting the objectives changed so on me by my advisor, constantly being spoken over by my advisor and the other member of the group, and am constantly left out of important emails so I don’t get the information I need. I have absolutely no motivation to do anything and that is in part from my personal state of being at the time which I’m trying to control, but also because I have lost all respect from my advisor over this semester because he has consistently treated me like I’m the scum of the earth. I need to graduate but I literally have no idea what I’m doing or how I’m even supposed to start the process to meet the deadlines.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a new PhD candidate, working on four long-term projects: two manuscripts from my Master's research, a proposal for my upcoming PhD research, and a collaborative short communication manuscript (aka, natural history note). All of these tasks have deadlines months in the future (or no deadline) and are self-paced. My struggle is that because I'm not *finishing* anything, I feel like I'm not *accomplishing* anything even if I'm making progress. This sometimes triggers episodes of crushing depression and worry that I won't meet my deadlines. Exacerbating the issue is that when I do feel like I accomplish something, the feeling is fleeting because I forget what I've accomplished. Out of sight, out of mind, as they say.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I disclose my unique family circumstances and history of mental illness in my application? They affected my school performance and extracurricular, but I don't want to be penalized for my experiences or to come across like they're excuses. 

I graduated from an interdisciplinary science program at a Canadian university in 2017. I want to return to school in the next 2 years, in the field of Political Ecology/Environmental Studies, and already I'm concerned about writing my application.

I have a unique family history: in ninth grade my father's psychiatrist rapidly changed his medications and induced a psychotic break which landed my dad in the hospital and then the following year my mother was beaten (nearly to death) by the police in my hometown. We didn't have close family to support us, so needless to say both these events had an immense toll of my life and my health. My mother has severe PTSD and, although I haven't been properly diagnosed, my counsellor thinks I do too. 

When I went away to university I began having panic attacks, symptoms of depression and other mental health challenges. I found an extraordinary program I loved, but I definitely withheld and isolated myself. I wasn't involved in extracurriculars and volunteer work the way I had been in high school. My grades weren't terrible but they weren't great either (B+ average). Overall my life was characterized by fear, though I didn't understand that at the time, predominately due to the stigma surrounding both experiences (i.e. severe mental health problems and police brutality). 

Fast forward to now, I've been out of school for about 1.5 years and I'm considering applying to grad school. I always intended to pursue my Masters, but I decided I needed some time first. I've had an incredible job and work environment since I graduated, and it's helped me develop a healthy lifestyle and routine. I am better at taking care of myself, respecting my boundaries and managing my time. Still I am worried about not having a robust enough academic average or application overall. I've broken it down into two chunks: 

\- I'm having a hard time assessing my academic experiences. My grades weren't spectacular and I didn't do co-op or much volunteering in the field I'm interested in. Still I did work as a research assistant for a respected prof in Geography (if the paper is accepted I'll have a co-author credit), worked on a 40-page team capstone research project, and turned a research project into a mixed-media gallery piece, per the advice of my prof. Still I don't know if this is enough to make up for my not-excellent average. 

\- Additionally I'm unsure whether or not, and to what extent, to disclose my family experiences. On the one hand they affected me and my work capacity profoundly, and I'd like to give an explanation for a) not being more involved and b) not going straight to grad school so I don't appear lazy/unengaged. I've worked really hard to unlearn my unhealthy coping habits and I do think I'd do better in a Masters program than I did my undergrad. Pragmatically however I don't know what to disclose or whether any disclosure might be weighed against me, either as indicative that I wouldn't work hard or read as an excuse for poor work ethic etc. I don't think I actually have a poor work ethic, I have a skewed perception of my capabilities and talents. 

I know my situation is unique, but if anyone can help me de-tangle this mess I'd be so appreciative!

I will give context that I think is important, but may sound out of place for this sub. My problem is about my studies but the reasons are more personal, so if you think this would be better suited to another sub, feel free to point it out.

I grew up in a dysfunctional family, with one mentally sick (and untreated) parent, and in environments that weren't traumatizing but which I would call miserable and in which I was isolated. This led to huge socializing problems and several depressions during my studies.

I was a good student in high school without doing anything, tried to motivate myself for the two years of preparatory classes (main way of getting into grad schools in France), but quickly stopped working because of my personal problems, lack of sense of purpose, social isolation and the pressure put on me by teachers. I spent the prep classes not working and got into my current school, which is software development-oriented. While it offers a decent formation, I can't call it anything but subpar, and it has no appeal to any interesting employer. I slowly accepted that I was in a school much worse than what I could have gotten and that I wouldn't have the opportunities I would have liked.

I just got home from an Erasmus semester at one of the top universities in Europe, doing machine learning and theoretical CS, meeting people from their countries' best schools and institutes, and getting courses which interested me more than what I could have dreamed of at my home school, and I can't accept my situation anymore. I feel like my studies have been stolen from me, and while I realized how much I missed on, I slowly got into a clinical depression I'm still getting out of. I also started to hate everything about my life in my home country, and definitely don't want to stay here longer than I need to.

All I want now is to climb up. I want to switch to a more theoretical degree, in a better institution, and go towards a research engineer's position in machine learning or statistics. And while I've read and heard lots of people say that rankings don't matter as long as one does what they want, I strongly disagree and refuse to let go without doing all I can to get a reputable degree. This is as much a personal problem as a practical one; I want the same opportunities as my friends who did better schools.

I definitely feel that I'm growing up, and getting interested in fields I didn't care much about before my exchange. I'm also getting more motivated, but worrying that maybe I've waited too long and will have to do with the disappointing degree I am in. I am one year and a half from finishing my master's (with a data science major), and don't see how I could get a better degree after that, except by doing a PhD. This is an interesting option, but I'm not yet sure if it would be adequate for me.

Another option I am considering is finishing my master's in France, then trying to get into a better foreign university's master program, with a statistics or machine learning major. I don't know how selection would work in that case. I am ready to work on maths on the side to catch up with the required level, but have no idea how I could prove that I'm fit for such a program with only my degree from a low-ranked school to show.

To give a little more information, I am a 4th year undergrad with one semester left until I graduate with a BS in Psychology in the United States. I have been considering medical school since high school and started off pursuing premed. My first year of undergrad I was in engineering because everyone told me that was the best fit and I stupidly listened. My second year I switched to biology because my advisor said it was the best option for premed. During this year I also became severely depressed and figured I wasn’t good enough to be an MD and quit premed. During that year I also figured out that I’m good at psychology without much effort and decided to finish school with a psych major. I have now come to realize that my failure in biology was from my depression (triggered by losing every single friend I had when I broke up with my boyfriend of the time), not my intelligence. I believe I could succeed in medical school and I have the motivation to go, but I no longer meet the requirements. My GPA is about a 3.3 and I have a C and 2 BCs on my academic record. I also need to complete 4 more classes before I can take the MCAT and apply (OChem lab, Physics 1, Physics 2, Biochem). 
My advisor has been less than helpful and told me give up on the idea of Medical School and not to bother getting a masters. Even when I told her I was getting a masters, she wouldn’t discuss the application process with me and showed me careers instead. 
I recently applied to get my MSW (Master of Social Work) and am applying to the Title IVE program which would pay the tuition and living costs. I did this because I cannot find an enjoyable job with only a BS in Psych. I was thinking I could apply to medical school after my MSW?

My commute is long, over an hour each way with a mix between bike and light rail, and the only time I'll have 'off' is Sunday and Monday morning, in which I'll have to go food shopping, prep my food for the week, do laundry, go to the bank, clean the house, and do the homework for the week. 

I feel like I'm going to throw up. I can't do it. I don't know how it's possible for me to do it, but I also don't know how to change it. I need to work to afford my bills, but I also need to take these two classes to get into grad school. I will have no time for anything at all, not even my fiancee, who already has a worse commute than me and is out of the house for almost as long. I will barely be able to save anything to move to the graduate college are if I do get in. 

But I'm 30. I don't want to slog through minimum wage jobs for the rest of my life. It's already unbearable. I don't feel like I can postpone any of this without giving up hope. I've been low for a long time. 

What can I do? My dream has always been to get my doctoral degree and be in research, either at a university or museum, or work for the state... and eventually become a professor. I can't imagine my life without that goal. But my stress is so high that I feel like giving up on life in general. I've even started taking anxiety/depression meds a few weeks ago because I feel like I'm dying. Brain-fog, nausea, not getting out of bed, I can't make a single decision... I feel hopeless. 

How do I solve this problem? I'm going to burnout if I keep this schedule. I just want to be great in my field, but I won't even be able to focus on learning if I do this... but how will I make money???

Roughly half a year ago, when I joined the lab in new graduate institution, I got into this new project which is pretty much unrelated to most work my PI does (mostly HPC, Computer Architecture and Optimization and the like). I guess he wanted to diversify his research areas and since me and the others (3 of us, including me: 2 MSc, 1 undergrad) had more experience on signal processing than on CA and the low-level work everyone else on the lab worked on it would be a great opportunity to dive into this field which has gotten a lot of attention in the recent years.

At the beginning I was struggling with depression and a heavy breakup which combined with the fact that at the beginning I wasn't so on board with the idea of continuing graduate studies after undergrad (I was burned out and wanted to get a job in industry) and some classes which were pretty difficult for me (I studied MechEng not CS as undergrad so I have had to put a huge amount of effort to catch up with my peers) almost made me quit halfway through the semester but through friends, family and his support I managed to keep everything under control and finish the semester outstandingly.

During all of this time I've been slowly getting more and more into this project, to the point a few weeks ago I was working on it for 12 or more hours 7 days a week. I went from barely understanding the core concepts to conceptualizing my own new research contributions, while coordinating and organizing the small group efforts for the short and long term while reporting back to my PI.

In terms of actual research our methodology has been to begin from opensource code, implement (what we believe is) SOTA and our own contributions to it and hopefully try to publish in some big DIP/CV Conference/Journal.

My main concern is as the project grows it's gotten to a point I feel it cannot be handled by a group of three people anymore. I sometimes feel overworked since I have to do a manager, communicator, low-level scripting, medium-level data analysis and high-level algorithm implementation programming jobs, while keeping up to date with SOTA literature and coming up/putting in practice my own contributions. Asides from this since I mentioned I don't have lots of CS fundamentals I also need to consume quite a lot of background knowledge I don't have but will probably require somewhere down the road (Data Structures/Algorithms/Operating Systems/Computer Architecture/Information Theory).

I proposed to my PI to recruit more students by communicating we're working on this field, since as I mentioned, no one knows we're working on this since it's pretty far from everything the PI currently does. I have come up my own set ideas to garner interest from potential students (publishing in top conferences being my best bet, but local expositions of our work is another option, among others) and recently he also told me recruited 2 new students which should join our group once the next academic year starts, roughly half a year later, and that I should begin incorporating them into our online discussions and put them up-to-date with our work.

I'm glad because this shifts some of the responsbilities I currently have onto others, but at the same time I feel scared since sometimes I realize there's so many things I don't know about this field and if it crashes and collapses it's all going to be my fault. The other day I found a paper from 2012 which covered something slighly similar to something I had proposed months ago which I thought was novel. There's probably many other examples of how the lit survey I'm doing is lacking and I'm absolutely not qualified for this. I feel bad since I asked for more students and now their research projects/thesis are on my hands and I'm scared I'm going to bring everyone down with me. With this in mind, I would like to know if anyone has any experience on this, organically growing a project and how to distribute work while making sure the ship is in the right track, that can share ANYTHING that would help with this.

I recently graduated with a Master's degree from a two year program in a humanities field.  During the program I had an adviser who had really high expectations for me and had erratic, unpredictable mood swings.  An example of this is when they chewed me out for not fulfilling their expectations the first semester of my first year.  I had begun my graduate degree right after undergraduate without taking a break in between.  When I was struggling with writing a paper for a required course on a subject that I had little experience working with.  They berated me until I cried then comforted me and tried to relate to me.  I left that meeting feeling soooo confused because I couldn't tell if they were on my side or not.  

My relationship with them improved throughout my two years because I gradually figured out what their expectations for me were and I even ended up opening up to them about very personal things and them with me.  However, I could never feel totally secure because they had a tendency to snap on me passive-aggressively, sometimes over little things. (like the way I addressed professors, small grading discrepancies, etc.)  They were also known to do this to other graduate and undergraduate students so I felt comfort in knowing it wasn't just me.  I excused a lot of their behavior because I was their first grad student advisee and I knew they were being tough because they wanted to make me better.

And they did make be a better scholar and student.  During my program they were very willing to advocate for opportunities for me and went above and beyond to provide training for me.  I am truly grateful for everything this adviser did for me, but I also suffered many long nights of crying and mental breakdowns trying to fulfill their expectations.  I started going to counseling (which they knew about) because of they always had really high expectations for me but did not always give me the tools to fulfill them.  This really exacerbated my anxiety and depression.  To this day I'm still dealing with the consequences.

I decided not to tell them all of this before I graduated last year because I wanted to maintain our good relationship, but when I applied to PhD programs this year and asked them for a letter of recommendation, they became extremely controlling and manipulative.  When they saw my list of schools they questioned my readiness to go, even though, they told me I was ready and encouraged me to apply to PhD last year (when I wasn't ready, didn't want to, and didn't have the time for), then they refused to write me letters of rec. unless I applied to the schools they wanted me to, asked me to apply to schools very last minute, and caused me to inconvenience my other recommenders several times.  They also were unemphatic to (or did not realize?) the stress they put me under.  I need the PhD to eventually advance in my desired career.  

My fear is if I don't get into PhD programs this year, that I'll have to ask them more letters of rec. in the future and I'm afraid the same thing will happen all over again.  I'm also afraid to share the good news I have about a new job in my desired career path with them because I don't know if they'll be supportive or be angry because they assume I'm not going to PhD.  Basically, though I'm indebted to them as an advisee and want to have a good relationship with them, I'm afraid of how much power they still hold over me even after I graduated and feel resentful toward them.

Their counselors are of no help, really. I broke down and was pleading for help on the e-counselling section that my uni offers. His replies were SO unhelpful, and I wasn't the only one who thought so. He basically said ""Okay, cool."" in the longest way possible and told me to go get help from a therapist instead. He told me to get medical reports from my doctor and therapist.

I went to therapy and she said that I wasn't going long enough for her to actually write one and needed 3-4 more sessions until she could help. Which is fair. My fourth session is soon and I hope she could write it asap, because my next semester starts in a month. 

I suffer from PCOS which affects me quite a bit, messing with my hormones, making me gain weight, and pushes me further down the depressing pit of.. depression. My gynae said she wasn't going to write me a medical report because it didn't make sense for her to do so and that my hypertension was a more ""severe"" illness. Fine, fair enough.

Having denied one medical report and one more is still processing, sort of, I have serious anxiety issues about asking my GP for one as I literally just newly discovered of my hypertension. I've gone twice or thrice to the GP and they've confirmed me of hypertension but no medications are given. Which stresses me out even more. 

I've spent so much money on this therapist and what if her medical report is just.. not enough? What if my GP won't write me a medical report? 

What would I put in my deferral request letter?

I messed up my whole semester last month because I was so depressed I couldn't for the life of me leave my bed, what more drive an hour to go to class and an hour more back? My groupmates didn't include my name in the final project because some days I couldn't cooperate, but every, single, time I texted them, each and everyone of them would blatantly ignore me. I even straight up asked the group leader if I was still in the group and he didn't even have the decency to tell me no. Ignored, ignored, and ignored. Not soon after that, I was barred for half of my subjects. At that point, I gave up. Every single time I did make it to class, I would cry in the car before going, during breaks, and after. It was so damn traumatizing I couldn't even push through to my final exams of the subjects I wasn't barred for. 

Did I mention I'm under a scholarship from the uni? I am. And if I lose it, I can't afford it. I don't know what to do. 

I want to defer because I need to get my health in check. Both mentally and physically, I am a mess. I love learning. Before this degree, I graduated with a 3.8CGPA for my pre-U. But this uni has broken me with its rude lecturers, and unhelpful peers. One lecturer actually shouted at me that I ""didn't have any problems"" because, quoting her, ""you don't have to go home to kids and you don't have to wash their a\*\*, do you? So what is wrong with you? go see someone because clearly there's something wrong with you. Honestly, just quit architecture"" and another that went ""you'd probably just finish this degree, get married, and never practice it again, so why does it matter that I give you a poor performance report, right?""

Alright, enough of that. Sorry. Those were a few moments etched in my memories that will probably continue to hurt me for life but eh, that's nothing.

I am doing a PhD in country A, and am currently working at my old University in my home country to use equipment.

I have one supervisor and he is bleeding useless. In a way it is good because I can work whereever I want to work but in a way it is bad because when situations like this come along he doesn't help at all and sets me out to do it myself. 

I have aspergers and suffer from depression. So any change that happens really upsets and knocks me down. 

I was notified that I didn't get the main grant for my study country yesterday. I was fine about it (it's very difficult to get) until I realised that my supervisor didn't have a back up plan. 

Essiantally I run out of money in April. Country A is a very expensive country to live in and I will only be able to afford to live in for about 5 months on my savings. 

My supervisor wants me to look out for other grants, but I feel that will take up time from just writing. As after I finish I will have 5 months worth of spending before my savings are used up in country A. However the student halls kick me out in August. 

I've come here cause I realy don't know what to do. My masters supervisor and friend (who I am still in contact with from my original university) has been super supportive. He suggests that I move back to country A and then fly out to country B every now and then to see my main supervisor. My old university is only a train journy away from home and have said that they can offer me a writing desk. 

For my mental health and everything else I have had to deal with my shitty supervisor I think that this might be the best option. But I'm not suppost to come back to the study country before the end of Feburary due to working. And then I have two months to sort everything out. 

I feel like a failure moving back home. But it might be for the best. And even though I have a few friends in country A I do feel happier and more content in my home country. I'm worrying that it will look bad on my part when applying for other jobs ect.

TheFifthHuman,,2018-02-23 05:27:11,7zlpxx,1,"I am a 3rd-year PhD student in Computational Neuroscience. Making art—digital art in particular—is my favorite pastime. Of late, I’ve been thinking of dropping out of PhD and pursuing a career in concept-art: is this a reasonable thing to do, or is it too much of a gamble?

Rather than going on a long ramble about things, I’ll try and list all the conflicting factors at play.

I. RESEARCH 

	⁃ I’m in my late 20’s, and am 2.5 years into my PhD program. Previously I did a Masters in computer science.
	⁃ Largely speaking, I used to like the kind of work that I was doing (which has to deal with developing mathematical models to analyze brain signals). 
	⁃ Of late, I think I’m losing interest: I have trouble focusing on one problem for more than a week; and even when I am working, I feel the urge to take (longish) breaks every hour or so.
	⁃ I have a tendency to get stressed under pressure (e.g. when I’m nearing a deadline). Lately, the stress-levels have increased to the levels that sometimes I cope by completely avoiding the situation (and missing deadlines, losing grades etc.)
	⁃ The general decline of interest has affected my productivity levels: naturally, this has started to affect my relationship with my advisor.

II. MENTAL HEALTH

	⁃ For the past year and a half, I’m under treatment for mild, recurring depression and anxiety-avoidant personality traits. This might be contributing to the troubles mentioned above.
	⁃ I am a little concerned that trying to hang on to the PhD program might further deteriorate my mental health.

III. ART

	⁃ I am fairly good at art but not formally trained in art. Lately, I’ve been trying to self-learn the fundamentals with the help of online-videos and some art textbooks.
	⁃ My interest in art and design dates back to early childhood. In fact, after Bachelors, I seriously considered joining a design-school for Masters: eventually I ended up taking the research/academia route.
	⁃ Sometimes I sketch for hours without a break, which stands in sharp contrast to my terribly short attention span when I’m at work.
	⁃ I’m confident that I can train myself to competent levels in making concept-art and illustrations. However, I have very limited knowledge about the industry at large.
	⁃ For the short-term, I think I’ll be able to find trainee positions, internships and contract work in art and design: however, I don’t know how things will hold up in the longer term.

I’m going to ask my therapist for her suggestion, but I would love to get a general, big-picture perspective as well: which is why this post. All things considered, what do you think would be the best course of action?

I really hope this isn't as off topic as I hope it is and if it is, please delete but I need to figure out if the grad student I am dating is just putting off time with me because he actually is very busy or because hes just not interested anymore. I keep getting mixed signals.

Now, I will preface this by saying were both in STEM life sciences so I know experiments take a long time. I have had 4 years of undergraduate research in various labs so it is not like I don't know how grad students properly do lab work. I've seen it ranging from 1st years to 5th years. He is a 2nd year. I understand undergrad research is obviously way different than research at the graduate level but I also know (just like with studying), when people say they studied 7 hours, what they mean is 7 hours of distracted studying. I will also say that I know for a fact that the notion is if you're staying in lab for so very long every single day, than perhaps you arent using your time the best you can.

He says hes getting more busy and that he has been falling into slight depression where he has become unmotivated and has been pushing off work but that contradicts what I say in the next paragraph.

So sometimes I will ask him if he wants to do anything and he gives me a response that makes me want to believe him, but also not. He will say how he's busy and has been getting busier (but everyone is busy and I kind of dont want to take that as a excuse because even when you are busy, I know you can make time if you really wanted to, but theres also only 24 hours in a day so I get the struggle) but then he will also try to reschedule with me and part of me thinks people generally would make an effort to reschedule if they wanted to spend time with you. So I just told him to not feel obligated if he's busy and focus on what he has to do after he told me he couldn't spend time after the 3rd time. I think I'm going to let him reach out to me and I'll just accept it if it goes on for too long. Maybe I will get the message.

I really am just asking this sub specifically because I want to get a better idea of ""how busy"" a graduate student is, but also get feedback if he's worth keeping around. I know theres many deadlines and progress reports to PI wants, figures made, manuscripts written, assistance in grant writing, what have you, but I can also list the same responsibilities to mostly anyone. I dont see how the business of a PhD student is any different from anyone else. People normally think undergrads just have the most free time in the world when I think it's the exact opposite if you are doing undergrad the ""right"" way. But again, I am only a senior undergrad and would like other people who have been PhD students or professors to enlighten me a little.

FabulousOpposite,t2_26w8g9ss,2019-12-16 19:34:36,ebjwt1,1,"Using my throwaway.

I'm starting the 3rd year of my 2nd PDF in a STEM lab. Throughout grad school and the first PDF, I didn't know what I wanted to do career-wise. About 18 months ago, I had decided to pursue the academic/faculty route, and even interviewed for a position about a year ago. However, the preparation for, and the interview itself destroyed me, and got me doubting very seriously if academia was really for me. From that point onward, I have slowly but surely made the decision that academia is NOT for me (for lots of a reasons, a few of which I'll outline here), and I am formulating a plan to get out as soon as I can.

For one, I've been struggling with my projects, they are pretty challenging and the last few years have been an endless string of failures. While it's not my first rodeo, and I understand that failure is common in science, I'm not happy anymore being in a career where I don't have satisfaction in regular results. I want to help people, I want to be able to complete projects and make a bigger impact. The pursuit of knowledge and the addition of small bits of data to the collective knowledge of humanity is great, and I'm glad there are people passionate about doing that, but it's just not for me anymore. I will be teaching a bit next term (which I am super excited about), and then moving on as soon as I can, probably to pursue some kind of teaching/science education/communication job.

I am also struggling with depression. I am on medication and am seeing a therapist when necessary. I have not shared this information with my PI, because he has previously belittled those with mental illness and has not shown any signs of understanding, courtesy, or sensitivity in this area. He already shows no genuine interest in his trainees are as people, let alone the struggles they are facing that are possibly having an impact on their job performance.

To add to this, my current lab culture is extremely toxic, and my PI is not a good person. He is vindictive, manipulative, passive-aggressive, anti-social, cruel to his students, and has been known to write bad reference letters to unsuspecting HQP. I am pretty scared of him, and how he will treat me once he knows that I want to leave. He has been known to make someone's life difficult once he knows that they are leaving, piling on extra work, asking for unrealistic tasks to be done in a short time, etc.

So this brings us to now. Recently another PDF had a meeting with him, and he complained about every single person to her. About me, he said that ""The project was hard, and now bchmgal doesn't care, but should really be working harder."" He has not said these things to me, nor has he made any effort to ask how I'm doing personally, how I view my career, what I want moving forward, etc. If this is a huge issue for him and if he is critical of my work style and dedication, he has not told me about it personally.

While I am working and showing up every day, I know I could be working harder. I know because in previous years, I would bust my ass and come in evenings and weekends, and push harder to get things completed and try every possible thing because I CARED. Now that I am mentally checked out and am dealing with depression on top of this, I do what I can accomplish realistically in a regular work week, I know I am being paid and have a duty to do my job, but I'm not passionate and there is no extra effort going in on my part. I live for weekends and evenings where I can forget about my job, and live a happier existence.

**So my problem is this**: In the next 6 months, I will be making active steps to leaving this job. My projects will likely all be half finished and nowhere near the manuscript phase, and he will NOT be happy about this. He will try to convince me to stay longer and make my life difficult until the hour that I leave (there is precedent for this in our group). I am afraid that his reference letter, should I ask him to write one, would allude to the incompleteness of projects, my ""need to care and work harder"", and jumping ship on projects, etc. I could easily ask my PhD advisor and past PDF advisor and other colleagues for reference letters (which they have offered to give knowing what is happening in my current job), but I worry that future employers will wonder why I don't have a reference letter from this current PI. He is very well known and his positive reference would go a long way. Aside from this productivity thing, I know I have been an asset to him, he likes my writing and presentation style, I'm dependable, I've brought in my own money on a prestigious fellowship, etc. 

***TLDR:*** I am mentally checked out of my current job, and despite my best efforts, have been having trouble with my projects (ie. low productivity). My PI has been talking about this behind my back, but not to my face, and has been known to write bad reference letters to unsuspecting trainees. **Should I disclose my reasons for being disengaged (mental illness, desire to leave asap, etc) to address his obvious issues with me, or keep them to myself and risk a crappy reference letter?**",AskAcademia,"Planning to leave academia, but afraid of my PI's retaliation.

However, my journey towards actually graduating makes everything that comes after infinitely scarier.

I graduated #4 in my high school and had the opportunity to attend various Top 25 liberal arts programs across the country. However, my (now) alma mater enticed me to attend due to a substantial scholarship. My family is solidly middle class and attending Williams College, for example, would’ve put me into debt in the six figures.

From the moment I got to my college, I hated it. I still performed extremely well academically but my social life was nonexistent. Self-loathing and hopelessness—caused by an inability to feasibly transfer out—gave way to undiagnosed clinical depression. Even as my social life began to demonstrably improve by the end of my sophomore year, the damage had been done. I began to dip academically. I slept for over 15 hours a day and struggled to even look at my assignments. Eventually, my depression became so debilitating that in the Fall Semester of my Junior Year I had to medically withdraw to (1) retain my academic scholarship as it would’ve been rescinded and (2) to resolve my mental health issues.

It was not easy, but I returned to campus over 9 months later with personal, therapeutic, and medicinal resources that I did not have before. I have not been able to in that time return to the student I was in high school. I had to withdraw from a summer course that I was taking prior to returning to school as I was not yet acclimated to academic life just yet. Furthermore, I still struggle with deadlines and regressing to prior mental states when apparent crises arose.

The reason I prefaced the reception of my English degree with the words “hopefully” was because I am awaiting for a grade to be changed from a Not Finished (for all intents and purposes, an F). Over the course of the summer, I had agreed to do an independent study with a professor to write a senior thesis. A week after work began, I developed scarlet fever that incapacitated me for nearly a month. This set back our timeline considerably and meant that the work had to be completed during my final semester.

What ended up happening was I missed the deadline and completely collapsed. I stopped taking my medication and attending classes, as well as started sleeping 16 hours a day once again. Thankfully, my professor reached out to the Dean’s Office and I was compelled to finally speak with him. We agreed to a timetable and discussed exactly what had to occur for me to get the grade I deserve. I completed the work and he’s happy with it, but I now must wait on my college’s Academic Committee to alter the grade. I have explained the circumstances (including an explanation for why I am before them again since the semester before my withdrawal I had to get another Not Finished changed) to the Academic Committee and have the full support of the Dean’s Office and my professor behind me. Even if the Academic Committee is not compassionate, I will only need to complete one more English course for my degree. I will hear back from them in early January.

I just wanted to ask the people on this subreddit with experience in applying to grad schools, am I too far gone? My transcript is a total mess. I did graduate with a 3.6, but it’s not a 3.6 from Harvard. 

To preface this, before even sending out applications, I plan on taking further time on resolving these lingering mental health issues. 

I just can’t see myself doing anything but teaching English in a college/university. I always had plans of going to a prestigious university. I adore books, I love writing, I enjoy research, etc. Most of all, I’d love to be able to be the same light in another student’s life that the above-mentioned professor has been to me.

Like the title says: it's that special time every PhD student watches the more advanced students go through, and now it's my turn. I'm technically in a good place, in a lot of ways. I've done great in grad school, by most measurements (fellowships, grades, etc). I have a postdoc lined up. I have one first-author paper in the books. I've got all the data for a paper that I'm writing up now (to the best of my ability). Then I've only got a couple little things left to do for a third - the paper's already outlined. My advisor is incredibly supportive and kind. Personally, I have a really great partner and 2 dogs who I adore.  


The problem is that I've struggled a lot with mental health and executive function issues. I have ADHD, a long history of trauma/anxiety/depression, largely unsupportive family, and a long and winding non-traditional path through my education. Like, I'm trying to write up this paper and just getting out a few words at a time feels like getting blood from a stone. It's all stuff I know intimately. I keep losing hours of time and not knowing what happened, and feeling like I'm going to break down crying. The deadline for submitting this paper is looming terribly close.  


It's not at all helping that I have never been able to maintain an organized/tidy living space or practice good time management no matter how hard I try (which I only recently discovered was undiagnosed ADHD).  Stress exacerbates this, and then it becomes a feed-forward loop. I set aside time to tidy, but realize 3 hours has gone by and all I've done is put away half a load of clean laundry and I start beating myself up. Then day after day the mess keeps piling up, then when I go to write/work and my table is covered in unopened mail and journal articles and takeout packaging and groceries I never put away, and I can't find any socks and and and... I just start to lose my mind and everything is impossible.   


I keep thinking I need someone to help me somehow. At least to get my apartment to a more livable condition so I can stop having that send me over the edge. I'm seeing a therapist, so that's definitely helpful in keeping me putting one foot after the other every day - but I'm still not making progress at the rate that seems necessary to finish all this. I wish I had like a mom or someone I felt like I could ask to help me go on a weekend cleaning binge. I'm wondering if it's possible to hire someone, but I don't know how to start.

semanticcontempt,t2_56tdmlp1,2020-01-18 00:56:31,eq9hb0,1,"Hi there, sort of a throwaway but actually just my first reddit account. 

tl;dr: A prof took a chance on me and I totally blew it. Do I try to make contact with that prof to make amends and finish my project?

As the title states, as a Sophomore student I was given a (humanities) research study / internship where I would work under my professor doing textual research. The idea was that by the end of the year, I would produce a paper with my professor geared towards publication. This came with a small stipend through a grant. I applied for this grant with a professor I particularly bonded with and was accepted during my freshman year, and the work officially began my sophomore fall semester. 

But that... never really happened. 

Where exactly I screwed up isnt super clear even to me, but basically it comes down to a mix between immaturity, procrastination, unreliability and disorganization. Sophomore year was probably my worst year in terms of depression and anxiety, caused or at least exacerbated by being in a very hectic relationship and frequent drug and alcohol abuse. I've always had a very hard time staying organized, focused, attentive, etc., and if that rings any bells yes I have recently been seeing a therapist for concerns of ADHD/ADD. No diagnosis yet, but my therapist believes I fit all the signs and Im hoping to get tested as soon as I get the funds. 

All this culminated at the time with me really getting nowhere with this project. Meetings with my prof were irregular and infrequent, both because of my fear of showing my lack of work, and also because they are also (seemingly) a very scattered person and would cancel/forget as often as I. I didnt work independently, instead I spent my time (barely) focusing on my classes, playing games, abusing drugs and living as a complete mess. My relationship at the time was taking a turn a loooong for the worse for these same reasons and by the end of junior year was over. 

I never did get out any sort of paper, though I did do enough research to be able to throw together a poster and present it at the undergrad symposium. My professor did not attend. 

There was a research credit attached to this project, and I was given an incomplete in hopes I would be able to finish within several months. But again, that didnt happen. My situation and attitude the next summer and my Junior year was not much better, and I completely avoided so much as running into this prof in the hallways. My shame and fear started to grow into this bolus that rotted in my stomach. The longer I did nothing, the more guilt I felt about it, which made me fearful to even begin, etc. Yeah, I was and still am kind of pathetic. Junior year ended, and the I on my transcript became an F. 

Now I'm finishing my 5th year as an undergraduate, and I'm doing much better for myself. I have a job at a STEM lab on campus, I tutor on the side, I'm doing a lot better in my classes. More importantly, I feel much more stable in my living situation, hobbies/habits, mental state and overall life. Im working hard, avoiding bad habits, and feeling comfortable in my own skin for the first time in my life. 

So, with 1 semester left to graduate (though ill be going to grad school at my same institution in the fall), do I try to right my wrong? I obviously really disappointed a prof who was willing to take a chance on me and honestly I really adored. I really disappointed myself, of course. And the subject matter does indeed interest me! I feel much more able to take on this project, both in terms of my scope of knowledge and life habits. There is also a course on this very topic the prof is teaching currently, and so I do have a less righteous reason of wanting to take their class again aswell. 

What say you reddit? Should I come with some work already done to show I won't fail a second time? Do I simply talk to them first, before anything else? And if so, how do I make my apology? Would I be doing this for the right reasons, or am I just opening up old wounds in an attempt to make myself feel less guilty about the past?

I made a post two weeks ago about a depressive episode that made it very hard to complete a lab report. I ended up getting a 97, that was a 67 with the 3 day late penalty. 

Right now, I'm in a similar position for lab 2. It will be 3 days late before I submit it and I will likely do well. 

I have only ever turned in 2 assignments late in during my entire 3.5 semesters of college, 1 of those being the past lab report. This upcoming one will make it 3. 

I am not exaggerating when I say that this lab report has caused me panic attacks and made me sleep like 10 hours each of the past few nights (thinking I could sleep away my problems). This misery has even prevented me from doing 1 other assignment (making my total late assignments 4), because I hate being awake with it hanging over my head. 

Again, there's some level of personal accountability involved, but this, (as displayed my aforementionedacademic history) is entirely uncharacteristic. These lab reports make me legitimately miserable, causing me to sleep ungodly amounts.

Academic situation:

* I'm **about to graduate my masters** (in Europe), I have to pass just two more courses, a semester thesis and then a master thesis. (So I would finish next year.)
* The courses aren't directly related to what I'm interested in, because it's too specific and I've had all the introductionary courses already.
* I **did 2 research projects** with different people and I think the work was solid (although not ""perfect"" either, like one thing didn't work out as hoped) but I'm not really networking, don't know how it works and terrible social skills, actually I wouldn't be surprised if they think I'm weird or think badly of me for never contacting them afterwards.
* I **finally know two fields that really interest me** both in the big field of artifical intelligence (RL and SNN), but I performed badly during exams related to these fields and cannot make up for it...
* Also completely failed a couple courses not related directly to my interest, my master's **transcript is terrible**. My bachelor transcript was a lot better.

Personal situation:

* I've exploited most of my university's counseling, and it was mostly bad. The therapist they ended up suggesting to me 3 years ago really wasn't able to help me like I kept getting worse and I wasted a lot of time because I was too low to switch (and the bureaucracy of switching therapists), until I finally did last year. Still, it really was mainly my mental health that made my grades so bad.
* I'm doing a bit better now with different professionals and getting tested for ADHD soon. If it turns out positive, at least I know why everything academic related is a mess and hopefully will find a solution to it (otherwise it will probably be antidepressants again, though I don't have the full blown depression right now).
* But I'm still impaired to the point where **I can function like 20-40%** of what healthy people would and my working memory is really bad. I usually compensate by pouring all my energy into studying, and this leads to burn out eventually. 
* Also my social life is almost non existent. I live with my family because it's an expensive city, and we don't have a campus culture like in the US. 

Questions:

1. Is it realistic to even think about a PhD at this point? I don't really strive for an academic career, but I would like to conduct research. (Also the PhD itself would be interesting.)
2. If I don't get a PhD, is it realistic to do some kind of research in a company with a bad master degree? I don't find many positions advertised in these fields, like I guess they do their own hiring, and if a position is advertised it very rarely aligns with what I'm interested in, in the best case they want someone to throw deep learning at a problem, but I'm more interested in like novel concepts.

I show up for my teaching duties, but that's about it: I've gone several months without checking email, have let basic administrative things go, am not doing well in other parts of my life, sleep a lot, and needless to say have made essentially no progress on my dissertation.

I am trying to confront this with the help of a therapist and, hopefully, soon a psychiatrist. I am also lucky in that my school really, really wants to support me. At several points in the past few months, my advisors have asked how they can support me. We've tried creating regular check-in systems a couple times, but both times I abandoned those after one or two successful check-ins. I'm hoping that now that I'm being more honest with myself and those around me,  and getting more focused mental health care, this time will be different.

But the truth is that whenever they've asked how they can help (which I suspect they will again at our next meeting), I have felt lost, because the enormity of everything seems so overwhelming compared to what I seem to be capable of doing. Perhaps the answer is simply to focus on letting the mental health professionals help, so that hopefully eventually I'll be able to do the work I'm supposed to do for my PhD. As a TA, I'm certainly aware of the fact that a teacher can only do so much for their students, both due to time/resource limitations and lack of mental health training.

Nevertheless, in case there is something helpful I'm missing, I'd love to know if people who have been in similar situations have found anything particularly helpful (or unhelpful...) in terms of what their advisors could do to support them. I do genuinely believe both of my advisors want to help in any way feasible, and the part of me that is holding out hope for getting through this PhD wants to help make that happen as much as I can.

Now I'm leaning towards leaving academia, but I am not sure what jobs to apply for.

During my PhD my life situation was quite different. With no kids I could - and did - dedicate myself wholly to the work. I frequently worked from morning till night seven days a week - and I loved it. I was productive and successful with fairly free reins.

Now I have two kids. I cannot work much beyond 9-5, and my spouse has secured a great job, a fantastic start to a promising career. I am very pleased with that, but it prevents international travel for me. As for my post doc my PI could hardly care less. They are never around (I see them max ten-fifteen minutes every two months or so - no exaggeration) and I'm practically abandoned with no group surrounding me, no collaborators and no project. I'm making do by initiating my own projects, writing proposals and so on - but being alone with no group is something I find more stressful than I thought I would.

I have been struggling with this feeling for quite a long time and I can't seem to shrug it of, so I was wondering if you guys could help with the following situation. I tried looking for threads about people being in a similar place, but they are almost always in graduate school so sorry for this post but I couldn't find anything similar for undergrads in a similar place.

I started some 4/5 years ago at a vocational school, in which I found my passion in computer science. Soon I realized that I really wanted to deal with computer science research. Afterwards I spended all my time getting into a good research university so I could do my undergrad there. Currently I'm 22 with a decent amount of debt looking to finish undergrad in 3 or 4 years time although it is highly usual to also do a masters afterwards in my country.  

Getting to this point was really stressful, I worked myself way too hard and gave up a decent career but finally made it. After getting in I completely crashed and due to combination of personal circumstances and sacrifices I had to make and I nearly committed suicide out of depression. I got out of my depression due my personal circumstances improving, but noticed that I have a hard time keeping up with all of the course work for longer periods.  

This has gotten so bad that I sometimes start crying after a little bit of work and being incapable of doing anything else for that entire day. Making me only feel even more stressed.

I love my field and love doing research. It is something that I always work a little bit on during longer breaks of school and my professors did say to me it was interesting (although they had no time to help me working it out further). 

Hence here I am in tears full of self doubt and stress. Wondering if I should take leave early from this path and leaving me be forever be disappointing in myself, or continuing killing myself with stress until I get expelled this year because of not getting the required amount of credit (I already got an extension on this last year due to my circumstances, but I don't believe they are allowed to make another).",AskAcademia,At what point is it worth giving up for your mental health?

In a personal aspect, just the fact that I’d have a graduate degree would be a major accomplishment for me. Starting in 2006 until 2009 I was in a severely abusive relationship, escaping only by running away one night while my boyfriend went to the gas station. Then just months after escaping I got very unexpectedly pregnant by a guy I had just started dating.

Said “good guy” walked out on me without warning or reason one random day two months before our wedding. I moved back in with my parents and I promised myself and my son that we would never depend on another man ever again. I enrolled in school, started in June of this year and graduate with my Bachelor’s degree in March. I didn’t think I’d come this far, but here I am. And getting a graduate degree would be like accomplishing something I haven’t thought possible for myself since I was an ambitious teenager. In the personal sense, $12,600 of debt for a graduate degree is worth every. single. cent. 

But I have to be rational, and if career wise getting an MBA will not open up opportunities for me that I wouldn’t otherwise have, then I can’t justify pursuing one. So is getting an MBA truly worth it? I make chump change at my current job...$14/hr with no benefits. Just having my Bachelor’s degree should increase my annual earnings by at least $10,000. How much more could I expect to make with an MBA? I definitely appreciate any and all feedback.

I'm really not sure what to ask because while I have so many questions in my head, I also feel like I don't know where to start.

Maybe this: any of you has any specific tips for publishing in reputable journals? I tried the tips of inviting an expert to read my paper and invite him or her as a co-author too, but that only goes so far. Any specific strategies that you guys do that have actually helped you publish?

TechnicalPurpose,,2018-02-07 01:55:40,7vsn2x,1,"This is a giant wall of text and I'm so sorry I've rambled so much.

The tl;dr is essentially that I'm an undergrad student and my brain isn't working, possibly due to bad medication choices, and I haven't done much of anything all semester. I'm going to see my doctor next week and an academic adviser ASAP to figure out what's going on and what to do to fix this, but any advice anyone can offer on what I should be doing in the mean time would be so helpful.

I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid, ASD two years ago, and have had pretty bad depression/suicidal tendencies since I was 7. Last year I was experiencing a pretty awful case of burn out that greatly exasperated my mental health issues. I had to withdraw from my classes after a suicide attempt and spent a five months focused on therapy and improving my mental health before going back to school for a few classes in the summer, then back to full time last semester. 

I started taking ADHD medication just after I was diagnosed with ASD and an antidepressant last year just after I left school. I developed some pretty bad anxiety issues in the last two years (I assume this a side effect of the ADHD medication now, but I didn't line up the timing until now) that progressively got worse and led to me having panic attacks a few times a week last semester. They were really negatively impacting my life, so I switched anti-depressants in December after classes ended to something more suitable for anxiety. 

I was home with no work or classes for 3 weeks and figured that would be a good time to help me get in the rhythm of the new medication. My anxiety issues disappeared, which seemed great at first, but over the last week I've realized that I'm much worse off now because I've become incredibly apathetic, distracted, have horrible migraines, and I'm physically and mentally exhausted all the time. I don't know how to describe it, but my brain/mind feels weird. I can't focus my attention enough to do anything productive for more then a few minutes at a time, can barely get myself out of bed to go to class, and haven't been able to focus my attention enough to do much of any school work. I have a bunch of over due assignments that will only take a few hours to do that I've told myself everyday for the last two weeks I'm going to do when I wake up, but I just can't get any motivation to actually do them and procrastinate all day until it's suddenly 3 am.

I'm being an absolutely terrible student, and I know that. I 
 can look at the situation rationally and realize I have to do these things or I'll destroy my future, but I just don't care. It's not even that these assignments are boring and I won't enjoy doing them, they're all things I used to be excited about. I don't understand what's going on with me. This is entirely unlike me, though. I was a great student, on the Deans list every semester except the last one, had great relationships with my professors, have multiple student awards listed on my transcript, was in a few student clubs, and did 10-20 hours of volunteer work before the suicide attempt. I know I was over doing it before, hence the burn out, but now I just sit around, binge netflix all day, browse reddit, and doodle. 

The antidepressant I'm on is known to induce apathy, and I had a similar occurrence with another antidepressant in the same class when I was in high school. My ADHD medication are know to lead to dependency and cause fatigue/confusion like I'm experiencing now if you build up your tolerance, but the anxiety I experience with them greatly out weighs any positive benefits they offer, so I would rather go off them then up the dosage. I might need to detox from the medications I'm on or switch to something else, but with either scenario, I'm likely going to be tired/loopy/ill while detoxing or adapting to new medications. 

Obviously, the first step is to see a doctor to discuss the issues. The soonest I can get in to see my psychiatrist is next week, which really sucks since midterms are next week and I'm probably going to bomb them, but I guess it's a start. I assume I should make an appointment with an academic adviser, which I'll do tomorrow morning when the offices are open, but in the mean time, what else should I be doing? 

Also, I was planning on applying to grad school in two years, but now I think the withdrawals/crap marks last semester/current screw up has entirely destroyed any chances of me getting in. I still have above the GPA requirements and got a pretty high score on the GRE this summer. If I get my mental health in check and turn this around over the next year or two, will schools generally look past this kind of thing?

fleemfleemfleemfleem,t2_485hniyq,2020-01-12 04:18:00,enireh,1,"What would you include in an FAQ? 

I made a list of some questions I seen asked and answered pretty often on this sub. What would you add, or change?

**FAQ**

*Publishing*

    • Can I publish without an academic affiliation
        ◦ This is a qualified yes. It’s much more difficult to publish without an institutional affiliation, especially if you are a true outsider to academia. For one thing, journals often have fees in the hundreds or thousands of dollars to publish. Another aspect to consider is that academic publishing has incredibly high standards. It’s difficult to learn and understand these expectations and standards if you  haven’t been trained in academia. It’s a part of the “soft curriculum” that you learn in graduate school. 
    • How do I access articles outside of a university?
        ◦ Publishing companies make money both by charging fees to download articles, charging university libraries for subscriptions, and by charging academics to publish. You can request a “reprint” for free from one of the authors of the article, and they will generally send you a copy for free. There is also a legally grey area of using scihub to access articles. 
    • Why does this publisher want things in such an archaic format?
        ◦ They were sold software 15 years ago, and never bothered to upgrade. They also don’t often submit to their own journal so they aren’t aware of how odd it would be to include a fax number, or send typewritten pages. 
    • How often should I be publishing at (career stage)?
        ◦ This is entirely dependent on your sub-field. Look at people who have the job you want and see how often the were publishing when at your stage.
    • How do you track citations when writing an academic article?
        ◦ There are a number of software packages designed for this ranging from free to quite expensive, and which you use depends on where you find your articles, and what software you use for word processessing, as well as what your collaborators and co-authors have standardized on. Endnote is often available as an institutional subscription. Many use free options such as zotero or mendelay. If you like to write in google docs, Paperpile is a good option. Options are different still, if you use LaTeX. 
    • How important is impact factor, or other metrics to selecting a journal?
        ◦ It depends on your field and career stage. IF matters more prior to tenure, or job search. 
    •  How do I select a journal to publish in? 
        ◦ Experience. What journals published the papers you cited in the article?
    • How important is publishing as a PhD student?
        ◦ Generally speaking, very. Some fields have different requirements, though. Some might expect that PhD research would generate a book at an academic press. Others might expect 1-6 papers in decent peer reviewed journals in your field. You find out by asking your adviser for their expectations. 
    • I changed my name when I got married/transitioned. Should I continue to publish under my old name, or start publishing under my new name?
        ◦ Unfortunately the academic publishing system was largely designed in a period when most academics were men who did not change their names at marriage. This can make it difficult to track an academic’s publications when they change their last name. Some change names, and simply list all their publications on their google scholar, CV, or other publication list. Others continue to use their pre-marriage or pre-transition name on publicaitons. This is a personal choice.
    • My adviser published my work after I left the group, and (included my name without permission/did not include my name). What is my recourse?
        ◦ Start by contacting your former adviser. You can escalate to an ombudsperson or an editor at the journal. 

*Conferences*

    • How much of my conference time should be spent working? 
        ◦ At least most of it. Make sure to attend at least some events each day. You can go to dinner at night, or take a day to explore the city you’re visiting, but you’re mostly there to work. 
    • Do conferences go on your CV?
        ◦ This is field dependent. In some fields such as computer science conference publications are a more important unit of academic productivity than they are in others. Look at the CV of someone else in your field, and see how they organize them. 
    • I have never been to a conference before, what should I expect? 
        ◦ Travel early so that you have time to get relax before the conference itself. Conferences are overwhelming. Get to your hotel, change into clean clothes, watch some TV, then head over to registration. 
        ◦ Don’t feel you have to go to every session. 
        ◦ Asking questions at talks is an important way to become recognizable to more established researchers in your field. Likewise going to poster sessions and meeting and talking to lots of people is a great way to make connections and get to know younger people in your field. 
        ◦ If you get the chance make some conference friends. It’s very rewarding to have people that you look forward to seeing every year. 
    • I’m nervous about speaking, how do I prepare?
        ◦ Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse. Rope people into a practice talk. Make sure that your have the introduction and conclusion down pat. Make sure that every slide is simplified to: an image, and maybe one or two explanatory lines. No one wants to read giant text blocks. Have one big idea per slide.
    • How do I “network” at a conference?
        ◦ The word networking is intimidating, but really its just talking to people. Ask questions after talks, approach people at posters and ask questions or compliment them. Go to the dinners and sit next to strangers. Bring business cards to hand out with your name and academic affiliation.

*Dissertations*

    • Is it normal to feel ‘empty’ after defending my dissertation?
        ◦ Yes, this is very common. The phenomenon goes by several names. Post achievement depression, success hangover, or the arrival fallacy. The arrival fallacy is the fallacious belief that you will achieve happiness when some goal is reached. As you approach that goal, you have already included those accomplishments in your perception of the world, so the new achievement just seems status quo. Learn to celebrate your accomplishments, regardless of that feeling.
    • How do I select a dissertation topic? 
        ◦ You should be having regular meetings with your adviser and committee, and they should be helping you develop your research. If your project has already gone through peer review several time by the time you defend, it will be difficult for your committee to turn it down. 
    • What happens if I fail?
        ◦ You need to listen to your adviser and committee. They won’t propose that you defend until they know you’ll pass. A failing student is an embarrassment, that they don’t want. For the most part the only students who fail are the ones who ignore the advise of their committee and defend too early. 

*Relationships*

    • Should I date (a faculty member/a student)?
        ◦ No. Generally speaking this kind of relationship is a bad idea. There are inherent power imbalances in a relationship between people who work together, but have different ranks. It’s especially bad if one advises the other, or teaches them in a class. Look up the faculty handbook for your university for the specific rules regarding faculty/student relationships. Some forbid it expressly, some discourage it, some forbid it if one is in a direct position of power over the other. 
        ◦ Others will advise you to follow your heart when you find the opportunity. Each situation is unique, and the best you can do use to use whatever your best judgment is, being fully aware of the potential consequences. 
    • When is the right time to have kids?
        ◦ There is no ‘good time.’ Do it when it feels right for you and your partner, and make your academic life work around it. Life is happening now, not at some indeterminable point in the future. 
    • Should I ask out my labmate/coworker
        ◦ Always ask yourself: “If this goes south and I still have to work with this person after the breakup, how will we both feel?” Also “If he or she rejects me, will I be too embarrassed to work with them in the future. 

*Plagiarism*

    • My (paper/dissertation) was plagiarized, what do I do?
        ◦ Contact the journal editor and report the plagiarism. If you need to escalate go to an ombudsperson at their university or their chair. 
    • I was caught plagiarizing, what do I do?
        ◦ Show genuine contrition, and convince the people punishing you that you’ve learned why what you did was wrong, and will never do it again.
    • My student plagiarized, what do I do?
        ◦ Look up your university policy on academic dishonesty. See what you wrote in your syllabus. Before you act, make sure you have evidence that proves the cheating. Administration won’t always take your side, so make sure you have all your ducks in a row before punishing a student for academic dishonesty. 

*Sexual Harassment*

    • I am being sexually harassed by another student, a colleague, my adviser, or someone else. 
        ◦ First make sure that you are safe. 
        ◦ In the US you should go to your university’s title IX officer, and report the harassment. They will help you with next steps and who to contact. 
    • My adviser acts weird around me, but it hasn’t risen to the level of sexual harassment, what can I do? 
        ◦ Communicate to them what’s making you uncomfortable. Barring that, have a discussion with a neutral party in the university. 
    • I was at a conference/after work party and people were acting weird. What can I do?
        ◦ 
*Correspondence*

    • How do I write to a professor? Will it annoy them?
        ◦ Use a formal letter format with their title, and a salutation at the end. Use good grammar, and address them by their earned academic title or position. If they hold a PhD, do not refer to them as Mr. Ms. Or Mrs. If you are unsure, “professor” is fine, even if they are an adjunct.
    • This person isn’t answering my emails in a timely manner, how often can I follow up?
        ◦ Some people are just really, really bad at email. Worst case scenario you may have to stop by their office during office hours. Don’t go to their house or call their home phone.
    • Is it okay to write to this person and ask them for x?
        ◦ Generally speaking, it can’t hurt to ask. The worst someone can say is no. 

*Job Search/Applications*

    • The referent for my applications hasn’t submitted their letter of recommendation and there are only a few days remaining, what do I do?
        ◦ It’s not uncommon for referents to wait until the last minute to submit a letter. It is reasonable to send a reminder a few days before the letters are due. Committees usually recognize that letters are out of your hands, so they should be okay with someone who gets the letter in late. 
    • Should I ask (x) person for a letter?
        ◦ Make sure it’s someone who knows you well, and will remember you. Someone you saw often in office hours or worked with on a project. If they say “I don’t know that I can write you a great letter.” That’s a sign to look for someone else. 
        ◦ It helps when asking for a letter to pre-write a draft letter about yourself for them to modify and then submit. This seems weird, but it makes it 1000x easier for the person writing the letter.
    • A student asked me for a letter, but I don’t remember them, or can’t give them a good recommendation, what do I do?
        ◦ Gently suggest that they would be better off going to someone else for a letter.
        ◦ If they don’t get the message, tell them in clear terms that you won’t write them a good letter.
        ◦ Don’t write a negative letter. This can result legal liability, and it isn’t fair to the student. Don’t even do the “damning faint praise” thing. Send them to someone who can recommend them. 
    • How many jobs should I be applying to?
        ◦ Many academic jobs get 100-200 applications for a single spot. You may need to put in this many applications to get a single spot. The most openings are usually in the late summer or fall. Start more than a year before you’ll be on the market and create your basic application. Apply to everything that even remotely fits your needs. The process can be dehumanizing, and not every committee will write back with a no. 
        ◦ Create a spreadsheet to keep track of jobs you’re interested in, which you’ve applied to, what the deadlines are, and if you’ve received invitations to phone interview, in person interview, or received an offer. 
    • What should I expect on a phone interview?
        ◦ You’ll be on a conference call with the committee. They’ll ask you at least:
            ▪ Why our school?
            ▪ When would you be able to start?
            ▪ Would you be happy in (location)?
        ◦ They may ask
            ▪ About your teaching philosophy
            ▪ A lay rundown of your research
            ▪ Your grant plan over the next three years
            ▪ Ballpark startup needs
            ▪ Who in the department you might see being able to collaborate with. 
        ◦ You should prepare for the phone interview by writing out answers to those questions, and printing out and having in front of you:
            ▪ Profiles of anyone you know is on the hiring committee
            ▪ The mission statement of the university
            ▪ Questions for the committee
        ◦ Safe questions for the committee give them a chance to brag and don’t embarrass them
            ▪ Ask about the department environment
            ▪ Ask what distinguishes their students
            ▪ Ask what they think you should know that you haven’t asked
            ▪ Ask about the promotion and tenure processes
    • What should I expect from an in person interview
        ◦ At least a day of rapid fire 30-minute interviews with everyone in the department
        ◦ At least one dinner with the entire committee, or chair
        ◦ A talk which may be research, a teaching demonstration, or a combination of these
        ◦ A formal meeting and interview with the hiring committee. 
        ◦ A possible meeting with the dean
        ◦ Keep in mind that you are being interviewed from the second you get off of the airplane. You need to be “on” the entire time, and don’t let your guard down to drink too much at dinner. 
    • How many graduate programs should I apply to 
        ◦ Usually 9-12 is a good number, depending on your field, background, and what you can afford. 
    • How do I choose an adviser?
        ◦ One important thing that’s often overlooked is talking to other students. Ask what they’re like to work with. Ask if they’re a creep. Ask how long other students have taken to graduate. Make sure they don’t have anger issues. Ask if you can see what some of their previous advisees have gone on to do.",AskAcademia,What questions and answers would you include in an FAQ?

-   My adviser acts weird around me, but it hasn’t risen to the level of sexual harassment, what can I do?

    -   Communicate to them what’s making you uncomfortable. Barring that, have a discussion with a neutral party in the university.
-   I was at a conference/after work party and people were acting weird. What can I do?

    -	Communicate what made you uncomfortable.

**Correspondence**

-   How do I write to a professor? Will it annoy them?

    -   Use a formal letter format with their title, and a salutation at the end. Use good grammar, and address them by their earned academic title or position. If they hold a PhD, do not refer to them as Mr. Ms. Or Mrs. If you are unsure, “professor” is fine, even if they are an adjunct.
        Dear Dr. X:
        Sincerely, Y
-   This person isn’t answering my emails in a timely manner, how often can I follow up?

    -   Some people are just really, really bad at email. Worst case scenario you may have to stop by their office during office hours. Don’t go to their house or call their home phone.
-   Is it okay to write to this person and ask them for x?

    -   Generally speaking, it can’t hurt to ask. The worst someone can say is no.

**Job Search/Applications**

-   The referent for my applications hasn’t submitted their letter of recommendation and there are only a few days remaining, what do I do?

    -   It’s not uncommon for referents to wait until the last minute to submit a letter. It is reasonable to send a reminder a few days before the letters are due. Committees usually recognize that letters are out of your hands, so they should be okay with someone who gets the letter in late.
-   Should I ask (x) person for a letter?

    -   Make sure it’s someone who knows you well, and will remember you. Someone you saw often in office hours or worked with on a project. If they say “I don’t know that I can write you a great letter.” That’s a sign to look for someone else.
    -   It helps when asking for a letter to pre-write a draft letter about yourself for them to modify and then submit. This seems weird, but it makes it 1000x easier for the person writing the letter.
-   A student asked me for a letter, but I don’t remember them, or can’t give them a good recommendation, what do I do?

    -   Gently suggest that they would be better off going to someone else for a letter.
    -   If they don’t get the message, tell them in clear terms that you won’t write them a good letter.
    -   Don’t write a negative letter. This can result legal liability, and it isn’t fair to the student. Don’t even do the “damning faint praise” thing. Send them to someone who can recommend them.
-   How many jobs should I be applying to?

    -   Many academic jobs get 100-200 applications for a single spot. You may need to put in this many applications to get a single spot. The most openings are usually in the late summer or fall. Start more than a year before you’ll be on the market and create your basic application. Apply to *everything* that even remotely fits your needs. The process can be dehumanizing, and not every committee will write back with a no.
    -   Create a spreadsheet to keep track of jobs you’re interested in, which you’ve applied to, what the deadlines are, and if you’ve received invitations to phone interview, in person interview, or received an offer.
-   What should I expect on a phone interview?

    -   You’ll be on a conference call with the committee. They’ll ask you at least:

        -   Why our school?
        -   When would you be able to start?
        -   Would you be happy in (location)?
    -   They may ask

        -   About your teaching philosophy
        -   A lay rundown of your research
        -   Your grant plan over the next three years
        -   Ballpark startup needs
        -   Who in the department you might see being able to collaborate with.
    -   You should prepare for the phone interview by writing out answers to those questions, and printing out and having in front of you:

        -   Profiles of anyone you know is on the hiring committee
        -   The mission statement of the university
        -   Questions for the committee
    -   Safe questions for the committee give them a chance to brag and don’t embarrass them

        -   Ask about the department environment
        -   Ask what distinguishes their students
        -   Ask what they think you should know that you haven’t asked
        -   Ask about the promotion and tenure processes

-   What should I expect from an in person interview

    -   At least a day of rapid fire 30-minute interviews with everyone in the department
    -   At least one dinner with the entire committee, or chair
    -   A talk which may be research, a teaching demonstration, or a combination of these
    -   A formal meeting and interview with the hiring committee.
    -   A possible meeting with the dean
    -   Keep in mind that you are being interviewed from the second you get off of the airplane. You need to be “on” the entire time, and don’t let your guard down to drink too much at dinner.
-   How many graduate programs should I apply to

    -   Usually 9-12 is a good number, depending on your field, background, and what you can afford.
-   How do I choose an adviser?

    -   One important thing that’s often overlooked is talking to other students. Ask what they’re like to work with. Ask if they’re a creep. Ask how long other students have taken to graduate. Make sure they don’t have anger issues. Ask if you can see what some of their previous advisees have gone on to do.",AskAcademia,What questions and answers would you include in an FAQ?

Last year I made a medical request for a single room because having a roommate was throwing me into a very severe depression, causing spikes in my anxiety, and making my OCD much worse. Unfortunately, my request was denied, and this semester everything has gone to hell in terms of my mental health - doctors keep putting me on more and more medications in order to deal with my depression, anxiety, and OCD, and I don't want to keep taking meds if all I need is a room to myself. I've considered reapplying for a single room, but it seems hopeless - my psychiatrist wrote a very strong letter saying that a room to myself is very important to my mental health, filled out tons of forms detailing all the medication I've been prescribed after getting a roommate, and the housing department still decided that it's not necessary, so I don't think anything will change. 

In order to resolve this problem, I was planning on transferring to a school in Europe, where not only would I be able to finally study in another language, which I think would be a fun challenge, but I could get my own apartment and hopefully find myself in a better mental state.

I **started studying for the GRE at the beginning of Summer**, knowing that I'd have to put significant time into studying for the quantitative section since I've never been really confident in math. Plus, I never took geometry (kind of fucked off in high school), let alone trig or calc. All I needed was stats to transfer, and I got As in both of the stats classes that I've had to take.

Part of the application process requires an essay. I don't have much experience writing these kinds of essays, so I would appreciate any feedback anyone has for me.



This is the prompt: 



 ""Please tell us the relevant courses you have taken, the type of course work you plan to take to prepare yourself for a career in research, and why research in the biomedical sciences is important to you. Your career goals should also be clear as well as your reasons for wanting to join this program abs what you believe you night contribute to the goals of it.""

The maximum number of words is 1000, which is exactly how long my essay is.



Here is my essay:



When I enrolled as a community college student, I told myself I would only transfer to a university if I fell in love with a career path that required a university education. As a student without financial support from my family, I knew that I would have to work to put myself through college, and that I would rely on the generosity of government grants, scholarships, and student loans to finance my education. I knew from the start that it would be a waste of all financial assistance I received, as well as my own time, if I did not have a good reason for attending university.  



I concluded a desire to spend my time in something I truly enjoy, for I do not see lasting fulfillment coming from working for the sole reward of money. I asked myself, if I didn't have to ""make a living,"" what would I do each day? My answer was immediate: I would learn everything I could about the subjects that interest me and share my findings with others. I realized I want to be a college professor. But what would I study? I was interested in psychology at the time, but as I continued to study the discipline, I became absorbed by the brain itself. During my time at XXXX, I have continued to narrow my interest to neuroscience of medical issues. By studying the brain, I can play a meaningful role in society by helping people who suffer where science's understanding rests incomplete.  After considerable research and discussion with my mentors, I changed my major to biology. I believed this would best prepare me to enter a neuroscience PhD program directly after my undergraduate degree. I determined that a strong foundation in the sciences that elucidate neuroscience, such as biology, chemistry, and physics, is paramount.  



At the core of my decision to major in biology is the perspective that my coursework is a purposeful training for my future as a researcher, which will enable me to someday make significant contributions to my field. Much of my coursework has already done this. Biology of the Cell and Fundamentals of General Chemistry provided the foundation for my further education in both of these core disciplines. In General Psychology, I began to see the brain as the source from which our experience as human beings arises. In Biological Psychology, I was introduced to some of the underlying biological mechanisms of the brain. This class inspired me, sparking my curiosity in the brain. In Experimental Psychology, I was introduced to the world of experiment and research. College Statistics provided an essential foundation in statistical analysis, an essential tool for any researcher.  Similarly, I my enjoyment and success in English Composition classes will help me as a researcher. After all, it is through writing -- and ultimately publication -- that professors reach the widest audience.  



My future coursework will continue to prepare me for research. Biology courses, including Neurobiology, Biology of Organisms, Biology of Populations, Cell Physiology, Molecular Biology, and Genetics, will provide the information necessary for understanding the brain in the context of the biological organism it drives. Further, I believe I require a strong understanding of chemistry, as biology is the sum of chemical interactions. Therefore I will take a year of General Chemistry and Organic Chemistry, as well as a course in Biochemistry. This same logic gives rise to my interest in physics coursework. The laws of physics lead to those of chemistry and biology, and thus a year of Physics will prove important.



The other component of my training as a future scientist is research. Thus far, I have participated in a summer research program at XXXXX, during which I worked full-time in XXXX's lab, studying the neurobiology of mice selectively bred for voluntary high wheel-running. I developed a project under the supervision of a graduate student who was underway sectioning and analyzing brain regions. I became curious about the mechanisms that contribute to the mice's ability to run three-fold more than control mice. I examined the periaqueductal gray, a midbrain landscape implicated in the mediation of both ascending and descending nociceptive pathways. Given the relationship between exercise and pain, I wondered if the mice had structural differences in brain regions involved in pain. Previous research showed the mice possessed larger midbrains, so I determined this area warranted closer inspection. My project required employing a Nissl-staining protocol to identify the nuclei of the tissue. Using microscopy, I captured photographs of the sections. With the guide of a brain atlas, I delineated the periaqueductal gray using software. We then analyzed for differences in neuronal density and area. I wrote a paper on the project, as well as presented a poster at XXXX's student symposium. Over winter break, I have continued to volunteer in this lab.



If accepted to XXXX, I would like to work with one of the following professors: Dr. X, who studies synapses and neurotransmitters; Dr. X, who investigates the neurobiology of depression; or Dr. C, who examines the effects of drugs on the brain. Of course, given the integrative nature of neuroscience, the opportunity to work in any relevant lab would prove useful to a developing neuroscientist.



I feel that XXXXX would provide an invaluable opportunity to me as an aspiring college professor and researcher. I recently resigned from my part-time job, so that I can continue to be involved in research during my time as an undergraduate. If I am accepted, the opportunity would provide me the financial means to continue working on research, along with other resources, such as faculty mentoring, which I will need to be successful in my goal of acceptance into a neuroscience PhD program directly after my bachelor's degree.



I realize there are many applicants to this program, but in your decision, I hope you will consider me. This opportunity will help me accomplish what I want to do with my life.    



Sincerely,

I am currently a high schooler that's deeply interested in learning physics and engineering - really, what holds our cosmos together, and what we've created from it. Due to my school's structuring and scheduling, it will most likely not be possible for me to take any advanced physics classes at this point, with everything else I'll be taking, and even more impossible for me to learn coding or engineering in depth. (Due to wasting months of opportunities with my depression, constantly being out of school and in therapy, I had to drop down to simpler classes to accommodate my life - which now requires me to make up some of the parts that I missed in courses next year, if I wish to continue math and science - which I do). 

With little knowledge in physics or engineering, though a burning desire to understand how computers work, and what quantum mechanics is, I would like to figure out how to learn both these subjects as if I was taking them as courses in school, though by using online resources to do so. 

The problem is, many resources I find online assume the student to have a large background knowledge in mathematics and basic physics, both which I do not have (being a high schooler and all). I want to learn everything I could have learned in my advanced classes if I hadn't lost my place, and more, if possible.

Do you have suggestions about what I might be able to do fill in my knowledge and start learning from the basics, so I'm not completely confused when I start learning it?

I have a book in my possession by Isaac Asimov, ""Understanding Physics"", and I found ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"" free online (sponsored by CalTech). I haven't started them yet, though.

Background:

I graduated from the University of Central Florida in May 2013 after completing degrees in Biotechnology and Bio-medical Sciences. My undergraduate career was a somewhat misguided affair, influenced both by my inability to choose an academic path ( I simply didn't know what I wanted to do) and my mother's somewhat pervasive idea that she'd delight in my becoming a doctor. So that's what I tried for. As much as I tried convincing myself I'd become a doctor, I didn't truly believe it, and I didn't truly want it. And so, given that the means didn't justify the ends...I struggled. I trudged along for 5 years, didn't accrue any research experience, forged few relationships with professors, and became involved in clubs only at the end of my career. My GPA settled at a 3.0 upon graduation. Some of these difficulties came from an hour commute to school, in conjunction with a 20-30 hour/week job as a dishwasher just frankly left me tired.

 I'm not afraid of being tired. I'm 25 and I've worked since I was 13 years old. My family (only my mom and my sister  in this country, as we're immigrants from Costa Rica)...we're a bunch of work-mules. If there's one thing my family has, it's work ethic. And I know I'm intelligent. But I digress. 

Having graduated, and still chasing the faint notion of an M.D, I studied for the MCAT and hated every minute of it. I couldn't justify, nor did I want to, become a physician. 

At this point, I reached a somewhat critical juncture in my life. Two things happened in December of 2013: I began seeing a therapist and also began doing research as a post-bacc with my Biochemistry professor from Undergrad, who was kind enough to offer me a spot helping further a project.

Therapy was certainly revelatory. My therapist concluded that I'd suffered from Dysthimia, Anxiety, and paranoid ideation. The dysthimia probably began (we concluded) at least a decade ago. For some perspective, the first time I thought about suicide I was 12 years old. It's my observation that my dysthimia probably would have been full-grade depression had it not been for my mother keeping me active in athletics virtually all my life (natural endorphins and all that, which are apparently at about as effective as actual anti-depressants). I'd always suffered from poor self-image, horribly low confidence, and a horribly ingrained self-defeatist mentality, which though I kept that to myself, did not aid in any successes.  

As far as laboratory is concerned, the experience helped me narrow down what I feel I should be doing in that while I enjoy science, learned much about experimental design and different techniques and the like... I just don't feel I would have been a good scientist (aside from maybe pursuing engineering). 

Along this period of time, I became much more involved in educating myself politically. I've now delved into studies on government, and political theory, human rights issues and history...and man does that make me tick. The one fundamental difference I noticed between what I majored in and what I study now is that while biological science was interesting...I never asked any questions. I didn't have a curiosity for it beyond the courses I was taking. However, when I return from work each and every day and study the aforementioned subjects I'm constantly in wonderment, and asking questions, and thinking about things to research...it's this driving curiosity that wasn't there before. I mean, this is what I do. I come home and enjoy studying texts of academic rigor on all of those subjects. I've fallen in love with comparative politics and international relations, which I know is broad but those two fields are so incredibly interesting.

Anyway. In June I began seeing a psychiatrist. She said I have ADHD, which I began to suspect given my difficulties at work (I managed to talk my way into a job as a Microbiologist), and my prior difficulties in academia. In addition, apparently those afflicted are predisposed towards depression and anxiety, and sometimes bipolar disorder. Needless to say, everything at least made some sort of sense. It's something akin to knowing your money is being stolen and knowing who is doing the stealing. Whether I found out now or earlier wouldn't have made much of a difference; My mom's always struggled financially and we've never had health insurance. It wasn't until this year that I finally had cash to finally figure all this out. 

But my love for these kinds of studies isn't really just an end in itself. I want to do something with it. I have to do something with it. I come from a family that has known poverty: my mom grew up on a banana plantation in the poorest province of Costa Rica and was shuttled from home to home, sometimes within an abusive household, my grandmother managed a 6th grade education, was raped and abused as a child, beat by a former husband as a woman...my uncle used to do cocaine and steal...my father's never been present and has never acknowledged me or divulged my existence to my other siblings, I was sexually abused by my best friends older brother when I was a young kid... my mother's financial struggles caused an inordinate amount of stresses in and of themselves...so obviously there exist many issues around the globe that are personal. I empathize, but they also certainly mean something different. I look at something such as diplomacy, or the theories that educate diplomacy, and see myself as someone who could contribute within that arena. 

 I understand that life is unfair. But it's fair in that it is also unfair for everyone. So I'm really, really trying to work with what I understand and have been given and am coming to people who may have advice on what steps I might take to be a success. 



So that's where I'm at. I'm sitting here with 2 degrees, a 3.0 GPA, a new understanding of myself, struggles overcome...etc. I don't particularly subscribe to the idea of closed doors, so that's good. I just finished working something near 80 hours per week for the last 7 months, so I'm no stranger to hard work. I'm intelligent, and I'm more than willing to work towards acquiring the skills that might make me someone capable. I've read plenty of stories online of individuals who maybe struggled academically as I did, and still managed admission to incredible institutions (Harvard Kennedy School, Yale, Stanford, Georgetown...etc) so there is obviously still a way. I don't mean to imply that those institutions are what I am entitled to, but if I work hard and with diligence, I can obviously attend a great program. I guess it might be the academic version of reaching for the moon and landing among the stars, or whatever. 

I need to take a step, any step, in a forward direction, but have no idea where to proceed. My initial plan was applying for readmission to UCF to study their International Relations, or Political Science, or even Economics B.A. programs, and then apply to graduate school, having the experience and understanding I do now. But I certainly need help because I know I cannot do this alone.

Gemini725,t2_3u2gyd0n,2019-09-13 22:41:26,d3wuvt,0," 

I graduated last year with a bachelor's degree in interdisciplinary studies. Until recently, I was 100% sure I wanted to attend graduate school, hoping to first earn an M.A. in American History and then proceed to a Ph.D. I graduated with a 3.93 GPA and 6 graduate level history courses, but I never took more than 12 credits at a time and did not work at all throughout undergrad.

My major setback came during my final undergraduate semester. It was a pretty stressful time for me because I experienced housing insecurity for over half the semester and was moving every few days until my living situation finally stabilized. This happened to coincide with the semester I was taking a graduate level history class not only in the very area I wanted to study but with a professor that I greatly admired. The course included a 25 page (min.) research paper, however, because of my housing situation, I had a much later start on the paper than planned. (I should also mention that I have an anxiety disorder that impairs my ability to handle stress.)

Additionally, I had asked the professor to be my adviser about a month before the semester ended, but after she explained that she was retiring, I fell into a depression which impaired my concentration. Furthermore, I later decided to change topics and had to start from the beginning (which was admittedly petulant, but I was depressed over her not being my adviser). Long story short, I ended up starting the paper less than a week before it was due and it was written in a horrible state of mind. I ended up receiving an A- on it, but there were egregious typos/mistakes and formatting/citation errors. Additionally, it was barely 25 pages (I hoped for something twice that length) and only used about 15 sources which only included 2 books (the rest journal articles). It gets better...the professor actually gave me a one day extension (and then another day), but when she said she ""wasn't pleased"" with having to do it, my depression deepened and I was barely able to concentrate on the revisions. Sometimes I think the final draft was actually worse than the original...

Also, based on her feedback, I could tell that even the A- was given out of sympathy (I got an A in the course), and at that point I doubted that she saw me as graduate school material. (She knew about the housing situation and that I changed topics late in the semester, but she didn't know about my depression \[and it was situation and not clinical\]). Our relationship subsequently soured when I reported her to the department chair for what I perceived was a curt response to another email I sent her as well the fact that she ignored the follow-up email (and also mentioned her saying that she ""wasn't pleased"" etc.) I later tried to apologize for overreacting and explained my anxiety disorder(which is documented) and that I felt depressed that she couldn't be my adviser, but she ignored this email and the next one I sent (both requesting letters of recommendation).

I posted some of this in more detail on the ""Ask Professors of Reddit"" sub, and while the consensus seems to be that I ruined our relationship when I went to the chair, I still can't help but wonder if she simply didn't think I was capable of graduate school because of that paper. While there were extenuating circumstances for it, the fact was that the quality was affected. It seems the type of undergrads that go on to graduate studies are the ones who could write a perfect research paper in one or two nights regardless of how anxious or depressed they're feeling. I tend to be a perfectionist and think it's important to find the right sources, read through them thoroughly etc., but again, maybe I should have been able to do all that within a few days (especially with the extensions) regardless of my state of mind. I'm also starting to question how I would be able to handle the course load of graduate school while simultaneously teaching courses and doing multiple research projects (on top of a thesis) etc. With all that said, I really enjoy research/writing (despite this setback) and still hope to attend, but I want to have a realistic idea of what I'm getting into. Have I been too hard on myself over this paper or does it sound like I might struggle in graduate school? (Again, I""m hoping to start with an M.A. but then go on to a Ph.D.) I would appreciate honest feedback.",AskAcademia,Am I Cut Out for Graduate School?
ekkso,,2018-06-14 16:32:30,8r397m,0,"Here's some backstory. Im an IT Computer Support Specialist major. I have fairly severe Attention Deficit Disorder and Depression that comes in waves. I've signed up for accommodation support through my school to assist me in this and to have it on file. 

Now to the real story.

In my first year of college my medication was too expensive to afford, as I HAD to buy the name brand stuff and my insurance deductible wasn't paid. That's $300 out of pocket. This put me in a tight spot. I wasn't taking school as seriously as I should have, and I was working a lot and going to school full time. The high school I went to did not give the ACT resources I needed to take that, so I had to take the accuplacer test through my college to better gauge me for my prerequisites and generals. I scored highly but failed in math and had to take Pre Algebra. On my first year I got a couple incompletes and failed 2 classes as well, which this caused my GPA to plummit. The weight of being full time college and 35+ hours a week in work was too much for me to handle and because of this year of failed classes I ended up getting suspended for a semester. I appealed and came back only to do poorly again in one class. My GPA cumulative rating ended up being .889 before my suspension. This academic probation also limited me to only being able to take 6 credits. This meant I had to boost my GPA cumulatively all the way to 2.0 while boosting my semester and cumulative completion rate to at least 60% (which I did) all within 2 classes. This is not possible. This issue, despite me doing so well on my recovery semester, caused me to be suspended again, along with removing my ability to get financial aid. At this point I'm wondering if I should change schools or if I should go through with the appeal process and hope they lift all the restrictions on my classes so I can get to the threshold. My cumulative GPA ending on the semester after my 2nd suspension was 1.875. just barely under what I needed. Semester GPA was 3.2",AskAcademia,Suspended Twice from Technical School.

melliO6,t2_mq39x,2019-09-22 22:57:40,d7xx9a,0,"I am at the University of Houston taking some pretty low-level classes, I have severe depression and anxiety and I am thinking about dropping out and learning on my own time. I am extremely fluent in neuroscience, biology, psychology. My math is meh, but functional. I am computer science capable, never really been challenged to do anything too advanced and I find it semi-dull to do without a project. I also probably have the clinical experience of a master's student in counseling because I quite literally lived in therapy for a year, been to mental hospitals, prior to 5 years of intensive therapy, groups, AA, have had mostly mentally ill friends and upwards of 12 therapists/psychiatrists in various contexts. I love the historiography of psychiatry... etc. I am a big mental health and society nerd. I can also 3d model and I have animated someone's cancer bio Ph.D. thesis before for fun which was estimated at 15,000 shellings LOL...(if anyone needs some graphical abstracts I work for advice/conversation cause I simply enjoy making them and learning about projects!!!) my point is I can barely get myself out of bed, eating at a surplus of food is an achievement, and the only thing that gets me out of bed is the sheer joy of learning. I am completely failing to do this in a structured environment, I have had really really bad dysgraphia which makes it very time consuming to do ""non-objective based"" work. I learn by doing very much. I have had an internship at M.D. Anderson and I did so much better than expected considering I was a low functioning high school student at the time. I gave a great presentation, somehow I have quite the stage presence in spite of my terrible social anxiety.  I am horrible at showing up to class and doing the in-class pop quizzes which are standard at UH, I have missed every test, I can't get myself to go to class... I mean I know I can force myself to go and I do, it's just I cannot keep it up. I get so bored and anxious in lectures, and I know I can learn all the material on my own if I saw the point or if it was delivered in a more meaningful fashion.   
Right now I am considering getting a job where I have to be there (a commitment device for existence lmao...) like construction, or service (which I have worked before and did a little bit better) and can be less of a leach on my dad financially. I am mildly well connected I guess, hence my very nepotistically achieved the internship (I stuck out like a sore thumb compared to the high functioning, accomplished, and totally awesome international students!) But what are connections when I can't even get a simple degree, because its ""too easy and dull"" but I would no doubt still struggle regardless. My situation reminds me of a twisted and far more realistic Goodwill Hunting. Averagejoe Hunting perhaps? As I know if I could apply myself its not as though I would immediately be hired by the department of the defense merely for the biggest boy brain. I read neuroscience, psych, psychiatry, physics, etc. out of sheer interest and its the only time I do not feel so hopeless. I have recently been getting into mycological analogies to brain function and its pertinence to how the brain navigates social networks, and developed evolutionarily (downloaded a cool logical simulation software and I am going to try to recreate neuronal ""sexual communication"" given synaptic pruning, sensitization, habituation, potentiation, and glial nutrition to see if following the same principles of slime mold apply to neurons, I have found a lot of similar mechanisms with obscured by seemingly different biological manifestations of similar principles!)   
I have been called Rick Sanchez recently, which while sure its a nice compliment considering who you could get as a depressive, its sad... I want colleagues! I want my life to have contributed to a body of literature that can solve genuine human problems! I just am floundering so tremendously on paper, and I feel like I am accelerating in my education off the books if you will. It's frustrating... people talk to me and think I must be a superstar student but I'm just wasted potential at best.   
What are the possibilities of someone coming into academics from this angle? Could I ever become involved in an institution without a degree through sheer merit alone? Could journals accept (assume to be exquisite for sake of argument) theory, as I don't exactly have a lab..., from unaffiliated randoms? Does anyone have any advice for me? I have thought about starting a youtube channel, (like ""What I've learned"" but I don't know if that would really help me get into academia. I want to help people with depression, borderline personality, and frankly anything that causes misery. I want to mature badly but my depression is fundamentally resistant as it is likely the comingling of a personality disorder, trauma, and genuine common cold depression/anxiety since I was in seventh grade, I am 18 rn.

I found a job and, although the work environment itself was great. The lack of intellectual challenge in the nature of the work started to cause me anxiety. For months I tried to find a solution so I applied to a foreign school because it was the only school that had applications open at the time. I got in, but after budgeting I wouldn't have enough money to live there for the 2 years of the program and chickened out at the last minute.  


This just made my anxiety and depression worse. The lack of intellectual challenge and the prospect of not being able to do research for a really long time was driving me crazy. So I tried reaching out to a professor at a local university to try to do an RA ship. I started doing the RA ship while working, but it now turns out that the RA ship is essentially the same kind of non intellectually challenging work (I am writing documentation and refactoring a code base + fixing bugs). And after talking to the professor, it essentially looks like he feels that just getting a recommendation letter from him to be able to do grad school later on should be what matters to me (he wouldn't be wrong).   


Now I don't know what to do, I am absolutely miserable, I have been crying myself to sleep on and off for the last month. I understand he has done me a great favour. I understand I am being entitled, I understand that all careers have their negatives. But I did this entire thing to do intellectual work, not to get a recommendation letter. I know how entitled this sounds but, I am not even sure I will be able to do a good work. I did this to be able to handle my depression and it only made it worse, I already have a job and money, it's fulfillment that I am lacking.  


Now if I walk away from the RA ship, which is objectively making my quality of life worse, I can say goodbye to any chances of getting into my local university. On the other hand, if I stay I risk not being able to do a good work and still not get a recommendation letter + some more nefarious consequences.

for the sake of saving the lab (big big name lab) that I was going to as a post-doc from losing a PhD grant application because there was no other student accepting the project (basically they were ghosting the lab and the lab is a very big lab in the field so imagine why) I accepted that I would apply as a PhD student in the lab and there would be no difference between this and junior post-doc.

 I used to be exceptionally gifted in pipetting and technical stuff, very independent with my own ideas and projects and stuff that I was proposing that I would eventually see in top-tier journals (my let's say No1 advisor was declining for money issues pissing me off and making me depressed). 

However, during the process, my supervisor (not the advisor) really was treating me like an inferior (like ACTUAL PHD STUDENT) so we had a lot of conflict. Basically, in this lab all post-docs were fighting passive aggressively one another behind their backs ( tragic irony, my advisor speaks romantically about collaboration and help one another in research while there is blood in his labfloor - I am crying from laughter). Basically also, my supervisor is hated by everyone and is called the secret son of the advisor. Basically in addition, the former post-doc that proposed that I should go to his lab told me specifically not to work with this supervisor because he is an idiot and an as/le.

 For not having trouble with the funding agency I had to unsubscribe from my previous PhD program, so advisor No1 was really pissed off and stopped talking to me - also didn't publish our two papers!!! Eventually, the relationship with the as/e supervisor deteriorated and although I finished my PhD with them, he 1. didn't submit my paper, 2. led me to severe depression from killing parts of my project 3. killed 3 of my collaborations and lied to the advisor (like that I didn't like this project and was asking to join another and all crazy staf!)  4. defamed me as he led me to depression and for a period of time I was not that gifted in pipetting (actually, I didn't want to see a pipette in my life ever again) 5. distorts the truth to everyone,  taking advantage of me not wanting to harm the lab by going to the integrity office and not having enough evidence as well, because I am such an IDIOT that I learnt that you can actually record what is being only discussed and never put on paper at the last year of my ""PhD study"".

Background:

I graduated from the University of Central Florida in May 2013 after completing degrees in Biotechnology and Bio-medical Sciences. My undergraduate career was a somewhat misguided affair, influenced both by my inability to choose an academic path ( I simply didn't know what I wanted to do) and my mother's somewhat pervasive idea that she'd delight in my becoming a doctor. So that's what I tried for. As much as I tried convincing myself I'd become a doctor, I didn't truly believe it, and I didn't truly want it. And so, given that the means didn't justify the ends...I struggled. I trudged along for 5 years, didn't accrue any research experience, forged few relationships with professors, and became involved in clubs only at the end of my career. My GPA settled at a 3.0 upon graduation. Some of these difficulties came from an hour commute to school, in conjunction with a 20-30 hour/week job as a dishwasher just frankly left me tired.

 I'm not afraid of being tired. I'm 25 and I've worked since I was 13 years old. My family (only my mom and my sister  in this country, as we're immigrants from Costa Rica)...we're a bunch of work-mules. If there's one thing my family has, it's work ethic. And I know I'm intelligent. But I digress. 

Having graduated, and still chasing the faint notion of an M.D, I studied for the MCAT and hated every minute of it. I couldn't justify, nor did I want to, become a physician. 

At this point, I reached a somewhat critical juncture in my life. Two things happened in December of 2013: I began seeing a therapist and also began doing research as a post-bacc with my Biochemistry professor from Undergrad, who was kind enough to offer me a spot helping further a project.

Therapy was certainly revelatory. My therapist concluded that I'd suffered from Dysthimia, Anxiety, and paranoid ideation. The dysthimia probably began (we concluded) at least a decade ago. For some perspective, the first time I thought about suicide I was 12 years old. It's my observation that my dysthimia probably would have been full-grade depression had it not been for my mother keeping me active in athletics virtually all my life (natural endorphins and all that, which are apparently at about as effective as actual anti-depressants). I'd always suffered from poor self-image, horribly low confidence, and a horribly ingrained self-defeatist mentality, which though I kept that to myself, did not aid in any successes.  

As far as laboratory is concerned, the experience helped me narrow down what I feel I should be doing in that while I enjoy science, learned much about experimental design and different techniques and the like... I just don't feel I would have been a good scientist (aside from maybe pursuing engineering). 

Along this period of time, I became much more involved in educating myself politically. I've now delved into studies on government, and political theory, human rights issues and history...and man does that make me tick. The one fundamental difference I noticed between what I majored in and what I study now is that while biological science was interesting...I never asked any questions. I didn't have a curiosity for it beyond the courses I was taking. However, when I return from work each and every day and study the aforementioned subjects I'm constantly in wonderment, and asking questions, and thinking about things to research...it's this driving curiosity that wasn't there before. I mean, this is what I do. I come home and enjoy studying texts of academic rigor on all of those subjects. I've fallen in love with comparative politics and international relations, which I know is broad but those two fields are so incredibly interesting.

Anyway. In June I began seeing a psychiatrist. She said I have ADHD, which I began to suspect given my difficulties at work (I managed to talk my way into a job as a Microbiologist), and my prior difficulties in academia. In addition, apparently those afflicted are predisposed towards depression and anxiety, and sometimes bipolar disorder. Needless to say, everything at least made some sort of sense. It's something akin to knowing your money is being stolen and knowing who is doing the stealing. Whether I found out now or earlier wouldn't have made much of a difference; My mom's always struggled financially and we've never had health insurance. It wasn't until this year that I finally had cash to finally figure all this out. 

But my love for these kinds of studies isn't really just an end in itself. I want to do something with it. I have to do something with it. I come from a family that has known poverty: my mom grew up on a banana plantation in the poorest province of Costa Rica and was shuttled from home to home, sometimes within an abusive household, my grandmother managed a 6th grade education, was raped and abused as a child, beat by a former husband as a woman...my uncle used to do cocaine and steal...my father's never been present and has never acknowledged me or divulged my existence to my other siblings, I was sexually abused by my best friends older brother when I was a young kid... my mother's financial struggles caused an inordinate amount of stresses in and of themselves...so obviously there exist many issues around the globe that are personal. I empathize, but they also certainly mean something different. I look at something such as diplomacy, or the theories that educate diplomacy, and see myself as someone who could contribute within that arena. 

 I understand that life is unfair. But it's fair in that it is also unfair for everyone. So I'm really, really trying to work with what I understand and have been given and am coming to people who may have advice on what steps I might take to be a success. 



So that's where I'm at. I'm sitting here with 2 degrees, a 3.0 GPA, a new understanding of myself, struggles overcome...etc. I don't particularly subscribe to the idea of closed doors, so that's good. I just finished working something near 80 hours per week for the last 7 months, so I'm no stranger to hard work. I'm intelligent, and I'm more than willing to work towards acquiring the skills that might make me someone capable. I've read plenty of stories online of individuals who maybe struggled academically as I did, and still managed admission to incredible institutions (Harvard Kennedy School, Yale, Stanford, Georgetown...etc) so there is obviously still a way. I don't mean to imply that those institutions are what I am entitled to, but if I work hard and with diligence, I can obviously attend a great program. I guess it might be the academic version of reaching for the moon and landing among the stars, or whatever. 

I need to take a step, any step, in a forward direction, but have no idea where to proceed. My initial plan was applying for readmission to UCF to study their International Relations, or Political Science, or even Economics B.A. programs, and then apply to graduate school, having the experience and understanding I do now. But I certainly need help because I know I cannot do this alone.

I didn't tell anyone about it because I was afraid that would make it worse, but I ended up with a 0 in one class I never went to and a D+ in another where I never turned in my final paper. I passed my two other classes simply because the professors saw how obvious my symptoms were and gave me their largesse. I asked for a grade change to incomplete because the school already knew I had severe depression after I took 1.5 years off for it and got an underload, but they decided a chronically mentally ill person wasn't (understandably) worth their time so they let me graduate with my current dogshit transcript.

Even though all hope of Ivy League prestige and status and a financially comfortable 20s is behind me, I still want to go for a master's and possibly a PhD and switch to economics as my field.

I always wanted to be in academia when I was young, and I did enjoy my time in it while I was (albeit in a limited capacity due to the aforementioned depression). 

All that being said, while I really want to get back into it, I wonder if it's too late to do anything meaningful. I worry about credentials, and I have somewhat of a crippling lack in self-confidence as it is.

So basically, assuming I'm right, and academia is for me (or would be, anyhow) is it worthwhile to try and get back into it?

I'm currently in my third semester (I'm an undergraduate) and this past month and a half has been the toughest and most stressful time so far. Things went *really* well last year and I passed all my exams with good grades but things aren't going so well right now. I have *no idea* how to pass my current course/class.

Ever since I decided what to study (which was quite a few years ago but I took a few gap years between high school and university, which is common to do here) I've known what I want. I wanted to study to get a bachelor's degree, master's degree and then earn a PhD and go into medical research in either neuroscience, biomedicine or infection biology. However, this summer I was accepted to a summer research program where I got to work in a real research lab and I realized working in such a lab isn't really what I thought it'd be like. I didn't dislike it or anything but it wasn't really what I expected it to be (perhaps that's just because I'm an undergraduate and I don't know that much yet).

Since then I've sort of doubted my goal. What if I don't want to spend my whole life in a research lab? What if I won't like it? I don't really know what to do with my life. I know I want an education and I know I don't want to work with anything but science, but I don't really know what to do with that right now.

Doubting my goal, being a perfectionist, dealing with depression and stuff plus all the stress at university are all factors that have led to my motivation being virtually non-existent nowadays. I don't feel motivated at all and since I'm dependent on motivation to actually do well at university, I feel like I'm not doing that well right now. That, in turn, makes me even less motivated so now I'm stuck in some sort of vicious cycle of stress and despair and I don't know how to get inspired and motivated again.

I know I can't be the only student going through these things so I thought I'd reach out here and see if any of you have any advice (I hope this is the appropriate subreddit for this).

[deleted],,2014-08-08 00:49:10,2cxqtr,0,"TLDR - College student in search of scholarships for people with Refractory Depression, ADHD combined-type, and/or General Anxiety Disorder. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm a 21 year old from the Midwest (USA), and I'm currently in the process of re-enrolling at a very prestigious university. I originally went to college upon graduating high school, and I was lucky enough to be chosen to take part in a leadership/philanthropy scholar program, which only accepted 22 applicants out of a pool of 4000; it's a program through my university. Additionally, I have strong relationships with several top professors and administrators (i.e. people who can move mountains). I'm telling you all of this to explain why it's so important for me to re-enroll at this school in particular, rather than going to a cheaper (and far less prestigious) alternative.

My problem: I've withdrawn twice on a ""Medical Leave of Absence"" due to my mental health issues, and, consequently, I've lost eligibility for several scholarships due to taking time off. I have a 3.7+ GPA, so no problems there.

My parents are willing to help pay, but no more than 1/5 of the total cost. I have one scholarship to cover 2/5 of the total cost. This leaves me with 2/5 to cover, or about $15,000ish. Because of my mental health problems, I haven't been able to maintain steady employment to save up money. The real drag is that I don't qualify for much financial aid due to my parents' high income (approximately $300,000/year), and they don't feel obligated to contribute more than $6-7,000 per semester. They also refuse to cosign on any loans, so that's not an option. The only loans I can get without a cosigner are federal loans, which aren't near enough to cover the gap.

I'm looking for scholarships/grants for those affected by mental/emotional disorders, or ANY others I may qualify for. I have Refractory Depression (Treatment Resistant Depression; Chronic Depression), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, severe ADHD combined-type, a couple random learning disabilities, possible Bipolar Disorder, probable OCD, and if I think of any others I'll add them later.

My academic focuses:

1) History major - with a focus on pre-Civil War US and African American history (history of American slavery), as well as Gender/Sexuality history, and public policy spanning all the aforementioned.

2) Math/Statistics - focusing on building/applying statistical models to sociological-esque research

3) Writing (minor) - I've been hired professionally as a writer and editor, as well as tutoring writing

My eventual goal is to either pursue a history phd and go into academia, or working at a thinktank dealing with public policy.

Sorry for the multiple digressions, and thank you for taking the time to read this. Please let me know if you have any advice on what I can do!!

tweees,t2_fxhxj,2014-03-31 17:04:38,21uaxf,0,"Hi everyone! I’m in need of academic advisement, so I was hoping someone on here can offer me some insight.

I attend a state university and have about a year left before I complete my undergraduate degree in the sciences. However, I’ve been extremely dissatisfied with my education because my learning style just isn’t compatible with the traditional classroom. I try to grind my way through at the pace of the class, but, oftentimes, I can’t keep up and end up failing classes every semester. Needless to say, my GPA is absolute shit, and I’m constantly on my university’s “warning” list. On the other hand, I excel in my lab courses and any other course where I get to work closely with the professor because I get to make my own learning timeline but still finish strong by the deadline. I know that I am capable of succeeding academically because my professors have praised my work and constantly send me off to conferences to represent our school. I genuinely love to learn and just want to do things at my own pace without worrying about being disqualified from great opportunities because I don’t have the GPA to back up what I can do. I’ve literally had breakdowns and was diagnosed for clinical depression because of my academic standing. My school’s administration isn’t helpful at all because they’ve turned me away for almost everything. For example, I got extremely sick one semester and brought in medical documentation to apply for a semester withdrawal, but they basically said “too bad” and I ended up failing every single class that semester from being out of school. I’m absolutely exhausted from being stuck on “survival mode” these past few years and was wondering if there is anything I can do to make things easier for me from now on and get a more fulfilling education. I'm also open to other options for finishing my degree. ",AskAcademia,Unsuccessful in traditional classroom. Advise?
mooneys_purple_coat,t2_ph4jc,2015-10-08 07:29:51,3ny1cy,0,"I apologize for the interminable length of this thing (I'm now reminded of the pinned tweet currently on Matt Zoller Seitz's Twitter page -- ""**Q**: *Tell me an important life lesson you've learned.* **A:** *Nobody cares as much about what you're going through as you do*""). I would really appreciate it if anyone could take a look at what I've written, though. I welcome any advice, guidance, or anything of that sort. 

The title is a little inaccurate, BTW, as I clearly do have a few ""clues"" about what to do next, but I'm still feeling ridiculously uncertain. I'm terribly adrift. After committing so much of my time and energy to the pursuit of a BA, and then an MA, I wound up in a bit of a personal morass (for many complicated reasons). Following my MA, I decided to see if I could make it in the ""real world,"" and then spent a few years being almost completely disregarded by retail hiring managers (almost *no one* has hired me in the ensuing time since I completed my MA, and I've sent out consistent applications; consequently, I've been *unemployed for three years*). I've become way too accustomed to impersonal, boilerplate rejection letters. 

Not surprisingly, I have since reached new levels of sadness and desperation. Even the positions I thought I could acquire, with film festivals and the like, have revealed themselves to be woefully inaccessible. I've pored over my cover letters, made countless minute adjustments, sought out (and completed) volunteer work to goose up my resume, and I still feel like I'm still struggling to gain any purchase on anything resembling an adult life.

I admit that, in addition to my sense of accomplishment, a sense of assurance attended the completion of my MA, and I foolishly assumed that I would be able to get some work at a film festival with some reasonable measure of rapidity and ease. It didn't work out that way, as the imprimatur of academia doesn't guarantee success in all fields (even those which seem closely related to your studies). My paucity of non-academic experience is, understandably, a problem for some of the places I'm applying to (although, no one -- neither in retail or at a film festival -- has actually ever gone out of their way to explain their reasoning for rejecting my repeated applications, despite my attempts at requesting such guidance). 

In addition to these struggles, my mental health took a severe dip, my girlfriend of nearly seven years broke up with me, and my mother became a widow. I cannot leaven any of the pain I'm feeling with a sense of direction or purpose, which is what I am so desperately craving. This is partly why I think about a PhD often, as I miss the sense of direction and hope that I sustained while I pursued my undergraduate and graduate studies. 

So, now, as the spectre of the rest of my life looms before me, and my anxiety mounts, I'm beginning to wonder what will become of me. In the Atoms for Peace song, [""Before Your Very Eyes,""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWrUEsVrdSU) Thom Yorke expresses something of the terror of misspent and fleeting time:

&gt;
- Look out of the window /
- What is passing you by /
- If you really want this bad enough /
- You’re young and good looking /
- The keys to the kingdom /
- Sooner or later (x3) /
- And before your very eyes (x3) /
- Old soul on young shoulders /
- How you’ll look when you’re older /
- Time's fickle card game with you and I /
- You have to take your chances /
- The book of forgiveness /
- Sooner or later (x3) /
- And before your very eyes (x3) /

This sort of thing has been on my mind a lot. I'm coming across rather dramatic, I realize, but, given the desperation of my situation and how badly I would like relief, I believe my tone is warranted (in hindsight, some of this may sound like I'm hinting that I'm contemplating suicide, which is certainly not the case). Yorke's lyrics also suggest that there might still be time enough, but I really have to steel myself to adopt more charitable views, as I'm quite beset by depression and anxiety. 

As I mentioned, I've considered returning to school to pursue a PhD, but some of the impassioned arguments against that path (from those who have pursued it themselves) have been discouraging to say the least. Despite this, on some days, it seems like the clouds suddenly part, and it becomes clear to me that a PhD in Film Studies is in fact my proper calling. At such times, I remind myself that this inkling is borne out by my enthusiasm and work ethic during the pursuit of my BA and MA (and my nostalgic regard for that period). So, I'll be hit by such epiphanies while, for example, in the shower, following one of my usual bouts of frenzied thinking, and I'll suddenly feel the brief elation of clarity. Sure enough, however, by the time I'm stepping out of the shower, I'm already second-guessing everything. The clarity is ephemeral, and always succeeded by many different flavours of niggling doubt. 

Some of these doubts are tied into my youthful aspiration to create stories, and my more dreamy but impractical ideas about life's finite terms and the need to aim for what would really make you happiest (which isn't always the most  feasible object). I would still love to pursue a career where creativity is essential, whether that means writing fiction, like I used to dream about when I was a small lad, or trying to put together a film, or something of that nature. I don't want to fully turn my back on that part of myself (a part, I should add, that I never really got the chance to indulge after absorbing myself in my academic studies).

At the same time, I do love writing about film, and that is in and of itself a form of rewarding creativity. I do not want to give the impression that this would not suffice, or would be a compromise. I'm often torn, however, between the respective pleasures of film criticism and scholarship. I like both, but I feel like there's no clear way to really imbricate these two worlds into a profession. On the one hand, the prospect of a PhD is daunting and I question whether or not it's the right fit for me, but the idea of film criticism is accompanied by its own challenges (for starters, it's not exactly a conventional career path). 

So, while I would very much like to pursue criticism via freelance writing, I know that's a risky gambit and I'm quite uncertain about the viability of such an occupation. Plus, there are a lot of related issues that trouble me (let's put it this way, I recently entered the following two words into Google: ""freelancing"" ""pension"").

This sorry predicament has left me, in a desultory and anxious manner, to wander the Internet in hope of alighting upon some kind of answer or eureka moment. My latest discovery is a two year degree in film or photographic preservation. I wonder if this is my solution: it's a choice that dovetails with my passionate interest in cinema, and it may eventually provide me with a career and something like financial stability. But I don't know that for sure, and I'm really quite frightened of wasting even more time. 

If there's anyone out there who can speak to this or any of the other issues I brought up, please feel free to do so.

Dropped out and went back many times. I have a few courses on my record where I basically never went to class or submitted anything, and ended up with stupid low grades like 32%. I don't remember exactly what my GPA is, but it's around 2.0 or less. This is at a pretty good university in Ontario, Canada, by the way, and it's only a 3-year BA, which I decided to settle for once my problems got really bad. 

Anyway, practically all my friends have done or are doing a Master's, and I honestly don't know if academia is a good or even a possible path for me, given my rough history--but I have felt that it's my true calling for many years, if I could just get my personal issues sorted. (Still working on that.) 

I'm hoping to avoid retaking the low-grade courses since they're so expensive nowadays--around $700 each now, for admission alone. That's not counting the cost of transportation, lost working hours, etc. Searching other submissions on here about low GPAs has taught me that it's apparently possible to take Graduate-level courses without being enrolled in the program, which is something I'd rather invest money in to find out for myself/prove that I can succeed at that level. Being able to enroll in an MA program would still be a ways off for me no matter what, because I still have to learn to cope with my mental handicaps, but if there's even a small chance, I'd like to start working on the steps since I'm getting into my upper 20s now.

How often do you meet mentally healthy individuals in academia? If possible, treat students and professors as separate groups.

Edit: To be clear, ""poor mental health"" doesn't mean they need to go to a psychiatric ward. ""Poor mental health"" means they act against their best interests due to a mental hang-up.

8476929299,t2_wxhjn,2016-04-06 22:16:41,4do416,0,"Hello,

My apologies for the dramatic title. In a bit of a crisis. I am supposed to graduate in May (so a month and a half or so) but am pretty borderline in terms of satisfactory grades to succeed.

Not going to bother you too much with my history, but I was valedictorian of my high school class, great teacher recs, did tons of sports/community service/etc. (grew up in an environment where college admissions seemed like the life goal.....guess I never really thought about what it would be like once I got there though). Not to sound like I am bragging or something, because now I am the complete opposite---I actually had to abandon my intended major because I wouldn't be able to retake certain classes plus all of the other ones I needed to take and graduate on time. Now I am stuck with a major I honestly don't care about at all, enjoy, and leads to nothing (especially since I don't have the grades for any grad program in the entire world). I was even on academic probation one semester (which honestly didn't really affect my life at all as no privileges were taken away from me) but did get off it (not with outstanding grades, but bare minimum or higher to be off it)

I am part-time this semester (had enough credits that I didn't need to take any more, and if I did, it would cost money) and am taking 2 classes, both of which are required for my major. For major classes, you have to get a C or above for it to count (believe me, I already had to retake two....). I just got my midterm report and I have a D because I apparently bombed our midterm (the only grade so far except for homeworks, which I've done well on). What I'm really upset about is that I was honestly shocked and thought I had done an alright job. That is how every single test, paper, etc. in college has gone. If I went in and literally knew nothing and froze up and made something up, yeah, I'd expect a fail. But that's never happened to me. I do feel like I put in work but I just don't get results for whatever reason.

Anyways, I went to talk to the professor today, and honestly, reviewing the midterm doesn't do shit since it's material we won't be tested on for the final, and every question is sort of situational to itself. But I sat there and she told me what I did wrong, not that it would help me for the final (don't know how to explain since I know some people will challenge this statement, but it's just not carryover material/processes/etc). 

Okay so here's where we get into the real question: so I am in a huge crisis here. If I even get a C- I won't graduate. My parents live in another CONTINENT for that matter, and I can't ask them to buy plane tickets for graduation and then tell them I'm not actually graduating the day after the final. I told her of course I know she can't just ""give"" me a C, but I just don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong and like I said, everything is situational to itself, so nothing we've done will help me. 

So I'm honestly pretty suicidal over the idea of not graduating because a) clearly something has gone wrong that I'm unable to identify since this has been consistent for years (my guess is maybe adult ADHD? I am diagnosed, but that was about a year ago and the past wasn't really discussed in my diagnosis) b) I really need to get out of the school environment c) no degree = no job = no money = no way to survive.

More context: I have been depressed since I was 10, chronic anxiety since then too, developed social anxiety a few years ago as well. So suicidal feelings are't new, but I feel like my depression keeps snowballing from bad things happening, like this.

So question: What happens if a student were to hypothetically say they were suicidal in a professor's office, for example? I am curious simply because students are 18+.

I'm sorry this got too mental health-y but I am genuinely curious as to what the scenario is like.

**TL:DR feel like I am working hard yet poor results, on the brink of not graduating, panicking because need to get out of a school environment and parents need to potentially buy plane tickets for grad**",AskAcademia,"""Protocol"" if a professor knows you're suicidal?"
ihaveatoaster,t2_xcgrk,2016-04-22 13:41:35,4fyhps,0,"My boyfriend recently defended in a field with robust industry representation at a jaw-dropper school. In the past couple months or so, I have gone through relationship hell and don't know what this is, what I am, what he is, or what planet we are living on.

He has (medicated) depression and personal standards which cannot coexist with a debilitating mental illness. Prior to the thesis crunch (also, more or less when we started dating), he was a normal person. Sure, he was a little reticent and prone to melancholic contemplation, but he went hiking, threw parties, he had friends. Now, he has no support system outside of myself and his parents (and he doesn't want the latter). His social activity of the week is going to the gym. He works 9-10 hours a day, and mopes the rest of the time because he can't sleep. We've also had an episode of self-harm and an episode of suicide ideation. We're in some kind of contact every day, but I get pissed off when he can barely muster 2.5 sentences in 24 hours. He's still very sweet with me, but he's not affectionate, he doesn't do nice things for me anymore, and it's impossible to get him to do anything but work. I told myself I'll break up with him as soon as he defends, but now I'm reconsidering because I do care for him and think that he's objectively and subjectively a total package, if he weren't such a total knobhead.

While typing this out on the relationship subs, I've come to terms with my thoughts and emotions, and came to the conclusion that I could stand his constant exhaustion, his occasional self-sabotage, his lacking communication and sexual function if only I believed in his mission, but I don't. I am girlfriend-level familiar with his field and approximately intimately familiar with academia, and from my observations, for him to get from where he is to where he wants to be, it will take nothing short of a miracle. I can't tell him this because he knows it too, and also because hearing it from me might crush him, so I've been steadily advertising how great life is in industry (6 figures! Geographical mobility! You can take weekends off!), but so far, his response has been that industry is for lesser beings. What's frustrating is that he'd actually be really good in industry because he's not an acneous nerd, and he actually knows how to talk to people without getting punched in the face. I'm not a gold digging whore and I understand that he has to live out his dream to the lastest, but his postdoc is another 2 years, and when that's done, who's to say he won't get another one? He's also not getting any younger, and I'm scared that he'll miss out on the things he wants to do, like travel and buy non-sale items, in favor of a dream that will never pan out. Lastly, I don't know if I can survive this. I already got a therapist for my own issues, but 50% of that very expensive hour is spent ranting about my beloved non compos mentis. And it's not like I can get that shit comped, you know?

If it helps, he's also a pedant, an aesthete, a germaphobe, and a picky eater, which is mildly annoying.

NB: please don't ask for any names, because academics are thick as thieves and I'd bet money that some of you here know or have heard of him.",AskAcademia,My boyfriend wants to become a professor. Should I dump him?
sweetheartiam,,2018-01-09 18:13:12,7p8ywv,0,"Dear Financial Aid committee, I am appealing my federal aid ineligibility as a result of failing to meet SAP requirements during Academic Year 2017 Fall semester. I both understand the decision for dismissal and take responsibility for the actions that led up to it. I have written this letter in hopes of conveying the gravity with which I regard my academic future and the steps I have taken to remedy my current academic standing. The actions leading to my grades not meeting up to SAP standards were due stress due to taking too many courses and the depression and anxiety I contributed because of it. Before enrolment as a transfer student in 2016 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism.I went through a few doctor visits and was put on Levothyroxine medication which did at the time help with the depression and anxiety symptoms. In fall 2017 semester is when my refills of the medication went out , at this time is when I would start seeing the symptoms again.As a result of being off medication my stress and anxiety started to build up as it was the first semester in which I took more than 4 classes. This gave me constant insomnia, troublesome fatigue walking to class and constant just streaks of depression with academic scores not being met to standards that were I wanted them. At this time I did not seek any counselling for my depression and anxiety. In september though the end of the academic year I would see my advisor for academic advice on my major, as well as an attend academic peer coach session which started on 10/17/17 which in a way did help with insecurities about my academic decline. I have sought treatment for these issues and am currently on a new insurance plan and will have funds to buy more levothyroxine for my hypothyroidism in order to help my depression and anxiety symptoms. Appointments have been made on 1/9/18 to see a counselor for my depression issues until I am able to receive medication after my doctor check up in later date january. I have come up with an academic plan with my advisor which will enable me to make better academic decisions a choices in order to graduate in my major. I have also dropped my course load from 5 classes to 4 per semester and will be taking a break from accounting for a semester in replacement with an elective course as to not work myself which could result in an anxiety attack or stress overload. I have already started to attend harc in university suites center and will continue to go weekly as well as make tutoring appointments in academic success center as the semester workload starts to kick backup.

This is what I have so far, how is it? what would should I add, get rid of etc and grammar.

here are the sap rules: The SAP Appeal process requires the submission of a written statement by the student outlining the extenuating circumstances which led to their academic difficulties, how the circumstances have changed, and the student's plan for improving their academic status. The statement must be typed, signed by the student, and must specifically address the courses, grades, and terms of enrollment which are affecting the insufficient SAP standing. The statement should have correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation and should be written in a professional manner. The appeal must be accompanied by supporting documentation from at least two individuals who can corroborate the student's circumstances. If the documentation is provided by a professional (business, medical, counselor, clergy, etc.), the documentation must include the institution's professional letterhead, the professional's credentials, and must be signed. If a letter of support is provided by a personal reference (teacher, family friend, etc.), the documentation must be signed by that reference.",AskAcademia,"PLEASE help this is my second SAP APPEAL attempt as the first got denied.

So I'm going to be matched with an advisor on Sunday, based on what field I'm interested in, so (s)he can help me with my thesis. 

Additional note: I am a woman in (and from) Saudi Arabia.

I'm not sure what *medical* thing I'm interested in (don't ask me why I'm a doctor), but a cultural thing I am extremely invested in is Islam vs women.

**Is it a good master's thesis to study the effect of hijab on mental health? I'm only asking about the academic merit.**

*(Sneak peak: it is extremely detrimental, at least to me and the kind of women I associate with.)*

My other idea is to look for a correlation between religion and depression, because a common complaint I hear from people is that they're told the reason they're depressed is their distance from Allah. These people (my sister and others) have bounced around looking for any therapist with an actual medical opinion, but... you know.

astro_tempest,,2017-10-25 09:45:44,78mmtr,0,"I'm going to be starting my honours year in physics, and I have a psychiatric condition. 

It's very stable and I attend weekly sessions with a psychiatrist and psychologist. I haven't had a serious episode in about 5 years and they were rare even then. At my worst I can lose touch with reality somewhat, get mild hallucinations (""disturbances""), and generally zone out a bit. I can tell when things are beginning to deteriorate, and I'd usually have plenty of time to see a health professional or to take the medication that I have for those situations. Most times I'd be able to make small adjustments to my schedule to help me relax (even just walking outside) and nothing further is needed. Only at my absolute theoretical worst would I be unable to direct myself to medication, or unable to be trusted to do it correctly. At that point, I'd need help. I'm not violent in these conditions, rather catatonic. 

I have disability accommodations with the university but they only cover examination conditions and explicitly don't apply anywhere else. It's the university's policy that any other accommodations be organised between student and supervisor. Given that grad programs (and honours in particular) are very stressful, I think it'd be a good idea to give someone in the department the contact information for my psychiatrist, but I don't know who would be best. If confronted with a student who is exhibiting paranoia or lack of connection to reality, staff are supposed to consult the relevant mental health professional supplied if it's a condition that they're already aware of, and police otherwise. I'd like to avoid police. 

My supervisor is aware that I have mental health difficulties (but not specifics) and is very supportive, so I'd feel most comfortable giving the number to him. He'll also see me more often than any other staff member in the department. Giving the information to the secretary would make it more available to other people, but I don't know how she'd react to the information or the stigma I'd face if news got out. 

Any advice on how to go about this conversation with either? I want to make it very clear that it's a condition that I manage privately and that they're not expected to act as my counsellor or something, which I know is a concern some people have if someone admits to having (e.g.) depression. There are a lot of safety nets in place for me already and this is not a new condition. Giving them my psychiatrist's contact details isn't a sign that I think they're ever likely to need them either, it's just that *if* they ever need them, then by definition I'll be unable to supply. 

Thanks for any tips",AskAcademia,Who should I give emergency contact information to with regards to my mental health?
