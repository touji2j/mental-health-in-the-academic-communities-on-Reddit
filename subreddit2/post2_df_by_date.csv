I am pursuing a master's degree in computer science. I am in the second year and have to do my thesis, which is the only thing missing before i complete the programme.

As I write in the title, i am losing my motivation. Before I started the programme I was working as software engineer, and I quit in order to come back to academia because I had missed learning. The first year of my studies I was very motivated and energetic, planning to even go on for a PhD.

But now it seems that I am losing interrest. To the point that I devote very few hours per week on working on my thesis. Of course the whole covid situtation is not helping either. Have you had similar experiences in your academic career? Losing a lot of interrest in academics, especially in a period that was critical and would probably shape your next few years?

I understand that academia are associated with a bunch of mental health issues that could lead to experiences like mine, and I am trying to address these as best as I can. But I am asking you if you have practical advice on how to overcome them in the short term, since the next few months will be very important.

I tried to post this on offmychest but it was removed because of the link to COVID-19. I'm hoping for catharsis here but I doubt I'll get it since Reddit isn't the most forgiving place. Can I whine to y'all a bit?

I'm feeling super salty today. My anger and envy are disrupting my ability to work. I know need to be counting my blessings that I have my meager $22/hr job and health insurance and I really should just be a grown up and deal with my feelings to be considerate of the so many who have been laid off.

In spite of this, I am feeling so envious today that all of a sudden seemingly everyone in my life has all kinds of free time to exercise for 5 hours in the middle of the day and garden and/or just be a jag off. I have friends at the university right now who are being paid to do absolutely nothing and are living it up in the gorgeous weather we are having. 

Meanwhile, My own personal work is expounding but my pay and my hours will not. My boss is a classic top-of-the-totem-pole old school full professor at a huge R1 with enough power to frequently buy herself out of teaching which she has done this semester. I'm her research assistant and she's also my project supervisor. I'm DESPERATELY trying to just fucking write the last chapter of my already totally massive SEVEN CHAPTER quant/qual diss so I can graduate. 

Suddenly my duties are multiple because my boss can't see me working with her eyeballs and I think she's piling on the work and adding unrealistic deadlines just to ensure I stay busy. She's treating email like instant messenger and if I don't answer emails, she calls my personal cell phone.  I think it's just to try and control my behavior. I am at my computer from 8-7 and take a small break for dinner and go right back to the computer. The blurring of home/work is really wearing on me and it's only been a week. 

This blows so much ass. I haven't had time to work on my diss since we shifted to online work and I am starting to panic I'm not going to finish this semester. My supervisor ignores my diss related emails but is constantly sending work tasks. 

My partner is also defending his diss next week via zoom and is just happy as a pig in shit. He went on a 2 hour bike ride today while I put together charts and graphs and wrote a fucking lit review. I'm super supportive to him about his diss defense outwardly and have been this whole entire time, but inside I feel nothing but jealousy that he's free. 

I closed all the blinds and draperies and blocked out all the sunshine yesterday because I didn't want to see the gorgeous weather. My partner accused me of being mental and asked what the fuck was wrong with me. I just couldn't take seeing all the families and couples just out and about having fun and walking dogs and living actual life while I did yet another menial bullshit task that was cognitively intensive enough that I couldn't listen to a podcast or something while I worked but boring enough that staying focused was major challenge. 

I hate this, I really really hate this, and I am looking for catharsis. Do any of you feel the same way? How the hell am I going to make it through a few months of this? How the fuck can I walk the line with my professor?

After being a grad student and a postdoc for several years, I developed severe mental health issues (after being completely healthy in my youth, as far as I can tell).

My friends (around eight people who I knew well) who were graduate students or postdocs at the same time have experienced terrible mental health problems/breakdowns (such as bipolar disorder, psychosis, suicidal tendencies, needing to take a year off work, being placed into a mental hospital for some time, forgetting to eat).

Three other grad students I knew developed severe illnesses (unknown physical illnesses for two of them and an instance of extreme anxiety for the third one) that are not compatible with working and they have been unemployed since then.

A professor and another postdoc I met can only function when they are taking heavy doses of antidepressants (the professor in fact tends to experience prolonged periods of time when he is not able to function at all). As far as I know, all these people developed their mental health problems after being in academia for some time. In addition to these, I have heard many more people in academia talking non-specifically about often going through periods of depression, which is frequently accompanied by inability to work.

I am wondering what can be done to improve this situation.

Should there be more research into mental health in academia, especially among grad students and postdocs?

Should there be more preventative measures that can ensure better coping of junior academics with mental health difficulties that are likely to befall them?

PI accused me of not showing enough passion for science and letting them down for not being in lab during a freaking weekend, though it was after weeks of 60+hr work. It was pretty bad considering I went into lab at 4am to finish the work. I considered transferring labs then. People did warn me PIs don't change. But there were more open conversations about depression and overworking. So I stayed since I liked the research I was doing. 

Now, I kind of regret it. Since labs are reopening under restrictions, my lab has been trying to get everyone in lab to work 5-7 days a week. My lab never truly shut down, and was operating at 40% during lockdown. Now we are at 90% with working shifts and weekends even though my state still gets 200+ covid19 cases per day and masks are recommending but not mandatory.

I feel like he is forgetting that leaving his house and commuting to work everyday increases risk of exposure.

I needed some help with an academic petition I am filing which involves failed grades from my transcript. I just wanted to know if this is convincing enough. Any suggestions/comments would be helpful. As a context LWD means withdrawing from a course after dropout date has passed.


To the petitions committee at the University of xxxxx,

I am writing in the hope to remove/lwd from courses I took in the 2018-2019 school year; specifically MAT1xxY1, MAT2xxH1F &amp; Cxx1xxH1F. I acknowledge that after speaking with Academic Councillors, Social Workers &amp; Mathematical &amp; Computational Science adminstration LWDs are only granted before a student writes their final exam. However, due to impending severe mental health issues, internal family conflicts I was not in the correct state of mind to make a judgement call regarding my actions. My intention for this LWD is to address the fact that these grades from the 2018-2019 school year do not reflect my academic capabilities, and as such are impacting my CGPA and entry into the Applied Statistics Major. 

It's been a year since I filed my petition to lift my academic suspension where I mentioned the root cause of my downfall. I was facing depression, anxiety, insomnia as well as some sort of attention disorder problems since late winter (October) 2018. For the 2017-2019 academic years, I was living with my mother who has a severe form of paranoid schizophrenia. In addition to having to handle her other paranoid delusions, my mother frequently behaved the past academic year in a way that was detrimental to my learning and my ability to perform successfully in my courses, such as restricting my ability to attend evening lectures and confiscating my electronics, including my laptop on which I complete all of my assignments. The stress of having to live with and manage these behaviors caused my own mental health to suffer, and despite my best efforts, my performance in my classes was negatively affected. To be very specific being lost in thought for hours (remaining frozen/paralyzed), having sucidal thoughts, crying relentless for no given reason, battling insomnia due to lack of sleep (2 hours or less), etc. I tried to reach out to CAMH multiple times however, the sheer ignorance and lack of understanding about mental health and the stigma revolving around it bested me. My peers discouraged me from seeking help based on the fear of being arrested for having suicidal thoughts and that stuck with me for a long time. I was torn between moving out, making my academic life a priority and taking care of my mother. As a result, my mental health was severely affected and I was afraid of getting help from xxxx, CAMH or any of the department councillors. I didn't know what to do so I continued on with my courses regardless of knowing the circumstances up ahead. I was also under the impression that LWDs affect your GPA (according to my peers) and thats why I decided to continue taking my courses including my exam. If I had asked for help from Academic Councillors and talked about LWDs I would have used this option and not waste all of my credit no credits. 

Since January of 2019, I moved out and started subletting from friends in downtown Toronto. Like I mentioned earlier, I was so afraid of making mistakes in MAT1xx and Cxx1xx (requirements for Computer Science) that I would waste time on tests and exams by second guessing myself on simple questions rather than moving along confidently. I did decent in STA1xx despite this fact as the course had a lot of assignments, group discussions and topics that interested me. I was doing well in the course including the programming assignments and I had found a new interest in Statistics which carried on to some of my philosophy courses I picked such as PHL3xx and PHL3xx. I want to pursue statistics as I like my courses and I enjoy them, however because of my slip up in 2018-2019 school year, my CGPA is preventing me from enrolling in the major program as the requirements keep going up each year. I want to LWD/remove my failed courses in 2018-2019 as they don't reflect my academic capabilities. I have managed to bring up my GPA in philosophy courses that are Math/Stats/proof heavy and I really don't want to major in the humanities or any other program. I want to pursue this major and continue excelling in my academics and the only way to do is by removing my failed grades from the transcript.",academia,Need help with academic petition

My dissertation has just been approved and I can not be more relieved. I am not relieved because of impostor syndrome or because the work load was too high. I am relieved that I never have to meaningfully interact with my advisor again unless I decide to. I can go into industry, and none of my future success requires further actions or approval from my advisor who is so prone to inaction and the inability to effectively communicate.

I am in a highly theoretical STEM field, where the individual research interests of professors are so distinct it is difficult to get good guidance from other committee members. Additionally, the barrier to entry is quite high and it is not common to complete publications in this field without heavy guidance.

During my PhD studies, I developed severe anxiety regarding meeting deadlines and the ability to control my own success. It was very frequent that meetings would be canceled at the last moment. My advisor was full of excuses, and as legitimate as they may be, did not offer sincere apologies. There are long periods where I make attempts for communication, by email, messaging, and phone call, with little or no response. There are empty promises of reading my work or doing a small task by a certain date, which are not met and when not met not addressed with an apology or request for more time, but rather a slew of excuses of being laden with administrative and personal affairs.

I have had many mental breakdowns during my PhD. These stem from politely pushing him to take action, and repeatedly being ignored or given false promises of completing said action. The inability for my polite actions to result in him taking necessary action for my success is the root of these breakdowns and anxiety. At times I have shared these ailments with my advisor, however this hasn't changed his behavior, perhaps superficially for a short amount of time, but the pattern reemerges shortly after.

I am free now, but it is my true belief that inaction and inability to effectively communicate, especially when aware of a student's declining mental health, is abusive. This realization was gradual, I perhaps only realized I felt this way 4 years in. I did not speak out because I was afraid that it would waste my years of work. Once I have degree in hand, I will no longer afraid of speaking out (I am not afraid of not having his reference, I am not confident in his ability to write a good reference in a timely manner, and I have other references.). I have talked to other students in my research group, and we all share some notion of this decline in mental health. I want my actions to help them, and I understand that these feelings may not be completely localized to this one advisor and may be a more common phenomena in academia.

I do not want to defame. My feeling is my advisor is experiencing mental health decline himself. I do think that professors, as people of power, have the responsibility to be good advisors and not directly cause mental health decline. I want to reach out to the department, but I do not know how to effectively incite change. I do not want to complain. I want to create change. First I want to create change for my former peers who are suffering the inaction of my advisor. If successful, a general method is preferred that can be applied in various departments. I want to start by inciting reform to increase the accountability of problem professors to communicate regularly and allow students to control their success to a larger degree.

I have thought about writing letters to the department chair and graduate student general advisor, and I think that is the first step. I was wondering if any of you have suggestions, or have had success creating localized reform within a department before. This will certainly not be easy, however your suggestions are very much appreciated.",academia,"Advisor inaction, non-communication, and irresponsibility: what department level accountability standards can be developed for improving student/advisor relations with problem advisors"

The issue is I'm struggling to begin my dissertation which is a literature review. I've already used 2 extensions (6 months each) due to my mental health, and I've only written 1000 words (out of 15000). Whenever I think about my upcoming deadline next month or sit down to start, I either have a panic attack or become overwhelmed and depressed.  

I've tried looking at guides on how to complete a lit review to dissertation standards - but I just can't get it into my head to even make a plan.  

I've been in touch with my lecturer about my issues, but after 15-16 months of having the dissertation assigned and I've only done 1000 words, there's only so much I'm willing to say. I'm also waiting to see a psychiatrist for my mental health.

I am in my eighth year of teaching. I am a NBCT and hold a Master’s degree in educational leadership. I am of the generation that is comfortable with educational technology. In my undergrad program, I even had a semester-long course on teaching with technology. Yet here we are, six months into a devastating pandemic and I still feel like I’m reinventing the wheel. I have all of the tools and training one would think is necessary to make the pivot to distance learning seamless. So why is it that I am sleeping less, working more, and getting less than desired results?

Parents tell us everything that is on their minds  but it feels like I’m chasing the unattainable. I require too much and not enough at the same time. I’m too strict and too forgiving. My curriculum is simultaneously rigorous and easy. I can’t make everyone happy and they aren’t afraid to communicate their displeasure with how I do my job. 

Our administrators and OSPI tells us we need to consider the mental health of our students and be as forgiving as possible. Our motto is “do no harm,” and yet no one is talking openly about what this is doing to teachers. Why doesn’t that motto extend to those who are in the trenches, doing the hard work that you’re asking us to carry out? We have directives and initiatives but we are the ones receiving harsh parent emails. As a professional, I should not be degraded by parents who have no problem critiquing my abilities or personality. 

Our community members host rallies and protest. They claim they are concerned about the long term effects that school closures will have on children, but they’re not taking in the full issue. What about the long term effects of attending the funerals of your friends and teachers? These people claim to use their professional expertise to know what is best in this pandemic but as I see it, unless you are an epidemiologist or a public health professional with a speciality in disease transmission, you do not have a leg to stand on. I am a highly trained teacher but I don’t claim to have the same skill set as a law professor. Just because we’re in similar fields does not mean we have the same experience and expertise. 

I am afraid to speak up. I am afraid to tell coworkers that I don’t trust them. I am afraid to say that I do not feel comfortable returning to the classroom until there is a vaccine AND students and staff have been vaccinated. I am already very aware of the fact that I don’t fit in with the ideology of the community I teach in, nor would I change that. My values come from my personal experiences just as much as anyone else’s. However, the way we talk about COVID has spiraled into something so intense and so negative that you will be berated for “buying into” public health considerations. 

We are forcing teachers to choose between their vocation and their health. It shouldn’t be that simple. Ask anyone who knows me and they will tell you that teaching is who I am. My profession is my identity. I take pride in what I do every step of the way. I miss my classroom that I have spent years building into a warm, welcoming, safe place for students. I miss my students and the joy they bring into class each day. I hate staring at screens all day but you know what I would hate more? Not getting to see each and every one of my students graduate because they didn’t survive. Not being able to have the honor of writing college letters of recommendation or being a job application reference. I shouldn’t have to attend the funerals of my students instead of their graduation celebrations. 

There’s too much at stake to say that we just need to reopen schools. It’s not that simple. There is so much that is out of our control right now, so why aren’t we focusing on what we can do? Why is it a political issue instead of just being the right thing? Since when is kindness and compassion for the potential suffering of others not worth being uncomfortable temporarily? Instead of complaining, we need to make a dramatic shift of our focus as teachers or parents. School is a place. Education is still happening. We can take away the pressures and problems of the education system now. Parents need to be more actively involved in their children’s education. That isn’t the fault of teachers. That is how it should have been all along. 

No one else will speak for me. I did not ask you to speak on my behalf. I see where you are coming from. At the same time, I am holding fast to my belief that this pandemic will not improve until every single person views prevention measures like wearing a mask properly and social distancing as their responsibility and duty to themself and others. Do not dismiss this as part of the liberal agenda; it isn’t. Do not buy into the false belief that a building opening is more important than public health. Just because someone screams loudly on a Facebook video does not make them right.",academia,Letter to the editor:

Preface: This is just my experience, I am in no way speaking on the state of History education as a whole, again this is just my experience. 

I came to college with the goal of studying Mechanical Engineering while also broadening my horizons, as I have interests in Philosophy and History. I know many people like to shit on a liberal arts education and understandably so -Colleges (especially the one I currently attend) seem to use this idea to justify making students spend large amounts of money on classes that are plain terrible. One example would be the required UNV 101 class that is essentially a History of the University / Diversity Training class, taught by a prof who had no motivation- but I had a relatively naive idea that I could go to University and come out not just an engineer, but a renaissance man with knowledge in a variety of subjects. One way I choose to make this more of a reality was to take a history minor. I was especially looking forward to the discussion sections where students debate interpretations of historical documents.

While I always knew that academia was left-leaning, I was not ready for the white guilt guillotine in every single history class, and its damaging to both intellectual discourse and -as much as I wouldn't like to admit it- mental health. I come in to my History of Both World Wars class, and instead of lecturing about the wars themselves, I'm subjected to an hour and a half long lecture -every class- on how the wars and countries involved negatively affected different ethnic minorities around the world. Now, its not that I'm against learning about minority perspectives, in fact I think it's super interesting to learn about the wide reach of these wars and the lesser known stories of how it affected people. But in a class branded as History of Both World Wars, It was frustrating to A) not dive into much detail about the world wars themselves and B) Learn about the entire world war era thought the lens of tyranny and imperial subjugation, when it seems there are many more economic and social issues to consider as well. The discussion sections were even worse. I had hoped that this would be a time to engage in debate and hear out other perspectives. Instead I sat though an hour long echo chamber in which any differing interpretation was shut down and sometimes punished with poor discussion grades. I very quickly learned that the way to success was to parrot the professor, get the A, and GTFO.

After taking three different history classes, each being very similar in political bias, I finally gave up on the History Department. I understand the want to express historically underrepresented perspectives, but the pendulum has swung a little too far for my liking. I recently changed my minor to mathematics as it's pretty difficult to segue from multi-variable calculus to racial injustice.

This is a sentiment I often hear among other engineering majors. They wish to move away from the uber-technical classes of engineering and broaden their horizons, but end up coming right back because the bull shit levels in other classes are too high. I read a decent amount on my own, so I don't feel like I'm missing out on the content, but I do wish I could have the experience of a legit civil debate in my classes.",academia,I was told to post this here.

Looking for some advice on how to be as efficient as possible. I am in a 3-""ish"" year phd program. We are funded for three years with optional fourth year funding. I am an RA on a 5-year grant, so I expected to have two more years of funding after this year. My advisor is not pleased with my lack of productivity since C-19. We are in the US, I have a small child, and I am high risk so my toddler cannot attend daycare. 

I told my PI that an optional, extra research project they asked me to be on was becoming much more than I expected because it was more than they described (i.e., ""you will have third authorship in exchange for data collection"" was actually doing all of the pre-data collection prep, data collection, data cleaning, participant interaction, etc. including hashing out study ideas). 

My PI then said that if I am going to turn down research opportunities, I need to graduate in May so a first-year student can be recruited and given my RA position for two years. I have not even started my dissertation (three-paper option). My PI did not know that I needed 12 credits for dissertation so she gave me less than one week to complete my second qualifying paper (which was barely drafted), then switched some of my credits this semester to dissertation credits. 

This is all fine because the world is a mess anyways. I can't go get a job because my son is home and working remotely clearly isn't as productive as it should be. My question is really...

how do I get this done?! 

I want to create a very detailed timeline so I don't miss anything. I will have 3, sometimes 4, working days per week. For mental health purposes, I need to go be active one of my days where I am not parenting.

It's fufilling or meaningful to me, but the culture surrounding academia has left me bitter and in despair. For example in the past I've experienced academic bullying and was gaslit about it. This doesn't seem to be a unique situation in my field. There were prominent new stories about similar occurences everywhere, and the perpetrators never faced any sorts of consequences whatsoever. The response by universities tends to be beaucratic, top-down, and protects the institute, the few professors at the top, and does not genuinely care about its students despite the incessant and somewhat for-show HR-managed awareness campaigns centred over frivolous morning teas and wellness seminars run by admin. Actual academic faculty don't often participate in or barely manage to conceal their impatience for these things. Even mentioning one's personal or emotional life, burnout or mental health is still seen as a weakness or moral failing and professionally taboo by many senior staff members. Students are often isolated and unsupported, and raising any issues even with research as students leaves you very vulnerable. At this stage with a student and their advisor is a enormous power imbalance, especially in my field due to its less collaborative structure. This seems fundamentally unjust. My current institute seems less dyfunctional than others I've been at, but postdocs I've talked to still see it as a huge issue compared to the rare (in their opinion) 'better-run' universities and have tried to advocate for change for some years but according to them it's a losing battle as it falls on deaf ears. These people often seem happy to leave academia and look for positions in industry, but I know there are other people like me who want to make it work but don't know how. How can we be expected to do amazing research when this is the context for our work?

I don’t know whether this is too broad etc, or even right at all. Ps, I’ve tried researching this topic, some journals come up about nurse experiences etc but not many, leading me to wonder if I should really change my title.

tired_RA,t2_85hm4tkw,2020-09-22 03:28:00,ixfqyy,1,"I'm not a grad student but I hoped this would resonate with other students. I'm currently working in a (dry) lab as a research assistant on a project.

**The ""conflict"" that lead to the meeting:**

I recently asked my supervisor whether I could use the data I was collecting for the project. The project had specific outcomes that needed to be delivered and I thought of an interesting idea outside of that and wanted to see if I could run with it. She told me that the data was not hers but the grant providers so I could not. She also would often mention using the data for her PhD project that she was trying to do part-time. Here's where I was confused and felt uncomfortable with. I was totally on board with contributing my ideas, thoughts and methodology design ideas for the project but I felt uncomfortable if it were to do with her PhD. I don't know what the rules or ethics are and I didn't want to overstep that boundary so I also asked for her to clear that up. She just told me that she got special permission from the grant provider to utilize the data for her project. Okay... that didn't really clear it up but I just told her that I would have appreciated being told at the beginning of the project so I knew where my role stood. I thought I could also contribute to the project in different ways but now I clearly knew that this was her project and for me to just help collect data.

That's when she got really upset. I really don't know why. In my opinion and from my perspective, at least I asked for clarification before going about doing my own thing. I had misunderstood my role and she cleared that up for me. However, she was upset and started saying how I hurt her by asking such a question, blaming her, and that after all she did for me she would have expected my gratitude and appreciation and that I was not showing it. I apologized, although I did not mean it, as I realized she tried to guilt trip me by talking about my coworker needing money for their children's education and how she worked so hard to get the funding to cover their pay.

**The meeting:**

So to make a long story short, two weeks later she calls me into a meeting with an assistant professor. We sat down and the conversation begins where she tells her side of the story. From her perspective I blamed her for not telling me information about the project. I acknowledged her feeling of hurt and said it was not my intention and that I was extremely sorry for what I did. Then the conversation turns into how amazing my supervisor is, providing funding for our team, getting grants, being so knowledgeable, taking care of everyone, how she was my mentor (self-proclaimed) and taking turns to say how much of a terrible person I was to not appreciate her and this opportunity I had at this lab and how I should not be trying to steal her data. How I should know my place as a research assistant and just collect data. Don't be over ambitious. Flatter people. Be more social and don't tarnish relationships. Other labs are a more abusive to their research staff, don't you know how lucky you are to be here, to have an amazing supervisor like her? She also said ""I don't care if you've had a bad childhood or bad whatever. You really need to fix how you treat other people."" To add insult to injury, while I was trying to convey my perspective and was trying to say that yes, I agree that I'm not great at verbalizing my thoughts, my supervisor interrupts me to say ""Yeah, I noticed. You never say sorry or thank you."".

What really upsets me is that this assistant professor only heard her side of the story, didn't bother to talk to me and basically ganged up on me together with my supervisor. I don't know why they made it so personal and attacked me personally. Had they told me that my behaviour was unacceptable and unprofessional then I would have been fine. I'm also shocked at how transactional everything is to her. I do this for you so you must be compliant. Don't complain or ask questions.

I really want to escape. My mental health has taken a nosedive. I feel worse than I have in a long time and am doing horrible things to myself that I don't want to talk about but you get the idea. I think I'll have to suck it up for another few months until I get the scholarship I need to go to grad school. I can't believe that there are people like this and people who support them. Thankfully I've recorded the whole conversation and will probably write up a transcript for safe keeping.",academia,I had a meeting with my supervisor and an assistant professor where they took turns degrading my character and talking about how amazing my supervisor is.

I’ll be graduating next sem and so I have to start thinking about whether I should do masters or not. My major is electrical engineering. I’m currently not in the mood of doing masters mainly cuz I am under the impression that having a masters degree doesn’t really matter in the real world and it just takes two years of your life. Also I’m the eldest son in the family and so I’m starting to feel this sense of responsibility such as getting a job and providing for my family cuz my dad might lose or retire from his job. I’m from a middle class family and I’m pretty sure we won’t last long if my dad doesn’t have a job. Also one of my younger bro’s will be starting college soon and so that’s gonna be expensive. Another reason is that I have a Bad impression of thesis based masters. I’m an undergraduate researcher at my uni and my research experience so far (around one year) hasn’t been the best and it’s mainly cuz my advisor treats me like shit and assumes that Ik everything, so yea I’ve had a pretty rough time with research. But some my friends tell me that this experience shouldn’t be a deciding factor. Anyhow I’ll have a few publications by the time i graduate. I’m a scholarship student at a university well known for its research and so since I don’t have enough money to pay for masters, I might end up doing  research based masters in my current uni (it’s free of charge) or I might end up going to another uni (also free charge) which is also known for its research. So really my only option is to go for a research based masters. In this sub I haven’t really come across anyone who’s had a good experience with research and I understand cuz I’ve had the same bs experience over the past one year. I actually just want this year to end so that my grant comes to an end. I seriously need a break from research as it has affected both my mental health and my grades. I’m not a smart student who can manage everything but I can work hard if something has to be done. So I have been working my ass off to manage both my research work and school work. I have been saving some money but I’m pretty sure it’s not enough to even pay one semester of college tuition. I also intend to use this money for my brother fees and i feel like it’s the right thing to do. So basically there are a lot of factors that will determine my decision.

Exact_Hall3915,t2_3t97x2cd,2020-10-27 21:57:49,jjaxh6,1,"TL;DR: Was RA during undergrad in multiple labs. Mental illness/breakdown led to leaving. 
Returned this year. Embarrassed to interact with the department. What are my options? 

My undergrad was ok; in second year I managed to do independent studies and present at some conferences. Unfortunately, there was a falling out with a professor. I’d requested help with poster pick-up (which was dumb). I didn’t think it was much of a problem as she regularly told me to email her if I needed help or something. This was one request I’d made but most of the work was done by myself and a grad student. She was very busy so I tried to work as independently as possible throughout the semester so in my mind the request wasn’t a boundary violation. I received a scathing email from my professor indicating that my request was ridiculous/she’d have never done that as an undergrad. It sent me into a full day panic. To top it all off my computer program didn’t show me all of her poster edit suggestions so I received another scathing email. I bailed on a conference in the US after that. Things were tense and relationships declined. 

My mental health declined too (thanks to a series of unrelated unfortunate events) and I left the university. I was supposed to help co-author a paper (in a different lab) when my mental health tanked again to the point of psychosis. My supervisors and lab group were likely extremely disappointed and upset. No one knew what was happening (not even me). I tried my best but a) I might be too stupid to navigate academia and b) too mentally ill. 

Fast forward to the present: I’ve returned to finish my degree. Unfortunately I’m way too embarrassed to even interact with any faculty in the department. 

Do I have options? I have some work I’m credited for but no published work as an author and sadly no LoRs. I was so close to being set for grad school. Now I’m starting over much later. I’m concerned that my mental health issues are a sign I shouldn’t pursue anything beyond this B.Sc.",academia,Returning after messy history?

I had an academic tenured career in my home country, I got masters,  and promoted assistant lecturer at this at the time at my home country I lost my Mom, and Grandmother, I got sick, it was a dark time moreover, I did not enjoy the politics at my university, although students liked me so much and still even still ask me for recommendation letters. I will complete 30 in a few weeks, and it is shame to feel lost. I took the decision to leave everything behind since I developed C-PTSD, but I did not know when I travelled, I was in a bad mental health situation while doing the PhD (for maybe returning back to be a lecturer in my home country, however, I don't think that something I can even go to the place I had the worst memories).

Long story short, I did not get along with the supervisors I had, I had to move to another and another one, all of the choices were wrong, and maybe I wasn't lucky enough and I took decision out desparations.

However, I feel everything happen in our life of reason, I started a side-hustle since two years ago and unexpectedly made a success and I can call it now my passion and true call, however, I don't bring me money to leave the day job in academia.

This is side hustle boosted my mental health, confidence, while moving from program to another one for sake of better environment, I started to face bullying, complete ignorance, and isolation from the group, gaslighting, and few incidents and I even went to the ombudsman, she didnot help, the region is quite xenophobic although they seemed to be nice at the beginning (at the beginning).

Thanks to the side-hustle I have made a good network, I considered moving to something to my location, but there no funding to leave to another one and one of the struggle I will complete 30 (I am still single, but it is exhausting to move again at this age)

Honestly, I feel pain not because the work itself change, the environment is demoralizing to the extent I cannot describe but it makes me low energy because of this environment, I had threats against the side-hustle and clearly they did not like that I got attention in our field because of that side-hustle.

I am trying to make this side-hustle as profession but super challenging because there isno income and everyone in this side-hustle take years or maybe if I am lucky I can make it happen I dont know.

I love science, I was always top student, I had a career and now I feel I am in the middle of the now where I cannot return to my home country (I had nightmares and I cannot describe how this place hurted me so much) and here I feel lost.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried therapy for C-PTSD but it takes time, and I feel happy when I am doing that scientific side-hustle, and some thoughts tell me you have to be ashamed at the age losing what you have been doing at early twenties. I am crying, I hope you can understand me and give me advices whether I am doomed, I am just cannot push it harder.",academia,I feel lost!

I just successfully defended my dissertation at the #1 program in my field, and I trust everyone involved far less than I did when they pulled me in. I’m not even sure I’ll be heading in an academic direction at this point, even with the degree under my belt. My mental health is certainly far worse than it was when I entered the program, and my mentors somehow consider me a “success.”

Make your advisor earn your trust and push them away if that trust is broken. Only trust her or him for specific issues related to getting you to where you want to be. As a grad student, you work for your advisor and any good work you do reflects positively on that person. Your advisor will probably want you to do things that make them look great and do nothing for you.

Be really, really careful about this. Even if your advisor acts like your friend, you still have to be careful. They may steal your work, they may promise things they never deliver on, they may ignore your emails. Look out for yourself. Period.",academia,Trust No One Fully

goldspotzingthing,t2_679eazh4,2020-12-02 19:53:02,k5gvty,1,"I am a non-resident alien (H1B) based in the US working for a state university. I was on FMLA leave this semester (Fall 2020) and have applied for state disability insurance for an extension of my disability leave for the Spring semester too. I had to do this some years earlier albeit at that time my FMLA leave was in Spring and the state disability extended into the summer when no classes are held. That meant that effectively I was not able to teach only for one semester. My department head was extremely supportive and there were no problems at any stage of the process.

This time round though, there is a new department head who has been extremely hostile to me ever since they joined. While my FMLA went through for this Fall, it has now ended. I am currently awaiting the decision on my state disability insurance and there is every chance that they won't arrive at a decision by early Jan 2021 when school reopens. I want to take a Leave of Absence starting immediately or starting Jan 2021 without waiting for the state disability decision to arrive because I am medically not fit to resume my job. Here's what I want to know:

1. Can the university refuse the Leave of Absence even though my doctors have provided medical documents supporting the need to extend my leave?
2. How much clout does the department head have in this case? Do they have the  power to not approve or sign on any application for a Leave of Absence? Honestly, I have no faith in them or their support. I sent all my disability papers to HR and feel extremely uncomfortable to share any personal medical details with the department head. I assume that that information should be protected by HIPPA and they are outside their rights to press me on medical details. 
3. Is it possible to be on state disability while also on Leave of Absence? In other words, am I ineligible for state disability insurance money if I am on a Leave of Absence?
4. Is disability a valid reason to take a Leave of Absence?
5. I have contacted HR and they said they will consult their lawyers. Their lawyer has called and left a message on my phone. I don't have a personal lawyer and am not in a position healthwise to hunt a good lawyer for myself in such little time. Moreover, I live in a small obscure town and the major law firm works for the university. I also don't have anyone who can do all the running around and search for a lawyer on my behalf. I want to know what my rights are before I return the university's lawyer's call. Can I take a Leave of Absence and then see what happens with the state disability insurance? Can they fire me? In the past they hadn't but the boss was different.

As one can imagine, this is an extremely stressful situation for me. My family is based abroad and I need this job until I can find another one. Due to covid I am also unable to travel back to my country where the infection rates are exponentially rising. Such a situation is neither good for my mind nor health.

I used to stand down and apologise quickly because that was my first reaction to confrontation. My head is now clear, the facts and proof have been gathered. Maybe this has hurt my career advances within academia but seeing how academia works, I frankly don't really want to pursue it.

I did the work - the idea, the design, the data collection, the analysis. You want me to spoon-feed you how to do it. I spent hours going out of my way to make it easier for you to understand how to do it yet tou ignored my emails and my requests to follow through with certain tasks. When I finally spoke up and said I would like to have the first author because of my substantive contribution, your first rebuttal was that you need to have it for your PhD. That's not a valid reason. I stated the research ethics guideline and the only contributions you could attribute to for this were funding acquisition and administrative tasks. That's not enough. No, my ethical standards aren't ""too high"". I didn't even use the funding you got to do the research. It was all data that could be collected through the library resources.

I'm bringing this issue to my PI who also happens to be the head of the department. I'm sick and done with your constant harassment, threats, and how you go off on a tangent of how much you've done for the team.

Thank you and sorry for the rant!

Edit:

Talked to my PI. I wasn't able to fully detail the problem and situation because I was so flustered.  I explained how we were having authorship disputes and that I asked for first authorship because I had done the entirety of the work. The ultimate advice I got was 'don't try to burn bridges and relationships' and 'seniority matters'. I feel defeated and just used. I'm also in my early career stages. Is it because I'm not doing a PhD that I am less important, less in need or have less say than someone who is and older than I am? 

The bridge has already been burnt. There's no turning back. The passive-aggressive comments and nitpicking every aspect of my flaw in my personality... is that what I have to endure because of seniority?

My(now deleted) long post on StackExchange from March of last year. Detailing a lot of garbage from our Math department; it's hard to get across the context in which these comments were made, and a couple of these could be deemed somewhat inoffensive here, but mostly the environment was such that even the couple of seemingly mild incidents mentioned here seemed extremely serious, compared to another PhD environment I had been in till 2016. Frankly, looking back, I wrote this in a very measured tone. The biggest trigger initially for me to want to make these things public was the constant frothing at the mouth ultra demeaning way in which a specific PhD student behaved with me from the very beginning(as mentioned later), and later began the same with other international students(who also felt worked up with far less interaction with him than me). However, a lot of further incidents kept happening even after thisna initial impulse to make things public.

The incidents from 2019 and earlier this year would all have been dealt with a lot better if the present head of the department didn't become seriously sick, and he remained the head of the department from earlier on. Another recently graduated student wrote to me on Messenger that ""The department is going to become even more racist if he is not here now"".

&amp;#x200B;

This behavior is mostly from Spring 2018 and then Fall 2019. These raised extremely serious safety concerns at that time, and an office to address this behavior did not even exist inside this university until 2019. When I did finally report this to the new office, they said they take it seriously, but then completely dismissed everything mentioned here. Prior to that the only place to report this was their HR department, and I faced a further round of harassment from them, upon reporting the Spring 2018 events. I'm an Indian PhD student.

Let's call the concerned person X. The chair is called Chair.

In Spring 2018 I was teaching a Calculus class and X was then the so called supervisor in these teaching matters; at one point I was grading undergrad exams in his office. On his office door is a newsclip of the professor who was viewed as a terrorist for doing math on the plane. The newsclip ended in self-reflection, concluding that the only thing 'we' fear more than immigrants is Math.

While grading, at one point X casually remarked that he was looking for his boarding pass. I casually remarked we should all be careful doing Math on a plane; when he very proudly told me 'no, I'm white'. I replied; 'well wasn't the guy in that incident also white'? then he smugly said as a putdown, 'yes, but he was Italian, I'm not Italian, I'll be fine’. There was another visiting postdoc well within earshot in the room with his back turned to us, as this was happening.

A few days later, I had been late for a few hours in finishing grading; something that literally always people are, including X (I also wasn't very pleased when on the prior evening, my advisor from back then needlessly insulted me in front of several other faculty members for coming to a dinner with a colloquium speaker, when I had no intention to really go there but for the fact that I thought he would expect me to be there). While no one else had an issue, one of X's minions, a fellow PhD student, came to my office and told me it's disgusting I was late and that he was shaking in anger as a result. I told him politely to leave and shut the door of my office. Upon hearing this, X came to my office seeming extremely bellicose, physically intimidated me and forced himself into my office, as if I was a criminal. I told him also to please get out of my office , after which he got out and went to chair's office and started complaining about me. No one was inconvenienced then because I was late for a few hours with grading, and every single time I have graded with people, one or more people have been late with grading.

After a midterm exam, X was asking opinions about how to grade a contentious question; one of his minions passionately said something to which X replied in a conciliatory tone ""I know you're from U Chicago and you think you know best, but I disagree""; I was right there and also tried getting a word in, and X looked at me with absolute detestation, suggesting you don't have a right to say anything here.

Earlier that day, I was hearing him talking down to a Chinese graduate student, telling him there's an American PhD student also in the room he would be invigilating in for the exam, and that student would take care of everything, and the Chinese student doesn't need to know any of the procedures for setting up the exam in the exam room.

During the proctoring, we had to add up some numbers for some reason and I was doing it in my head; X's minion was standing there and suddenly he lost it; started saying 'it's disgusting you guys can add stuff up so fast'; talking about some racist tropes he has in his head about Indians. This was said in a really loud and unpleasant tone. X was right there and heard everything but said nothing.

Afterwards as we were grading in the lounge, as a lot of people were joking around I facetiously remarked that I might comment in an Indian student's exam in an Indian language; which of course I was not going to do. X got triggered and became serious and cooked up a story of some Chinese students and postdocs talking in Chinese in the corridors that apparently made so many people suspicious that there were serious complaints. This was said in a room full of graduate students, many of them Chinese, who interact in Chinese between themselves and with other Chinese faculty or postdocs and no one that I knew of found anything wrong in it. At another time, he told me in our lounge when others were present, that our university might be a nice place, but there is a Jewish clique, and then there is a Chinese clique and the whole environment is very divided. At another time, in our graduate lounge with a lot of people present, when I was casually remarking, after many such casual remarks by American students there, that the traffic here in Boston reminds me of India sometimes, X snapped and very threateningly told me: don’t B-S me, I’ve seen so and so movie, I know what traffic in India is like. Although the “very threatening” bit was so commonplace that it kind of feels strange to point that out.

As is the norm, X would ask for questions from graduate student instructors, in order to make the final list of exam questions. Not a single one of my questions were used in the two midterms, although a couple were used in the final exam if I recall. I found it unacceptable that none of these questions had been used in the midterms; I know of at least one other Indian phd student whose questions had not been used either, and he was OK with it; but I was not, with the amount of time spent in making the questions.

Surprisingly X once suddenly forced himself into my office last Fall, upon hearing some complaint from a recently graduated student about such issues, probably something about my general countenance struck a chord with him and compelled him to rush in to check if there was more pent up trouble further down the road, and I politely tried ending the conversation, because it was not productive. He concluded in solidarity, saying how he too was very wary when he first came here as a PhD student, since he was scared he would have to learn Hebrew, because of a large Jewish population here.

I've lost count of how many times one PhD student that Xhangs out with has said outrageous things in front of me, often directed at me; repeatedly saying how 'there are some typical Indians around here', that 'Indians are taking over' (even though there have only been 3 or 4 Indian students at a time in our program, and for the last 4 years there have been no Indian PhD students here) and how 'it's so funny there is great color consciousness in India since you guys are all brown'. Often these things were said in front of many other people, and if I counted individual instances, probably such comments were uttered a few dozen times in my presence. At one other time, in front of me and another Indian student who had mentioned that the Supreme Court judges in India are not known expressly as liberal and conservative partisans as is the case in the US, this student began to openly say in a disparaging tone that the judges in India would be no good anyway, in comparison to the US.

In the very beginning, in front of several other graduate students, he would be talking about a specific slur against Jews, that I didn’t know about earlier, in the tone that he was just curious about it but not using it himself, but kept using it repeatedly in front of several people. There was no Jewish person present when he kept on saying this.

At first I didn't think much of it, and even thought some of his comments about Indians was intended to be amusing which I shouldn't have; but upon talking with him a little more it was clear he was saying all these things not as a joke but meant everything. The worst situation was last Fall when during a mandatory meeting a couple of PhD students including me brought up some issues regarding transportation and mental health issues among undergrads, and after it ended, this PhD student in front of everyone else began to loudly say 'how funny it is how he always complains, it was so funny' and then came to my office and still kept insulting me to my face, ignoring the fact that there was another American PhD student who was raising far more issues than me .

There's also another PhD student X hangs out with all the time, who would froth at the mouth in my presence in the beginning, and in the presence of a few other international students; and probably it was the worst and most prolonged dehumanizing behavior I've faced from anyone younger than me, with him talking with me (and also a few other international PhD students a bit later) in a vile and threatening manner like we are lepers; however this person was careful not to utter slurs. I’ve spoken to a couple of other international students and they have also felt unnerved by him for prolonged periods, but I should emphasize this began the earliest with me and he was in the same year as me. Regarding him, I was speaking with another international PhD student, who told me that if someone behaved like that in his home country with him, he would punch him in the face. And this international student had to interact with him far far less than I had to. If it was in my own country, I would probably not punch him, but call the Police dozens of times.

This student became a favorite of one of our teaching coordinators, this teaching coordinator is someone we had no option to avoid and who would harass some of us on the simplest of pretexts. Another Indian PhD student remarked in front of me and someone else, that “the treatment of international students by this teaching coordinator is extremely poor”. I happened to mention this to another Indian PhD student here who was seriously harassed by this teaching coordinator and who had been documenting that harassment. Then the former Indian PhD student came to know about it, and sensing he might get into unnecessary trouble with this being added to the pantheon of comments and complaints, began to aggressively say “I never said such a thing”. Another international PhD student who graduated and got a postdoc job elsewhere called me after the completion of his first semester there; he had taught and graded along with PhD students in his new place and said it was refreshing and cathartic not to get harassed about simple matters in grading like he had been here. I have personally been talked to in a needlessly condescending way about minor (non)issues in grading, and in the beginning asked to regrade things for the flimsiest of (garbage) reasons. It is tiring to even talk about the nuisance created by this person in simple matters of grading; generally when I have graded with other faculty members here or at my previous university, things have been far more normal. Both her and X, after working with us for more than a year and apparently claiming to know us well, called me by another Indian PhD student’s name, which particularly in the US is considered very bad form.

There is yet another former PhD student here who I have seen behave in a very aggressive and condescending manner with other international students and I’ve talked with other international students about it. I myself always said hi and hello like is the custom in the US, and very rarely heard any hi or hello in return, and on one instance, as I was passing him by in the corridor, this PhD student looked at me in an extremely aggressive and ugly way, which would unnerve and make anyone feel unsafe, and if something like this happened on the streets you would move away as quickly as possible from there.

Coming to the incidents of Fall 2019, let's call the person Y, a PhD student whose desk was right next to mine in the office. Starting in September 2019, he would repeatedly put his boot on a chair pointing straight at me, just a couple of feet away from where I would be sitting and working, and when I asked him to stop this, he would do so and then resume a few days later, and then say I purposefully moved in the view of his feet so I could claim that his feet were pointing towards me. (I had earlier tried to make eye contact suggesting that this is really very poor, with me having to see the underside of his boots from a couple of feet away, but he didn’t respond to my very polite non-verbal cues.) Then a few days later, he would say in a very overbearing tone that we should now look at the configuration of the chairs so he could explain to me how his feet were not pointing towards me; this is after the chairs had all been moved around within the intervening days. Hearing all of this, I had told him 'I have work to do and don't want to engage your third rate ilk'; which is not a nice thing to say, but under the circumstances seemed quite necessary. Afterwards Y saw me in the corridor and came eyeball to eyeball, with an extremely threatening body language, standing inches from me, saying in a theatrical way, ""don't you ever disrespect me ever again"", because apparently that was his sole privilege.

After this he began keeping his bag on a chair very close to my desk and far from his desk, in some kind of passive aggressive show of force. I took a picture of this and showed our Director of graduate studies, let's call him Z, and he knew of the previous incident, and he asked me not to get worked up over it, and that he 'noted' it. I said it's better to change offices for me; and this is done informally by grad students all the time. However, Z personally intervened and said that's not necessary, and we should get along. This might have been due to a personal dislike of Z towards me. I was always polite with him but didn't think the world of him to take his Combinatorics 1 class, but took a Combinatorics 2 class taught by a prodigious postdoc in the department.( It turns out I got two papers on my own from that Combinatorics 2 class, one of which now got a favorable review from a top Combinatorics journal.)

Z was miffed, and told another faculty member (as narrated by this other faculty member to me) how I can at all do research in Combinatorics (doing Combinatorics research was never my plan anyway) if I didn't take his Combinatorics 1 class and in turn this faculty member relayed this to me. At that time, I met with Z and he told me that one of the aforementioned PhD students who said things like “you f—ing Indians” to me and behaved in offensive ways dozens of other times, was just “special”, and I should just learn to live with it. Then Z, being from a Western European country, told me in solidarity, after having seen the list of alleged incidents, that “Americans don’t dress well”, and there are other similar kinds of general problems we always deal with.

I’m not sure exactly and would hope they both did the right thing by asking this other graduate student to leave when they were talking about me, but Z and this faculty member were both saying condescending things about me, as this other faculty member himself told me coming out of the office they were speaking in. I was then asked to go to this office a minute later to speak with Z, and saw this other PhD student sitting in that office and it seemed like he was grading exams for a while. I would hope the PhD student was asked to leave for the time when these two faculty members were disparaging me.

On November 14 2019, as I was just entering the office in a bit of a hurry, and Y was coming out coincidentally at the very same moment, I did my best to move sideways, and there was a huge amount of room for him to move out, he deliberately rammed his shoulder into me, and kept ramming it into my body for a good few seconds. This now got into the territory of physical assault; and I immediately screamed about this, and a seminar was going on, and people got startled and closed the door.

There were no direct eyewitnesses to this. Later Z(grad advising head) told me that Y talked with him and that Y was minding his own business and that I started screaming at him unreasonably. Then Z said that if I complained about this to the Campus police, then I would probably get expelled. To the credit of the chair of the department, he intervened and said no one can get expelled like this.

Z, the graduate advising head, also looked at documentation which listed comments by X about Italians, Jews, Chinese, Indians, and documentation of all the bellicose attitude from him, and then declared that none of this is offensive(he wrote this in an email that is with me). Then he told me I should have just let it go when another PhD student started saying stuff beginning with “you fucking Indians” or something very similar, and when this was said in front of the teaching faculty member X, instead of getting further appalled, I should have reasoned with X.

It is sometimes next to impossible to function properly in this kind of environment; and especially when things can get into the territory of physical assault so quickly and a faculty member with an axe to grind in this manner could step in. Compared to the previous graduate program I had been in, this was just a casually toxic environment; things like a graduate student who ordered a book through Amazon from India because it was cheaper and then in front of everyone began mocking what apparently was (to him) the poor presentation of the book as it arrived, or when in a nearby university during an AMS meeting an Indian mathematician with a bit heavy accent was giving a talk, a graduate student from our department began to openly laugh at the accent, looking at me like why I didn’t also laugh at that accent; when all the few dozen other people in the room were being serious with the talk (and some attendees seemed to have been old friends and acquaintances of this Indian mathematician).

There’s another faculty member here who says loudly to another PhD student, both taking it in a joking manner apparently, “don’t steal my f%$#ing car, you Albanians steal cars”, and the PhD student finds it funny and goes around telling people how funny this is. I was in the office of this faculty member when he said this; interrupting what I was trying to discuss with him. At another time, this faculty member said to his Complex Analysis class, “we have to kill the poles in the denominator”, then paused, and then quipping “let’s not talk about WW2 now”. Here, poles is a mathematical term, and Poles also is apparently a reference to Polish people.

The question is, how do I tie these incidents together with the incidents from the other post, and mention how it can sometimes be very difficult to function in such an environment, and that they should immediately stop threats of expulsion? To the immense credit of the department, I now have a new office which is peaceful. However, right in the next office is a guy who has unnerved many of the legal aliens in the department with his weird and threatening body language and behavior.

Edit: I see that some people are saying how putting your feet up is not a big deal in the US. I've seen this among officemates before, some good friends of mine, and it was perfectly fine. In all those cases, they were not pointing their feet squarely at me with such an obviously poor body language, and they were polite enough that if I would tell them I found it disrespectful, they would be mindful of that. In this instance, I told this person to stop, yet he started doing the same thing after a few days, having the audacity to say I purposefully moved in view of his feet to claim this; as if I have nothing else to do. Hence my response was a necessity.

Update: Y has currently graduated and has been taken in as an instructor within our department and is apparently going to be teaching graduate courses. The other graduate student who used racial slurs against me was called special by Z and Z told me he deserves our understanding. At the same time, I’ve been constantly harassed and hounded by the university administration and threatened by their lawyers. This of course is explained by the fact that after the Office of Diversity and HR told me everything is fine, I asked them in return how they would like it if I made these things public knowledge.

Part3:

I'm an Indian Mathematics PhD student somewhere in the US, and have been working with a faculty member affiliated to a university near mine, from the beginning of 2019. At the end of November 2019, I completed the proof of a problem given to me, under the so called guidance of this faculty member, although he had very little to do with it for a long time, except one contribution in the end, which was commendable. Once he came up with this alternate way to prove what I had already proved, he immediately began to call my work rubbish, and said, you will only write my argument in your thesis. Towards the end, I implored him to write the part that he thinks he is correct in, since it was going to be a joint paper, but he said that no, I must rewrite things and incorporate his idea and do the rewriting even when it was going to be a joint paper.

An update to this is that the paper was quite late in being written by me; months after it should have already been written. I asked my advisor then to become a co-author but then surprisingly he refused; this is two months after I had stopped speaking with him. Recently the paper was peer reviewed by a very reputed journal and the referee said the arguments are all deemed correct.

He began to continuously berate and belittle everything I have done, and grew extremely hysterical when I suggested a similar but different result was also within reach, which he didn't think possible. We were once sitting in a casual eatery, and I was calmly trying to explain some arguments, and he seemed extremely agitated, talking over me, calling the arguments wrong, but then trying to explain the same thing to me, as if it was his argument.

I would have written up the project and sent for publication, but the extremely hostile attitude of this person stopped me from doing that. After mid-December, he again contacted me in the middle of January, and he expected me to regurgitate all the proofs to him again and again till the middle of March and do nothing else in that time with him. He would condescendingly tell me what according to him is right and what is wrong, in this time interval.

It's unbelievable that he would prevent me from writing down the next result which he believed was not possible, but which would take an hour to decide on, with a receptive person. I found this an unacceptable waste of my time, and also if I had to look for jobs and graduate in 2021, this was an unacceptable delay in sending the paper to a journal, although realistically the plan was to graduate in 2022.

I'm appalled by this kind of hostile attitude on a project where the techniques are so elementary, essentially nothing more than the pigeonhole principle is used, although things become a bit complicated. I would often tell him I have certain things figured out, and don't have to write it out since it is simple enough; and he would say OK; then next week he would completely berate me saying you know nothing about this. Perhaps not accustomed to working with someone who he feels superior to, that too from India, who did things much quicker than he anticipated.

I had been speaking with a noted emeritus faculty member here, who is a renowned Combinatorialist, and telling him what was going on, and he sounded genuinely sorry for me in this situation but told me he was powerless to do anything about it. He was the only person who sounded genuinely sympathetic in this situation, when I wrote to him saying, to paraphrase, “having been in another US university, I didn’t expect this kind of ethnocentrism to be propped up like this”. I also sent a futile email to Z about what was happening, who only replied writing that my then advisor would have solved the problem even if it was not for me. In a later correspondence, Z said that there was enough reasons to expel me on academic grounds.

Upon reporting this behavior in December 2019 to the department, I immediately began to get threats of expulsion. This is at the time when I had two publishable projects near completion. For my own good, I had to think to try to work with someone else, and I tried to talk with a faculty member about a particular problem in his area of expertise that I did substantial reading on and that I found interesting and wanted to work on. He completely ignored me. Despite this, during those times, at least 4 to 5 times I heard over a span of three months that my funding should get withdrawn and that the department would not be able to keep me.

The faculty member who I was once again interested in working with, had himself started advising an Indian student who was in his 4th year, in Spring 2018, although this student didn't have any completed projects till then. Our department is such that at least five people have changed advisors in their 4th year (at any single point we have &lt;30 PhD students) in the recent past, but none of them were threatened like me; and I doubt any of them could probably also objectively defend a thesis in their 4th year, before switching advisors, if they had to. Now I'm working with another mathematician in a nearby university, and in the process I have had to change to another area of research this late, which is not a great thing.

I work as a PhD student in a relatively big academic science institute in Europe, focusing on biology and chemistry. As member of the diversity and inclusion committee I am looking into organising some activities during the mental health awareness week (10-16 May). We were thinking about (virtually) hosting a speaker/therapist who could give a talk about mental health issues in academia. Preferably someone who can give some advice to PhD's and postdocs, but also to PIs about maybe recognizing signals from their students. As I think working in academia comes with a specific set of struggles and problems, familiarity with academia is an important requirement. Does anyone have any experience with such a person/talk? Or do you have other suggestions about how to reduce the stigma on mental health issues in beta science institutes.

I've managed to reach what I hope is the end, I'm still here, and at this point I just need the title for a chance at a fresh start. 

My advisor suggested that I would be a good fit to work with a new PI in a lab in a nearby city. I liked the subject area and could see how I could incorporate my own research interests into their project idea, so I agreed to chat. I started drafting up a postdoctoral grant application and my ideas were being received enthusiastically. However, whether through miscommunication or the usual complete lack of communication, my advisor has now inserted himself into the arrangement and decided that I would spend half my time in my PhD lab, and half in the new lab, with the majority of the project focused on his subject area, and with the thumbs up from the other PI. 

I don't want to pursue this application anymore as what I really want is a fresh start, and this isn't one. However, others who have ""burned"" my advisor have faced huge delays to thesis submission, and have gained terrible reputations within our department.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing looking for some advice and opinions on my situation and course of action. I'll give a brief description of my  situation and my goals and hoping a kind soul could give me some constructive advice. :)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 26 years old, turning 27 in the next couple months. I currently have a 3 year BA degree in a humanities field. I was enrolled in a 4 year Honours degree program and failed to submit the thesis because of crippling depression at the time because of family issues. It just so conveniently happened during the most important time of my academic career. I honestly have no idea what was going on with my mental health at the time, I thought that I could snap out of it eventually but let it linger on for 5 years until I got help. 

During that time, everything regarding my thesis collapsed. I couldn't finish it and settled with a failed grade, repressed the grief and tried to find another career. I couldn't find a career that was right for me because my heart was still in academia. I've been in therapy for 1 year now and uncovering the grief of that failed thesis and trying to find out what to do next.

My career plan during my time in University was to have a career within higher education, specifically as an academic lecturer (which requires a PhD). My transcript was prepped to continue on to enrol in Masters program (3.6/4.0 GPA) after which I planned to do my PhD.

Now with a failed thesis that has the weight of 3 regular courses, a 3 year degree, and 3.0/4.0 overall GPA (2.3 program GPA), I basically have no chance for grad school in my country. 

I spoke to an academic advisor and was told that I could submit a petition for exemption to academic rules where I could explain my situation and request to have the thesis removed from my transcript. If that would go through then I could redo any thesis. However, I'm not sure about the likelihood my request would be accepted. I have a hunch that you need a good, documented reason to be granted an exemption. My mental illness at the time wasn't documented so the only thing I could do is explain my situation, provide my therapy receipts and perhaps a therapist's reference note.

In any case, if that doesn't go through the only thing I could do is redo my thesis with he failed credits, still earn my 4 year Honours degree and leave with a low GPA. I still wouldn't be eligible for a Masters degree program. To meet my career goals, I think I'd need to do another Bachelors degree.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone have any advice how I could meet my career goal? Is it realistic at this stage in my life? Do I have any options that you'd recommend? Let me know if you'd need any more info that I could provide. 

Thanks for your help. Be kind, it's been a rough week for thinking about this. :p Cheers!

hillywho,t2_3xmy59i4,2019-06-29 19:56:35,c73t1r,6,"Hello everyone,

I had a terrible year because of mental health and family problems and was hoping to get some feedback about my petition. I have crossed out any names for confidentiality.

To the petitions committee at the XXX. I am writing in the hope to lift my academic suspension of one year and be readmitted in the Fall Semester of 2019. I understand how unconventional this request is, however, there were extenuating circumstances that affected my academic and social well being. These were affected by ongoing mental health problems and internal conflicts within my family. To begin, I need to describe what the root cause of my downfall this year has been. I have been facing depression, anxiety as well as some sort of attention disorder problems since late winter 2018. The cause of my current mental state is my mother (who I was previously living with), suffers from a very severe form of paranoid schizophrenia. My dad, who left me and my mom right after I graduated high school, suggested I move out because of my mom's delusions, irrational suspicions as well as complete dominance and control over my daily life. For example, in the fall of 2018, I took a course called MAT 246 which took place from 6PM to 9PM. Even though she knew my timetable, my mother wanted me to come home by 7:30 each day from XXX. She continuously insisted that I come home early because she had a suspicion that instead of attending lectures, I am having a personal relationship with another woman and my life is at risk. I just wanted to focus on my academic life however, everyday felt like an unwinnable battle. From complaints about people following her around the city, to horrendous claims that the government is trying to poison her, I just had to give in. There even came a point where she felt the microphones on my phone and laptop were being tapped, so as soon as I arrived home she used to confiscate my laptop and my phone because she felt, ""the people"" were listening through the microphones on my laptop. I went to seek help from my family doctor multiple times; however, the XXX Ministry of health cannot intervene unless patient is willing to accept the fact that he/she has a mental health problem. Frustrated, I started to bury all my feelings deep inside, embarrassed to share them with others. I didn't want to get my friends involved in my personal matters because I was afraid of what my mom would say to them. I thought moving to the downtown campus would help for a change, but it only made matters worse because of the longer commute and strict curfews that were imposed at home. I started becoming afraid of making mistakes on my evaluations for Math &amp; CS even though I knew that my answers were correct, I used to stay motionless for hours before an evaluation, completely stressed out even though I had practiced weeks in advance and knew the content. In late November, I started suffering from severe insomnia because of the lingering thoughts of getting questions wrong on a test. I realised I wasn’t going to make it through the two semesters at this rate, so I asked some of the professors at the downtown campus for help regarding course selection. One of the professors, XXX suggested I look at a few Philosophy courses that require less computation and more analysis. I decided to audit XXX (taught by XXX) which was like XXX a proofs course I took during my first year at XXX. Along with it, I took a course called XXX which focused purely on the analysis of statistics with very minimal computation. Even though my final mark in the course wasn’t great, I have realized that path focused more towards analysis rather than computation is better suited for me. Currently, I am auditing 2 courses during the summer at the downtown campus (because my internship is close by) which include XXX and XXX, courses focused on analysis. I want to switch my major to something in philosophy or cognitive science because I am traumatized by CS, Math &amp; Stats. I regret not getting help earlier during the school year however I was in denial the whole time, trying to fix the problems all by myself. I tried to reach out to CAMH multiple times however, the sheer ignorance and lack of understanding about mental health and the stigma revolving around it bested me. Plus, I tried going there in February &amp; March a couple of times, however I came back dissuaded because of the long wait times at the emergency services. Currently, I am undergoing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in order to get ready for the school year. Also, through CAMH I was able to connect with the university’s Student Progress &amp; Support services, where I sought help for managing the complexities of my circumstances. I have been in contact with XXX at the XXX Student Services Center, receiving help with my petition and my academic as well as social well being. I have always strived hard to do well in school, however because of these extenuating circumstances last year, it has been quite difficult to succeed. I hope the petitions committee can allow me to return to school in fall, as I am showing signs of recovery through Behavioural Therapy sessions. Currently, I am working during the summer and have enough money saved up to cover my living expenses as well as tuition for the next calendar year. Also, I am living a few blocks away from XXX campus which means I won’t have to commute either. I should have made better choices in the 2018-2019 school year; however, I wasn’t in the right state of mind and so I hope the university can give me this chance to prove myself.

I can correct this, in a few months time at the next PSYC appointment, but then I still have the issue of overcoming their objections due to my GPA.  

The GPA doesn't reflect a few facts:

* I benefited from academic renewal after four failures.  Counting these would result in a GPA of 2.77, and this is the GPA utilized by most other colleges for admission into their graduate programs.  The failed classes are still on my record, just not in my internal college GPA calculation
* I have had to withdraw from a semester due to mental health problems, but I withdrew before it was put onto my transcript
* the school's own counselor recommended I go inpatient, and said I should use ""medical withdrawl"" to do so.  
   * Medical withdrawl, IIRC, would prevent these things being on my transcript, but not in calculations for financial aid
* The added stress of explaining to instructors why I failed to get an assignment in on time, instructors either accepting it late or not, and then the huge added stress of compensating for these failures.  
* I was blessed with instructors last semester, who despite the fact that I didn't disclose my problems to them, never the less, I have reason to suspect they helped my grade.  One, I was one of the only students who participated in answering questions (sometimes interrupting before she was finished asking) and I was asked to allow other students to answer.  I then waited for those long pauses before answering.  The other I did the best they'd ever seen on an exit exam, probably thanks to ASD and some mania.  I finished in 10 minutes with 100% in comparison to other students who mostly got 70s, and took the full 50 minutes (this was a physics class)

&amp;#x200B;

My problems are numerous, and they focused on a narrow set of statistics which doesn't show the problems I face every day that are not encountered by my classmates who are gifted with better mental health than I am.  

Main diagnoses and related problems:

* ASD
   * anxiety
      * Giving presentations is very difficult, but tolerable
      * I have the general feeling of anxiety from the morning until I return home
   * social problems, poor grades in classes that require conversation in class
      * That english class where I did poorly because of this still bothers me
   * very shy at telling anybody when I need help, no friends in class to rely on for notes and help
   * This helped me in physics and math, courses I am no longer taking, but which contributed to my good GPA.  EX: last semester I did so good in physics ( [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/97d0/557e1f02f6e9b7f10a5d789c84cc653a8d8b.pdf](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/97d0/557e1f02f6e9b7f10a5d789c84cc653a8d8b.pdf) )
* Bipolar
   * Mania helped one semester ( the spring one)
   * depression did me in on two semesters (the last one being the summer semester)

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest fears probably cannot even be alleviated with any accommodations:

* withdrawl affecting student loans
   * repayment may become due the moment I am no longer enrolled half time, although I'm not sure
   * SAP may very well be affected
* academic difficulties affecting GPA for addmission into other programs not recognizing academic renewal 
   * there's probably no hope to fix the 2.77 GPA now

So my questions to you professors, and perhaps other students:

* would you disagree with someone who had these problems getting accomodations?  despite the high institutional GPA?  
* Should I not pursue this any further?  (my fear is when I need help, I will not have anything that says I can get it)
* Should I just get the documentation with the the codes to the accuracy they would like, and then, if they disagree again, note that the GPA doesn't take all the other things into account?",academia,"What is your honest opinion on accomodations for a student with mental health problems, but has a good GPA?"

We are approaching the end of my third application call since I decided that I wanted to walk in academia, but apparently I am done already. I applied for something like 20 different positions in the last year. I was able to get 1 interview in that, that was unsuccessful.

I graduated in the top 10% in psychology, in a joint program between two European countries. This allowed me to be able to enroll in a Russell league uni in the UK without much effort for a MSc in a quantitative subject, but my last year's been hell on Earth.
Aside from my health problems (I suffer from a quite severe depression, that was worsened by relocation and this situation), speaking English as a second language, and some economic difficulties (I had funds for studying abroad, but clock's ticking), I didn't perform well in my course as I wanted to. 
I discovered to be skilled in quantitative data analysis and biostatistics, though. I know three programming languages quite fluently, I have loads of material in my folders demonstrating it. I worked as a volountary RA for two projects involving quantitative data analysis. I might have a publication out in the next year too.
I am currently following up some projects with my MSc supervisor, but it's all gratuitous work and this situation cannot last too long. Not that I am not motivated,but it takes time (that I need to work to live, y'know) and resources (that I don't have).

I am trying to apply to anything involving quantitative data analysis. My hope would be to be able to switch to biostatistics, with a PhD or some RA experience in this, but at this point I don't even know how to get there. I applied to loads of positions I thought they would be plan B or Cs, but I didn't even get an interview in those either. Despite not needing a visa, I cannot even get funding from the BRC/ESRC because I don't haven't lived here long enough.

Is there a trick for this? Is there something that I am completely missing? What I am supposed to do now?

I am just excluding relocating again, because I moved from 3 countries in 3 years; it's not been good for my mental health and I don't think I can push me any further with this. Starting off knowing no one in a place where I probably wouldn't speak the local language either would quite literally drive me even more insane that I am now.",academia,"I am not in yet, but I am out already (UK)"
Movladi_M,t2_4ougwx2x,2019-11-27 05:26:04,e2b970,1,"Greetings, 

I would like to ask for some feedback on whether it is possible to salvage anything out of my “career” in life sciences. It is quite difficult  to write calmly about my experiences, nonetheless, I will try to stay away from my grievances and emotions. 

Originally, I come from the ex-USSR country. I’ve got my Masters degree (biology) then moved to Germany into one of their “International Life Sciences PhD programs”. It was indeed very diverse and international, so it was very good for improving my English skills in writing, speaking, presenting – you name it (still, not as good as an English-speaking country would be). However, my experience turned out to be very frustrating. Shortly after starting in the lab, I noticed that PhD students and postdocs were treated badly, people were unhappy (but tried to hide it). A sort of “scientific gambling” was running at that place – i.e. there were close to 30 people in the lab at the peak, which were divided between 5 totally different projects, all running in parallel under same PI. Essentially, if anyone found something worthy of “Nature” than it had a chance to be published. If not, the PI didn’t bother at all. More career-minded postdocs left the place by themselves promptly, realizing that they were not able to move their career to the next level. More relaxed people that didn’t care about career and were on good terms with PI, stayed for 5 years and more, achieving very little in terms of measurable output. PhD students were hurt particularly bad, as many of them had to defend without publications. There was no meaningful supervision whatsoever, no “Plan B” etc. recommendations were also a huge problem – the PI simply didn’t bother to write them and didn’t mind writing nasty recommendations for people that he disliked personally. Essentially, my project didn’t produce any meaningful results. Initially the project looked O.k., but after working for some time, I clearly understood that it is a junk! I have asked (both PI privately and raised my concerns at the theses committee) for a side-project, for a parallel project – for anything that could yield a paper! Neither PI, not the thesis committee supported me. At the end, I defended my thesis and got a Ph.D., but it costed me a lot of excruciating mental pain, I didn’t have publications and could not count for any support (even a recommendation letter) from my PI. I managed to find a position of a postdoc with a young PI, who turned out to be a “slave driver”. Essentially, I had to work 60 to 70 hr a week for a salary of a janitor at the same university. I wouldn’t complain about money, if the work yielded anything. Besides my main project (which would be O.k, but could not be published within reasonable time), I worked as a technician for collaborators. The PI wanted his name in the authors list (to boost his publication record), so he “schmoozed” different collaborators and “slaved out” his people to do menial work for their research. The stream of these “collaborations” never stopped. True, I am “the first author” of a book chapter (a useless review, in essence) and 7 or 8 other papers with my name as 4th, 5th or 6th author (which is again pretty useless). After considering all pros and cons, I left for the first job I could find. It was not worth to pull 60-hr weeks, for salary of a janitor at the third-rate university. If any of these conditions were different, I would have stayed and tried to publish a paper as a first author. Now you can understand from where I am coming. 

At present, I work as a project manager (I am a Canadian citizen now). I am reasonably satisfied with my present job, only (and significant) downside – it is a “soft” money position (no union, no safeguards). This worries me because 1) I am single and do not have a support network of any sort; 2) I am tired of relocating and would ultimately like to settle down and 3) “academia” took a heavy toll on my health. I am trying to think about what back-up options I have and how bad they are. This is where you feedback is needed most:

1) The “biotech” industry is almost non-existent in Canada; there are few companies in Toronto and Vancouver, but their reputations are rather bad and compensation is not matching the cost of living in those places. Besides that, it is well known that the “industry” likes people with B.Sc. or M.Sc. but not Ph.Ds (overqualified). 

2) Many Universities are laying off people or on hiring freeze in Canada amid funding cuts now. Overall, economy is rather anemic from what I see on streets.

3) In all honesty, I do understand that I am not competitive for any decent “research” positions within academia with exception of a technician or a lab-manager (same as a technician) at most. I have never lectured as a TA either (my experience in Germany was 24/7 hands-on lab). I am too old for all postdoc grants or to be a postdoc in general.

4) As it appears to me, I cannot achieve anything within present academic power structure – I do not have a Ph.D from top-tier university, do not have a supportive “big-name” PI and do not have a stellar publication or grant record and I have no way to compensate for any of it anymore. You get only one attempt at academic career. On the other hand, I do not want to waste my time criticizing academia either.

One possibility I am considering is getting myself a certificate of English Instructor, so I could go Asia to teach kids in some kind of school or gymnasium. Another option would be a sort of lecturer position in some second or third tier university somewhere in Asia again. The reason I am looking at Asia is that it the only region with an economic growth (of sorts). In all other places I see only stagnation or decline.",academia,Salvaging something out of failed life sciences career?
Runebro,t2_bq9kd,2019-12-28 11:58:52,egpzns,1,"Hi all, 

Recently I was in the very fortunate position to receive a scholarship to begin a PhD.  Since accepting the offer I have been quite anxious and nervous about whether starting and working on a PhD, particularly in this topic area is the right thing to do.

The cons/second thoughts: While I find the topic of my PhD and it's respective area very interesting, I am not sure yet if this is an area I want to be working on for the majority of my life, and if I do truly want to be an academic or a researcher (as this is really all I know); nearly every 3 weeks my ideal career path changes (albeit, kinda still in a related field). The topic of my PhD is just an area I would like to learn about and contribute to research in. That said, the topic of my PhD is quite different to what I did my undergrad in. I have to develop a range of skills in coding, maths, and many other topic areas before I can even begin to understand the related areas, and I am finding this quite difficult; the thought of juggling this learning on top of a PhD is quite overwhelming. While I hope to finish a PhD, I am worried that I will just drop out because of a PhD's difficulty and the impact of a PhD on my mental health. 

Why I want to do a PhD: If I do end up enjoying academia/research, the skills I develop in this area would allow me to go on and answer questions that would have implications across multiple-disciplines, which is very exciting. I am excited about the idea of attending conferences and discussing research with leading experts. I am always in awe of the critical thinking and analytical skills that PhD graduates have, as well as their capacity for effective and efficient independent work.  I really like the idea of contributing to new knowledge in a field and then being able to communicate it. Ultimately, if I do complete a PhD, the new knowledge and skills I have developed will help me across many jobs, including those not academic/research based. I have approximately a years experience researching in other fields, and while I do find it boring at times, I prefer doing this over any other job I have had (all my previous jobs were quite bad - retail).

If I wasn't going to start a PhD, I honestly have no clue what I would do with my life, other than continuing to work in research assistant positions and retail. Without a PhD i can't really utilise my university degrees in a meaningful way, I would have to go do masters if I don't do a PhD (which I am on the fence about, as the masters programs in my field are very difficult programs and there's a 3-10% chance of getting a place after applying). Some of the PhD graduates I have talked to who did the same undergrad stream as me said they did their PhD purely so they were doing something with their life.

I was born in Germany and completed high school/grammar school here, then moved to the UK for higher education. The UK's university system can be a little fast-track: I completed my undergraduate degree in 2 years, 3 months; my masters in 1 year; and my PhD in 3.5 years. This led to me graduating from my PhD at age 27, two months before my 28th birthday. My masters and PhD were at a Russell group uni, my undergrad was not. My PhD took a crazy toll on me, I gained 35kg (~6ish stones) from mental health issues and disordered eating.

After working in the UK for a wee while, I applied for and was offered a great job in Germany, so I moved back. In Germany, after you complete your 3-4 year PhD, you complete ""habilitation"" which qualifies you for a professorship/chair. If you want to stay in research. Habilitation takes 7odd years or so, I am told. 

This is where it gets juicy. I, my PI and another collaborating professor wanted to attend a conference. All three of us collaborate very smoothly and happily - most of the time. The collaborator asked me if I knew whether the free conference registration was valid only for a PhD student. I confirmed this. He was disappointed. My PI asked why the collaborator was disappointed. Collaborator explained that we didn't have any suitable PhD students. My PI said in full self-confidence that I was a PhD student and I should go for free. Our collaborator‘s and my face slipped and we reminded him that I was a graduated PhD, not a student. 

I thought this was the end of. However, two days later my PI phoned me to tell me that I do not have a PhD, and was adamant about it. I explained to him that to do a PhD in the UK, you enroll at uni and you are a student and when you graduate, you may call yourself a PhD, or Dr So and so. I explained I graduated in 2018 and was a PhD. He disagreed vehemently. I explained that PhD means doctor of philosophy which indicates the person has a scientific doctorate. And that that was what I had. He vehemently disagreed. He explained to me that a PhD involved several YEARS in research and publishing papers, and that it was closer to a habilitation than a doctorate. So someone at age 27/28 couldn't possibly have a PhD. I told him that it was true that it took several years and that I completed these years in 2018 and am thus a PhD. He, again, vehemently disagreed. And then told me that he was 99% confident he was correct in this opinion. I was so baffled, I actually went on to google the situation after a mutually frustrating call. Near the end, both of us were raising our voices defensively. 

I was incredibly upset and shook by having my PhD qualification essentially denied like that, and so vehemently. I wonder what I could have done better to make him see my point? To make him
understand that I do in fact have a PhD and that yes, it is a PhD?

d10874665,t2_5ef0cquq,2020-01-08 16:26:37,eluyfw,1,"I want to share a story of my over a decade long research career.  A career that started with love and passion, and is now slowly coming to an end due to burnout.  I'm not sure why I'm writing this here.  I think I just feel a need to share it anonymously with fellow academics and maybe hear an idea how to get out of this situation.

I work in the area of Computer Science. I started programming in my early teens and had a natural talent for it. Studying CS (MSc) was an obvious decision and I was one of top students (I don't want to boast - but objectively speaking that's how it was).  My supervisor suggested that I stay at the university as a PhD student.  I was reluctant at first, since this was not a career I had imagined for myself, but eventually he managed to convince me and I am glad that he did.  I quickly feel in love with this job.  I was doing what I liked the most - programming - and I had a huge freedom of organising my time, something my friends that went into the industry, I saw, did not have.  My PhD went smooth - aside from occasional self-doubt and usual fears that ""I will never get this PhD"" - and I was offered a permanent position at the same university.  (If this sounds strange - I come from a country where this is possible and you don't need to work for years to maybe get a tenure.)  However I personally ended up being very disappointed with my thesis.  It felt like I am not solving real-life problems and not making an impact with my research.  In hindsight my thesis wasn't as bad as I had imagined back then, but as a result of this disappointment and perceived failure I decided to change my research topic to a different area of computer science, one that has always interested me but I have never had the time to explore.  This was a good decision.  I was fascinated by this new topic and spent every moment exploring it.  I worked for up to 14 hours a day, 6 days a week but none of this even felt like work.  It was pure passion.  After several months I managed to get an internship in a renowned research institute and collaborate with one of the most famous researchers in this area.  I was finally solving real-life problems and making an impact.

However, while the above looks like a total success, not everything was going perfectly.  I was completely self-taught in this new area of research and while I read a lot - several books and probably over a hundred papers, including both the latest research as well as relevant historical papers - it became obvious to me that my knowledge is incomplete.  I would often realise that I don't know some fairly basic things that are normally taught to graduate students. Moreover, no one in my institute was familiar with this new field and I was working completely on my own.  As mentioned, I have made some contacts during my internship and I managed to collaborate with these people and publish some very good papers with them.  However, I started to feel very frustrated about this. Even if I was able to come up with a research idea and carry out 80-90% of work entirely on my own I still needed someone to help me with the remaining 10-20% that I was simply not able to do on own my due to lack of skill.  I know that this is how most of the research is done, but I knew I can't expect these people to always help me since they have their own research and no obligations towards me. 

I knew that if I want develop and survive as a scientist I need to work and learn under an experienced supervisor.  I needed a way out, even if I were to give up my permanent position at the university. Which I did. An opportunity presented itself and after about 4 years since defending my thesis at my old university (one where I also got both my MSc and PhD) I was accepted for a post-doc position in one of the most renowned research institutes in the world (in my new field of research).  On paper things were looking perfectly, but the person of the PI leading the project (and thus my new manager) turned out to be a huge problem.  He is a very nice and kind person, is very smart, has a very good knowledge of the field, but completely lacks management skills and the ability to manage people or make any kind of decisions.  He can barely organise his own work, let alone the work of others.  This new position quickly became a torment.  I was initially assigned to work on things that lie outside of my expertise area and - even worse - completely outside of my scientific interest.  After about a year I have managed to make some corrections and steer towards more interesting topics, but a lot of damage was already done.  Second problem is that despite there being several people working on the project (both PhD students and postdocs), PI organised our work in such a way that each person works independently from everyone else.  Again, I have found myself in a position where I work completely alone and without any supervision - which was the thing I wanted to escape the most during my previous position.  Despite his knowledge the PI does not provide me with any helpful feedback, he is vague, and like I mentioned cannot make any kind of decision, including research decisions. I have spoken with other people on the project and they feel the same about having to work on their own and on things that don't really interest them. Knowing this at least makes me feel sane.  We try to correct this as much as possible behind our PI's back (for example by helping each other with problems) but this is only a partial solution.

I have now completed the third year of my post-doc and I still have one more year to go.  During these last three years there have been a couple of bright moments when research felt enjoyable, but all these moments were a result of collaborations with other people in the institute, which happened sort of randomly (someone from outside of the project stepped in with a research idea and dragged us into a collaboration).  Looking at the list of my publications during this post-doc I see that none of them is a result of my PI's research initiative.  All of these issues resulted in a lot stress for me, leading to problems with mental and physical health.  I feel that instead of developing my knowledge and skills I've been only forgetting them.  I spend most of my days procrastinating and if I can get 4 hours of work in a day that's a success - my attention span went down from hours to mere minutes. Programming used to be one of my favourite activities and I would write hundreds, if not thousands, of lines of code a week.  Now I don't even write a hundred lines of code a month.  This is hard to describe but I feel a mental blockade that prevents me from undertaking intellectual activities, be it learning new things, reading papers, developing my own ideas, or programming (even for fun).  I feel completely burned out and want to to give up my academic career and try to find a different job.  But the thought of doing so makes me sad.  I really used to like academic work.  It gave me a sense of purpose and accomplishment.  All of this makes me really sad - I know that I am a smart person but I just don't feel it.  I want to be in an environment where I can put my skills to good use and grow but I fear that in my current state I won't be able to, even if I find a different job.  Also, I feel that by getting a job in the industry I will lose the freedom I value so much in academic work. At the same time I don't imagine doing another postdoc.

I've been trying to get help by going to counselling but this has not been very effective so far.  Similarly with other things like meditation or physical activity - i.e. stuff typically recommended to fight stress and anxiety.  None of these things really help.  I wonder if any of you been in a similar situation and found a way out?",academia,[PostDoc confessions] Burnout is about to end my research career

I initially intended to pursue a degree in cognitive neuroscience when I entered college. Graduated in 2.5 years with a 4.0 and 2 research lab experiences. No publications but good relationships with professors. I decided not to pursue academia due the work-life balance issues and instability. I've since been thinking about becoming a psychiatric nurse practitioner (I know this involves floor nurse experience first). Nursing attracts me because of the job market and the number of specialty options within the field.  


The issue is, I'm really not sure being a nurse practitioner would satisfy me. I've considered being a mental health counselor as I find therapy a bit more interesting than straight up med management. However, I'm not sure I'm cut out to be a mental health counselor. I'm great with people but I'm more interested in problem solving than simply ""helping others."" Ideally, med management AND therapy would be my dream, as it would allow me to understand the whole person and prescribe accordingly.  


I'm toying with the idea of getting a PhD in clinical psych (or even neuropsych because sensory perception is my jam) with intents of becoming a clinician. Due to my interest in personality disorders, being an NP might limit me to simpler cases (mood disorders, anxiety). Also, from what I understand, psychologists I could publish on the side while having clinical work as my main profession. Being able to do meta-analyses, lit reviews, or even small studies would be amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

If I decide nursing isn't for me, would trying to get a PhD in clinical psych after 2-3 years out of the academic world be difficult? I was told a break from academia would hurt me in research based PhD programs, but I'm not sure about clinical programs.

I miss the good old days of undergrad where I could write 50 pages in a week for various essays, because I was dealing with much less information and was putting much less pressure on my shoulders. Nowadays, I have **so many mental blockages** about writing that it's nearly impossible for me to write anything new. I can't write at home anymore, whereas I would work on my messy desk for hours on end in undergrad. I can't write if I'm ""not feeling it"". I can't write if I don't have a whole day (or at least more than 3 hours) in front of me. I can't bring myself to finish anything because of the fear of ""being dumb"", or because I have so many information to deal with that it's hard to figure out any ""natural"" order my discourse should adopt, or because there's always another aticle that I could include in citations. Ever since I've been in grad school, the writing process has been incredibly tedious, proportionally to how the research is just so much fun. I see people left and right pumping articles like it's cupcakes, while I can spend **whole days** on a single paragraph. 

Obviously, I'm not blind to underlying reasons for these difficulties.

darkmatterhunter,t2_uf1u6,2019-03-17 08:41:58,b237w9,7,"I’m 2 years into a 4-year PhD and I’m at the point of counting down the days until I can leave. Thankfully, I absolutely love my research and my advisor (for the most part lol) and that’s honestly the only thing keeping me going.

My problem stems from the following:

- I had to file 4 Title IX complaints against people in my department. The guys will *not* take no for answer. Some pursued me for over a year and became sexually aggressive or harassed me via text, even when I clearly did not respond to any communication or clearly said no to attempts to hang out. I would be approached in class, my office (showing up unannounced), or “dropping by” my apartment. I stopped showing up to class and required seminars to avoid it. I was not aware their actions were in violation of Title IX until someone pointed it out to me. 1 one of these people was a friend, another was a close friend, and another was borderline best friend. It seems to be a case of unrequited love, but that doesn’t excuse them to treat me like shit or ignore lack of consent. This happened over the course of the last 15 months and was just one person after the other.

- note, I’ve been asked out/pursued my entire life, even when I clearly had a SO and I’ve never had 6 people mistreat me because I said no. I grew up in CA, went to undergrad in NY, and am now in KS. Is this just coincidence or some weird midwestern behavior? Everyone I’m discussing is from the area or a nearby state.

- there were 2 additional Title IX-ish behaviors of people, one of them graduated, so I didn’t bother. The other has been chastising me for not texting him back after he gave me his phone number unprompted. I’ve been out of the country for 2 weeks and I’m dreading him stopping by my office and asking why I didn’t text him.

- I had to cut out these people, or they eventually cut me out. This excluded me from pretty much every friend group in the department. I never hang out with anyone or get invited to things anymore, which sucks realizing that they only cared because they wanted something physical out of me. All of my other friends live on either coast and I’m an only child with parents old enough to be advisor’s parents lol. I’m effectively friendless day-to-day.

- my only friend in the department is one of those people where you say “can’t live with them, can’t live without them.” If we didn’t work together, I probably wouldn’t put so much effort in. She is toxic and downright mean. She does things like tell me that I’m an overachiever and make everyone in the department look bad because I’m ambitious and driven, even by doing things like joining swim club. I never brag or gloat about grants and fellowships I receive, but she even told me that she automatically hated me when I was accepted because the department announced that I was on a prestigious fellowship. She views the successes of others as her own failures and constantly projects this.

- for solutions, I have done the following: joined marching band for a year to try a new friend group. I’m nearly a decade older and I couldn’t deal with the teen drama as most of them went to HS together.

- joined swim club for the last 2 seasons. It’s ok, not drama but the group is dwindling to 5-10 people and it’s more of an activity rather than friendship thing.

- work out outside of swimming, it helps with mental health and such.

- spoke with CAPS and the ombudsman. CAPS doesn’t really do much for me, they said given the circumstances, I seemed to be positive and doing all I can. I didn’t like the ombuds approach - they told me everyone else had unmet needs and I need to cater to them. I discussed this with my advisor and he agreed we couldn’t do anything about the negativity of my only friend.

- I despise the weather in KS. It has been a harsher winter the past 2 years than it normally is. I’m also very into outdoors stuff and hiking - KS doesn’t cut it for me and I leave every academic break to go somewhere else. It helps, but I dread getting back on the plane and landing here.

- I’ve picked up hobbies like reading (again). 

- I had a rapid onset of allergies to cats and dogs, so I can’t volunteer in the animal shelter anymore. I have a pet lizard and he’s great, but I can’t really get anymore with my travel.

I don’t want to live my life borderline hating everyday, but that’s the point I’m at. I’m even considering driving home and *living with my parents* for part of the summer (I left for college 10 years ago and haven’t been home for more than 3 weeks at a time). I figure if I’m at least near hiking and a better outdoor situation, that could help. Any ideas or suggestions? I don’t want to look back negatively on this part of my life/career that will be a huge defining moment and I want to make the best of it.

The power structures in academia are deeply troubled and cannot be salvaged. 

For example, a first-year female PhD student was convinced into coming in to the lab at absurd hours to check on experiments. This was a bit frustrating, but she thought it was just something she'd have to be willing to accept to her to pursue this wonderful opportunity!

Over time, her advisor began criticizing her work. There were mistakes and she was pressured to increase her hours in the lab. She saw less of her friends and became more committed to finding a way to please her advisor.

By the second year, she was spending nearly all her waking hours in the lab. She had little contact with anyone who was not part of the lab. She was fully committed. She was in the lab alone at night and in weekends, except for when a post-doc or the advisor were there. She was dedicated to her important work! 

**She was repeatedly sexually assaulted.** After a long period of silent trauma, she made a complaint. The department protected the advisor. She left the university and got a job working at a grocery store.

It doesn't matter what field you are in. The power imbalance in academia is exploitative to the very core. A math student is just as likely to put a bullet through her brain as an literature student.

So, I think I'm in a strange situation right now. I had to leave my PhD a few months ago due to some reasons at this very fancy uni in my country (has a good international reputation).

It was mostly because, the faculty I was working with was a kind of bully and working with him for a long time would work affected my mental health significantly. 
I have a paper published in a journal from that time I worked with him.

I kept no contact with that prof after I left that place to keep myself same and while I was leaving, I did not argue or fight with him or anyone just because it's not professional and also because I'm not an idiot and our paths may cross sometime in the future. So, you can say that I went on my seperate way quite peacefully with no drama. 

Now, after months I'm reapplying for a PhD mainly to Europe and some North American universities. And I am being advised to take his recommendation letter and being told that I should talk to him because he will be contacted since I have a paper with him so it's better that I talk to him myself. And some even said that I'm sabotaging my career by not talking to him and should just put up with it. And that the worst he can do is say no.

But given the dynamics of my relationship with him I don't really want to email him again and ask for a favor.

What do you think is advisable in this situation? Thanks!

mistixs,t2_n7ux4,2017-04-12 01:20:45,64v5hs,1,"I ask because, while there's no doubt that grad school is stressful, I wonder if part of the reason may be because mentally ill people are more likely to enter grad school.

I mean, studies do show that mental illness rates are higher among not only researchers, scientists, artists, and writers, but also their families, implying that part of it is genetic (as opposed to situational.) http://www.livescience.com/24023-study-strengthens-link-between-creativity-and-mental-illness.html

Thus I wasn't surprised to see that mental illness rates were highest in Arts majors and lowest in Business majors. https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-love-and-war/201511/graduate-school-and-mental-illness-is-there-link

Also, apparently mental illness rates are higher among Psychology majors. I wonder if part of the reason may be that these people's mental illnesses are what made them interested in psychology.

I think I personally might be an example because I'm considering grad school and I have bipolar disorder, anxiety, and OCD.

I'm hoping that the main cause of grad school's higher mental illness rates is due to mentally ill people (like me) simply being more likely to enter grad school, rather than grad school taking a massive toll on mental health, in which case grad school may not be for me, someone who is already less than stable.

academiaquestion1,,2017-08-02 00:47:29,6r0ncv,3,"**Background**: undergraduate who has faced numerous obstacles, including domestic violence, homelessness, and severe mental health issues. Trying to appeal for withdrawal/removal of grades from past semester(s).

**Story**: My registrar's office rejected the first appeal on the grounds that 1) C-'s aren't low enough for removal (I wish I had known and not tried!) 2) severe domestic violence and severe mental health issues aren't severe enough circumstances.

Rejected petition in hand, I went to every academic and counseling resource I could find at my school, asking for advice. All the university officials seemed scared to give me advice on my case, as though they didn't want to break any rules by helping(?) me too much. One secretary *did* tell me that I should try soliciting letters from professors.

So now I've emailed two professors, asking for help.

One of these professors gave me a C- in a class where my otherwise D/F-grade was bloated by extra credit/work. He also had a TA to whom I had mentioned my anxiety. Remembering these things, I asked him to write a note explaining that 1) my grade was a ""pity grade"" and 2) that I had mentioned anxiety to the TA. He tersely replied by refusing to acknowledge that he gives out ""pity grades,"" and then he said that the TA doesn't remember me mentioning anxiety.

Frustrated but persevering, I emailed a second professor--this one a private music teacher whose classes I received A's in. I've mentioned that I've dealt with domestic violence, homelessness, and mental health issues to this professor before. She has a pessimistic personality, thinks mental health issues are a scam, and discourages a lot of students from their career and academic goals. But, nonetheless, she's the professor I've known best and longest. So I asked her for a note supporting my petition. Discouragingly, she ignored all the personal circumstances I informed her of and instead threw out insults, lambasting me for ""trying to raise my GPA."" In the end, she has now told me she's only willing to write a ""short note"" speaking to my ""character and honesty."" But she also admonished me and insisted that my actions are misguided and going to result in a rejected appeal ""because [I'm] just trying to raise my GPA.""

**Conclusion/help request**: So, at this point, I've faced myriad obstacles, but I'm desperately trying to figure out *how to strengthen my appeal's case.* My school told me that this second appeal is my last chance at the matter. I'm going to ask my private therapist for a note; I'll reuse a note from a previous university therapist; and I'll have a note from this other pessimistic professor. The notes from the school therapist and private therapist will likely only say ""we saw this patient on (dates way after the bad semesters),"" because of their medical regulations or what have you.

randomprecision1331,,2018-02-22 01:34:12,7zb18n,5,"Summary of situation:

- Fourth year at a community college
- Terrible students, terrible morale, toxic coworkers. Everyone there looks miserable or worn out or both.
- Five years experience as an adjunct at three four year schools before that.
- Live an hour away because I don't want to live in the rural area the college is in.

I want to quit after this year something fierce. I have had it with the awful students, low morale, miserable people all around. Every day is a struggle to go to this hellhole. I actually miss being an adjunct because I did that at good schools where students paid attention and did fairly well, as opposed to basically talking to a wall day in and day out at this dump. The ONLY reason I took this job was because it was full-time.

Over the past four years I have become severely depressed. I feel no connection to the job, the people there, or where I currently live since I had to move to be closer to this job and I'm still too far from everyone I know. I don't feel like an active participant in life anymore. I go to work, I come home, I don't do much else.

I have about $25K in savings, no loans of any kind, no dependents, no financial responsibilties other than rent and utilities.

I want to resign after this year, move somewhere I actually want to live (probably back to my old neighborhood), and regroup. I *need* to regroup. This college has been the worst mistake of my life.

I am pretty much willing at this point to live off my savings for an extended period of time to escape this misery, but I am worried about the long-term effects on my future employment with a gap of a year or so (if I possibly get back into academia somewhere else). I am concerned future employers will not understand taking time off for mental health reasons.

I feel lost and don't know what to do anymore. Leaving this job and regrouping will do wonders for me in the short term, but I am worried about the long term. Teaching is the only career I've had and I view my chances of getting another job outside academia as not that great as a result.

drblorpenstein,t2_y6049,2016-05-24 05:56:09,4kse4g,7,"Hi, there's a lot to say about this but I'll try to keep it as brief as possible so as not to bore you or lose your attention.

I'm in my 5th year of a PhD program. Shortly after I joined the group, another guy, let's call him Dave, joined too. My advisor had kind of hyped him up to us in the time preceding him arriving, and for good reason: he's very good and accomplished in the area he knows, so on paper he was an excellent catch for the group.

After being there for a bit, I learned (from him, he's fairly open about it) that he suffers from several diagnosed mental health problems, like bipolar disorder, sleep troubles, and depression. Those have been diagnosed and he has medication for them. The problem is that he heavily abuses prescription drugs (that he has prescriptions for). 

Very early on, when I only knew him a little, I got pretty scared when he kind of disappeared and didn't respond to texts or anything for 3 or 4 days. I was debating calling someone but decided not to. After a couple days, he showed back up, as if basically everything was normal. 

I soon found out that this was a pattern for him: he'd basically binge on Adderall when he got a new prescription at the beginning of the month, stay up for ungodly amounts of time, and then to avoid the crazy/delirium from staying up, he'd take a lot of Ambien/Klonopin, and pass out for absurd amounts of time. I've done my share of this stuff, and he takes pretty heroic/stupid amounts.

So this shocked me at first, but I realized that he *kind* of had it under control, or at least knew what he was doing. Obviously, doing this amount and combination of drugs isn't ""control"", but it didn't seem like he was going to OD or something.

What's changed recently is that, he used to actually get a lot of work done when he was on an Adderall binge. He'd basically be working for like 5 days straight, and he's very smart, so he'd end up averaging out (counting the time after that he spends sleeping for several days straight) to about the same amount of work as a normal person gets done. But in the past few months, it's seemed like he's barely working at all. When he binges, he ends up doing stupid shit like organizing things that don't need to be organized for hours, optimizing it. I'll also not really see him for a while, and then he'll come into our office on a Friday evening, getting ready to go out to some bars/clubs. He'll get pretty wrecked over the course of the weekend and then not come in for most of the week, and then pretty much do the same thing weekly.

To be clear, I'm not actually concerned about his work productivity; I'm concerned about what it implies. If he doesn't care about what he's doing here, and he has spent ~5 years floundering, I wonder if something has changed and he may start making worse and more harmful choices.

Most recently, he got some coke, and has been doing that in the office. I'm totally fine with coke being used recreationally in general, but in his case I think it's worrying when he's made the transition from (albeit stupid amounts) of drugs he legally has prescribed, to street drugs, because that means pretty much anything is on the table.

He went away to rehab maybe 6 months ago. He came back and seemed fairly serious about not fucking around too much anymore, but it didn't last long. I think he's gone before a few times too.

Our advisor knows that he has the *health problems* he does, but he doesn't really know about the drug habits; he ascribes Dave's strange behaviors to the health problems. He has heard rumors though. Things get around, some grad students are closer with their advisors, they see stuff, they mention it, etc. He's been what I would call infinitely patient, considering he's been supporting a guy for 5 years who has yet to show a single publication while here.

The other person who knows the full extent of Dave's problems is a postdoc we both know well. He seems generally worried, but I guess not worried enough to pursue anything (if there is anything to do). We've talked about it but haven't really concluded anything beyond that it's tricky.

Dave has a girlfriend who lives a few states away who seems generally concerned about him. For example, a few weeks ago she called the postdoc in a panic and had him try to get in contact with Dave, because she was very worried about him. When he went to Dave's apartment, there was also a policeman whom she had called. He was actually just sleeping, but my point is just that her reaction says something. I have no idea how much she knows, but I imagine everything, since they've been together for a while.

I've talked to him a few times, just telling him to take it easy, maybe not do the craziness he does, but when it comes down to it, he seems (and he's pretty much said as much) that he's really, really depressed. The drugs offer him a distraction/relief from that, which is why he does what he does.

Part of me thinks that there's not much I can do. What do you think? Is there something I should do? Or is it better to stay out of it?",academia,"I'm kind of worried about my coworker's drug use, but I'm not sure what I can do that would be actually effective...any ideas?"

A PhD typically takes ~ 5 to 6 years in my department. In my first four years I produced two publications in reputable journals - at least par for the department. In my final year, I decided that rather than do more wet bench experimental work exclusively, I would start teaching myself computer science so that I could try to get a post-doc in a computational biology lab and hit the ground running already knowing some fundamentals of CS. I designed a bioinformatics project for a third paper that was a logical extension of my previous papers and completely makes sense with my thesis topic.

Trouble is, I've had to sacrifice some my of my wet lab productivity for the sake of this new direction. My professor does not understand computers at all, and can't figure out I'm doing this. While I feel like I've made some impressive progress, she has started trashing me, saying my project is a waste of time, and that nobody else in the lab does this kind of thing -- that I'm being arrogant for trying something outside the scope of her lab and wasting the public grant money which funds my salary.

True, the project is not really in her field, and it must be frustrating for her not being able to evaluate its merit or progress. However my goal was to eventually start a collaboration with someone knowledgeable in the field so that this work ultimately results in a paper (good for her, and me), and also give me the skills I want for my next job. My argument is that I've earned the right to take this chance b/c I've already published my quota of papers, and a PhD isn't about pure productivity, but also about setting me with skills for the career I want.

Am I being a jerk by not listening and wasting public money? Any advice? I'm going to GTFO of that lab in ~ about 4 months, but this dispute is starting to be a real problem for my mental health, and I don't really want to sabotage my reference letter. Note: my advisor is generally quite difficult to reason with and constantly has personal difficulties with many people in the lab.",academia,Disobedient PhD student
Seicair,t2_692nw,2015-05-27 03:55:23,37f2iv,1,"I have an associate's in welding technology, and before that I took a year and a half of classes towards computer graphics and web design.  I've worked 7 years in a small manufacturing facility doing welding, CNC work, web design, photography, marketing, and when my manager was out of town, managing the place.  Now I've quit my job and I'm going back to school.  I want to work in pharmaceutical research.  My initial thought was a PharmD, but I'm not sure that's the best degree.

I'm currently fulfilling pre-pharmacy requirements at a local community college, with the intent of transferring to a nearby university. I'm not sure it's the best degree for me, though.  I want to work in pharmaceutical research, developing new drugs.

Areas of research that interest me, in no particular order-

-Life extension, rejuvenation.  Helping people live longer, healthier lives, with the eventual goal of having a 100-year-old with the body of a 30-year-old, or something.

-Regeneration, stem cell treatment.  Regrow lost limbs and organs, teeth, eyes, whatever.  Grow your own organs for transplant, etc.

-Psychedelics and their potential for treating various mental health disorders.  By extension, national drug policy.  Too many politically incorrect substances are illegal for no reason, and they may have medical uses.  Aside from that, perfectly legal recreational drugs are more addictive and physically damaging than many of the illegal/restricted ones.

-Cognitive enhancement, both in regards to maintaining cognitive function long-term, (i.e., fix Alzheimer's and general dementia,) as well as enhancing normal healthy adults.  Also, substances that treat mental disorders like depression and anxiety with fewer side effects or addiction (aside from the illegal psychedelics).

-More generally speaking, I'm interested in refining drugs, minimizing side effects, targeting exactly the desired systems and no more.  Developing more precise treatments.

_____________________________

I'm a year and a half into my pre-pharmacy requirements, and if I don't change anything, would be heading off to pharmacy school in Fall 2016.  I've maintained a 4.0 GPA since going back to school, four semesters so far.  This includes gen chem, organic chem, calc, and several biology courses including anatomy and physiology.  I'm currently working as a chemistry tutor for the college, and got an award from the chemistry department this semester.

So.  What degree would be good?  PharmD?  PhD?  What kind of program should I be looking for?  Where should I be looking?  I'd like to stay in the US.  Michigan, preferably, but I'd be willing to explore other states as well.  A PhD in pharmaceutical sciences, biochem, something else? PharmD with a specialty in clinical pharmacology?

I've heard that whatever my degree, I wouldn't likely be hireable right out of college, that some kind of post-doc fellowship would be necessary to get companies to look at me seriously.  Is that true?  Would there be a difference between a PhD and a PharmD at that point?  What would my educational and career path possibly look like?

How about funding?  Probably not worth taking the SAT/ACT at this point, since my GPA should speak for itself? I've learned that many (most?) PhD students get their tuition paid for and a stipend in exchange for being a TA/research assistant.  Definitely helpful, but I would have to finish a bachelor's first, that funding is most important.  If I go straight to pharmacy school I may or may not need a bachelor's, depending on where I go.

I'd be fine with transferring somewhere to finish a bachelor's, then apply for a PhD program.  Whatever program I end up in, I imagine most or all of my current classes will be applicable, so I'm not in a huge rush, but I need to start making some decisions and figure out where I want to go with my life.  I'm led to believe that the specific bachelor's degree isn't terribly important as long as it's mostly related?  I.e., a bachelor's in organic chem, biochem, pharmaceutical sciences, whatever, would all qualify for a PhD in something I want?

I'm kind of lost and not sure where to find answers, hence the asking several reddit communities.  I've asked some of my professors too, but haven't gotten much direction yet.  Meeting with a couple more this summer, hopefully.",academia,"How do I determine what career I want, and how do I find out the best degree to get for that career?"

I became very depressed and stopped making progress about a year ago. I initially applied for extensions, etc., on account of my mental health, and was granted them. The new due dates came and went, and my mental health was getting worse. I was in such a bad way that I stopped even communicating with my department for about six months. I have now applied for a retrospective leave of absence from the course, which will allow me to make a fresh attempt in January if it is granted.

If the retrospective leave of absence is not granted, I will be exited from the program with the qualification I have earned enough credits for, a Postgraduate Certificate.

There are so many health and safety rules in the workplace that are put in place to guarantee your physical well-being, but none to safeguard your mental well-being.

So many students and postdocs (this probably extends to PIs but I have no first-hand knowledge of this) are either depressed, anxious, have sleep issues, or even suicidal.
