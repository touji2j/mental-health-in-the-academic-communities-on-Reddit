throwawaypassingby01,t2_1cwris90,"Just because someone is good in their field doesn't mean they have good social skills. Some people, especially high achievers, have trouble recognising that just because \*they\* don't or didn't struggle with something, doesn't mean it's not reasonable for others to struggle with that. (Sometimes it's over the top silly. My mom, for example, gets upset at her coworkers wanting a lower weekend workload now that they have kids because she finished her phd as a single mom of two kids under 3.)

In my personal experience, academics as a lot are not exactly the most ""normal"" slice of society, there's an above average number of people with mental health issues like depression, autistic people, eccentrics and obsessives, etc. So like, if you're weird, you fit in.

One professor has decided to make our class HARDER given the circumstances. He’s been super vague about what our grading and evaluation will look like, except for telling us “questions where you have to think.” He hasn’t given us any practice problems or done any review on what he’s going to test on to allow us to properly prepare. He cancelled our second midterm in the course and shifted the weighting of the grades to the final exam, but none of us know what the hell the final will look like; question format, how long we get, what topics will be covered? Is it just the MT 2 topics as we haven’t been tested on that? Or is the whole course cumulative? 

I know for a fact all of my friends in my undergrad are in similar boats as I am. We’re all so stressed out and overwhelmed because we’ve been doing online classes, tons more final projects; as well as moving house back home. There’s been so much change as well as these classes being so important for all our future plans and not knowing where summer research stands, where internships or jobs stand, not knowing how we’re going to pay for tuition next term. And having professors purposely making classes harder is so draining and awful. We’re all in different time zones. Some of us have lost accessibility to mental health services. Some of us know people with COVID-19, or have it ourselves and it’s traumatic and most of my professors acknowledge that we’re all struggling and are making options available and supporting that we’re humans too.

OpulentSassafras,t2_12jv96,"Honestly I feel like I've weathered COVID really well but that's because I had been in therapy for almost a year before. Why was I in therapy you ask? One of my labmates went missing for weeks. I went to his house to try and find him dreading what I might find. He was alive but in a terrible, depressed state. When I got there the police where there but they didn't do anything (labmate isn't white and this is the US so he was very resistant to police ""help""). So I spent hours with him trying to figure out how to get him the help that he needed. I eventually figured something out but it was so overwhelming and, to be honest, a little traumatic. Immediately after figuring out something for my labmate I called student mental health for an appointment me to help me debrief. They couldn't get me in for a while but eventually I got a therapist but that was after I had dealt with the event myself. But I kept going because it was so helpful to instill healthy habits and grad school is stressful.

COVID hit right in the middle of writing my dissertation. I felt so unsupported by my program and school so I was thankful to have an advisor who was awesome through it and an established therapist to help me cope.

Currently too many people suffer from mental health issues but feel like discussing them in the open is a career-ending move, leading to feelings of isolation, exacerbating situation in the individuals, while also masking the size of the problem and resulting in a lack of any serious attempts to address this. 

Systems as large as academia are very resistant to change, so to enact change a critical mass of participants in the system needs to acknowledge these issues as a problem and demand change. That can take a long time, but a starting step is to talk openly about the issues and to educate students (and everyone else) about tools that can help them handle the situations - some good suggestions include meditation/mindfulness and therapy.

This links to thinking with my friend - are people who are pre disposed to mental ill health drawn to academia for some reason? I know I suffered with depression long before my phd. Did the phd make it worse in ways? Hell yes. But a phd also gave me that freedom of schedule and work load to be able to step back and focus on myself in different periods.

I was under very similar circumstances. Alone in the lab with my PI (I was an undergrad at the time). The PI also had a wife who WORKED AS A TECHNICIAN in the lab! And she had a suspicion something was happening. Anyways, he confessed his ""feelings"" for me very similarly to how your PI did. Said he cared about me a lot (this is BULL SHIT -- DO NOT FALL FOR IT LIKE I DID). I was shaken up. Left the lab and just sat on a bench outside to compose myself. Told my boyfriend at the time (we eventually broke up because of this situation) to come see me as soon as he could because I needed to vent. My words were ""my world has completely turned upside down"" and boy it sure did.

Just to provide closure for what happened to me: I ended up getting in a relationship with the professor. I broke up a four-year relationship that was going well for me because I was baited into his remarks. He divorced his wife. We were on and off for two years. I hid it from my parents and pretty much lived a double life, which caused severe emotional trauma.

I struggled through my PhD due to mental health and I most definitely missed opportunities because I wasn't working hard enough. And that's ok. I'm human. I did my best. I've learned from it and continued working and developed better habits and ending up working on great projects where no one gives a shit what I was like during my PhD. 

I'm sure this has come up in your therapy because I ignored it in mine for long enough but it sounds like you expect too much from yourself and you don't take into account that we are not robots and so sometimes things do not go perfectly to plan. Cut yourself some slack, reflect on the ways you've done your best, and look at what things you could put in place to support yourself to do better in the future.",2020-05-12 17:09:22,fqe890o,2,academia
DerProfessor,t2_flltr,"Because we *see* (on a daily basis) students who cannot handle college.  Students who should *not* be paying for an education, because they just do not have the emotional maturity or the intellectual skills. 

**Emotional maturity:**   what do I DO with a student who doesn't show up to class, doesn't read the syllabus, doesn't do the work, doesn't take any responsibility for their education whatsoever??!   

(It's the students who don't put the time in who end up in desperate straits at the end of the semester... it's them, mostly, who cheat/plagiarize, them who beg for exceptions, them who get aggressive and/or threatening.)    Maybe they're getting drunk every night at their frat;  maybe they're stoners;  maybe they have psychological/mental health/health issues (like serious depression, insomnia).  But most of the time, they just cannot make the shift from high school (which is required, and therefore feels like it should be ""resisted"") and college (which is chosen, and therefore should be fully engaged with.)  They are not getting anything out of their education... they are barely aware of it.  But a LOT of people are like this!  If you open up access to college to everyone, you'll just be increasing this group, which will just drag down the rest of the students.   The difference between an intro level course--where, at my university, about 10% of the students fall into this category--and an upper-level course, where 1% fall into it, is stunning.  GOOD students get a lot more out of a class filled with other good students.   They are dragged down by a class filled with absentee, lazy, unmotivated bad students. 

**Intellectual skills:**   this is tougher.   Some people are just not that bright.  Some are bright, but have been screwed by the horrible schools they found themselves shunted off to.   Brilliant students from horrible high schools can catch up.   Average students from horrible high schools cannot catch up.   And if they can't catch up... well, you end up with a problem that is sort-of similar to the one above, namely, the great students--who could get a tremendous amount out of the class--are slowed down by the underprepared students, who need a lot more explained, who need to be caught up on the basics.  I assign challenging writing assignments, that will make good students into excellent writers (and thereby, help to make their future).   But then what do I do with the students who can't understand the assignment?  Who literally cannot master it?  So, should I dial back the assignments--and rob the best students of their *only chance in life* to learn this stuff at this level???!   Or should I try to teach two versions of the class simultaneously--one advanced, one remedial?  Should there be different ""tracks"" in college, just like there are in many public high schools?   This is a really thorny problem... one not made any easier by many peoples' simplifications... ""we need to increase access!""   Sure, but bringing students who can't write into classes where advanced writing is required is just going to result in 1)  a lot of students failing, or 2)  a lot of advanced students, ready for serious writing, finding themselves stuck in a class where they are basically paying to repeat high school. 

The ""worry about graduation rates"" issue is really a worry of administrators.  There are reasons *aside* from the two above that many students don't graduate, and those can be (and need to be) grappled with effectively.  But the two above are pretty damn intractable, as much as we all would desire otherwise.",2020-05-09 14:21:24,fq0lz8j,1,academia
unscientist,t2_52os1,"I know everyone is going to say that it's normal to feel that way, and it's true. A big number of students feel crossing anxiety and depression at the end. I know I did. But if I remember correctly, I always thought ""if I were to get hot by a car or if I took a bullet for someone, at least I wouldn't have the burden of living the rest of my life"". I never connected it specifically to my work in lab (not that my thoughts were any better).

I was so burnt out by the time I graduated. I forced my graduation after 7 years and by that time, I had 2 weeks to write my dissertation. The stress was crushing me to a point where I would have constant panic attacks, and I didn't even know what panic attacks were. I had convinced myself I was finished with working in a lab, but there was no time to find a new job. The easiest thing was to just get a postdoc... So I did.

It's one of the best things I've done. I switched fields. I got a project I loved. I got to develop a project I love. But when it all falls down to it again... When I'm not making progress and not working up to my standard, the darkness just creeps back in ever so slowly. 

Mental health is so important. If you're not happy, what's the use of everything? If it's the work itself that makes your skin crawl, find something else. Working at the bench is definitely not your only skill. You are trained in critical thinking, problem solving, you probably work well with others, can adapt to changing situations, can follow and optimize a process... So many things. Don't sell yourself short.

If it's the project that makes you unhappy, maybe give a year's postdoc a try. When I was hesitant to make the jump into my postdoc, my advisor's advice to me was that ""it's just a job"". You can always quit if you don't like it. Who cares? If you don't stay in academia after that, you're not burning any bridges. Just be honest about why you've made your decision.

I'd have a talk with your advisor. If you feel comfortable, share your struggles with him/her. It's important that you get on a similar page (if not the same) so that he/she can understand why you may not be delivering at the quality or rate you used to in the past.

I feel like this is getting a bit long. Feel free to chat with me any time. Just send a message. I'm very open to my postdoc peers and grad students I know about my mental health struggles, and I'm grateful to have a mentor that understands when I'm having an off day.

Am also aiming at a public health position right now because i cant stand the idea of science anymore but do hope that will return in the future. Very comforting, so a great answer.

Dr_TLP,t2_42wr163i,"I wouldn’t dwell on it, just learn from the situation and move on. I’d recommend seeing a therapist and career counselor as you figure out the next stage of your life. To mend your relationship, I would probably wait a few days, casually apologize to them, in person ideally (eg, I am sorry I was stressed the other day, I appreciate the time and effort you have taken with me and I am looking forward to continuing working with you). Then from that point on, I would keep the conversations very professional. Time will fix this transgression (and we have all made some along the way!). Every interaction with this professor would ideally keep in mind/assume that this person will be writing you a letter of recommendation and you want them to attest to your professionalism. So, it’s fine to ask them what graduate school is like more generally; if program a or program b would be a better fit if your research interest is xyz; if they could give you advice on what sort of job to seek next to set yourself up for success; if they could connect you to anyone they know who does xyz research, and so on. For me, in this sort of situation, boundary crossing would be revealing too many details about mental health, low key insulting their profession/career choice (eg insunuating you want MORE than their position, not just different), pushing them too hard on details about graduate school (some things would be more appropriate to ask current grad students, for example).",2020-08-11 01:51:51,g124ij8,1,academia
MBarbs2197,t2_6qhe7akd,"Hi, I'm not psychiatrist nor psychologist, and my advice certainly won't be the best, but I will try to share my experience in the best possible way that I can. 

To put you in context, I was also undergoing some serious trouble with anxiety and depression, since I have memory, but got really intensified during my first year of undergrad. I won't go through the details but things got really fucked up, I was throwing away my whole life through self-destructive behaviors and getting involved in toxic relationships. However, I feel identified with you in the fact that, although I couldn't feel any excitement or meaningfulness in anything that I did, I could still figure out some ""potential"" passion regarding my studies. 

First off, I wouldn't rely solely on antidepressants. Any kind of external help is limited (and maybe even useless) if you don't put the effort amd attention on working on yourself. I visited psychiatrists, psychologist and seeked for any possible kind of help. I had a period of 5 months sort of getting better , but when I was back in the wrong way, I wasn't gradually getting worse again, I picked it up exactly where I left off, and that was by far the worst time in my life, and you certainly don't want to be in that place (if you aren't yet). This happended to me for not putting absolutely any effort on repairing myself. However, professional advice can be very valueble, just try and see what works for you. So here's my little piece of advice (what worked for me):

1. Embrace the fact that this can be a life lasting chronic illness, and you will need to work on it daily for the rest of your life. The moment you relax can easily put you back we're you started. 

2. Take care of your physical health. I don't know exactly why, or if there is any kind of academic evidence, but you will certainly feel better much more easily if your health isn't a holly mess. Try developing well settled sleeping, dieting and sport habits, being as intentional as you possibly can with them. Also be sure to  get enough sunlight.

3. SMILE UNTIL IT HURTS. This was definitely the first big step to getting better and should've been the first one. . This built up possitive momentum (and who knows, maybe even altering my brains neurochemistry) and was certainly essential giving me the force I needed to get out of the shitty place I found myself in.

4. Work consistently on developing a spirituality. Like I mean meditation and that kind of mindfulness practices, but also getting to build a relationship with the idea of a ""greater power"" or ""God"" or however you want to call it. Get rid of any intellectual impediments, it's not a matter of believing because it's true, but rather because it's useful. Developing a deep relationship with this idea was critical to feel safe in the world I live in. Know I'm always sure that whatever happens, it is always for the better, and most importantly, that I'm never alone. 

5. This also means working on certain values such as ACCEPTANCE, GOOD WILL, RECEPTIVITY, HONESTY and HUMILITY. I found those extremely important on building up my spirituality. The most critical part of it is to act them out. 

6. Be intentional with your relationships. Work patiently on building up deep and meaningful relationships with family, friends, and maybe a romantic partner if you're prepared for it. Be very careful with toxic relationships, as they can screw up all progress (not like blaming on other people, but sometimes it is inevitable or, rather difficult to avoid, the fact that certain personalities or people bring us back to our old patterns of thinking, just be careful, intentional and patient about whom you want before you on life). 

7. Be careful and intentional with the way you speak. If I was to say and repeat, ""what a terrible day"", I would be terribly miserable even if I won the lottery. On the other hand, just the fact that I was saying the contrary, using positive and constructive ways of speaking and not ranting everytime about how much I hated everything, would make it much easier for my to deal with any problem that could've come out during the day.

8. READ a lot. As a child, I remember I had always hated reading. However, it was the only thing that could maintain me sufficiently entertained and concentrated to distract me from my destructive thoughts. Plus, there is great value on reading, whereas it's learning new stuff with non-fiction books, or just fulfilling yourself with stories that you love. From what I've read since the day I started putting myself together, I can strongly recommend 'Factfulness' from Hans Rosslind (uplifting narrative and facts), '12 rules for life' from Jordan B. Peterson (and strongly recommend every piece of content he publishes on this regard, regardless of your opinion on his controversial political opinions, he has invaluable advice for people like us and seems to me that he's on the same boat), 'Les miserables', Victor Hugo (Again, uplifting, and extremely beautiful story of invaluable worth, this was by far my favourite and best book I EVER ever read, strongly recommend); 'Man's search for meaning', Viktor Frankl ( this guy survived 5 concentration camps and still managed to pass away with head over his shoulders, must know better than anyone, again very useful advice). 

9. Develop a passion. I found out that passion isn't held within, it is rather developed, same as interests. This sums up when coming to meaningfulness and fulfillment. Personally, as you can figure out, the passions I developed to the date are basically reading and my studies. 

10. Be kind and loving to yourself. I mean, if you know you're trying your damn best to improve your attitude and behaviour, let yourself to take a deep breath and keep pushing forward. Anybody is perfect and less when things are starting to roll, so don't be extremely harsh or self-destructing (I know, it sounds easy to say, but really try, it's possible and very helpful even if it's for a moment). 

10. However, try to know yourself as you really are, not how you think you are. This helps to notice things you can change when things stop improving. Be realistic about your actions and focus enough on what's keeping you back until it improves again. Trying to figure out how you managed to end up in such a compliicated circumstance might give some insights on where to start.

Anything regarding the work issues, I think you were given very good advice. Brake down everything into bite sized chunks (including all the above stated) and just write, there will be time for edition and perfectionism later on. 

After 1 year and 7 months, my life's in decent order again. I have a meaningful romantic relationship, I'm doing fairly decently academically and I'm working on building and repairing some fucked up friendships and family relationships. It's far from perfect but it gets better every day. Plus, I don't take any kind of medication regarding my mental health anymore, and I feel that works awesomely for me (however as I tried to explain before, that is up to professional advice, all this rant was only trying to say ""hey, you can also try this, maybe before, or maybe while you take ADs, but don't let yourself not to take care on you, as I certainly didn't do while expecting that some magical pill would safe my life) I know that every person is different and we each undergo such complicated illnesses our own ways, but I think this is the best advice I can give you. Basically, don't wait for the help to arrive, for anyone to rescue. Secure yourself by working hardly on it and who knows, it might work, but people die from this shit, and it's definitely worth trying. I hope you the best and feel free to contact (if possible) whenever. For anyone else, if you found this useful, please share, if you found it bullshit, please say. It's just the best piece of advice I can give you based on my own personal experience, and it might not work for you, but I really hope it does. And excuse my terrible english, I hope I could make myself clear enough. Good luck!

AlterEgoofaCreep,t2_3ot6qsfb,"hey ! this sounds exactly like the situation i found myself in few months back. it took every ounce of my strength to make myself sit down and actually write something. what really helped me was the pomodoro method. 

i would trick myself into thinking that i am just going to be studyin for 40 mins straight. i set my timer for 40 mins and by the time my alarm rang i was too immersed in the content to think about my deadline. eventually the time started to go up and my anxiety lowered significantly due to the fact that i was actually doing something about it and was not spending my time worrying. 

this might not work for everyone but it really helped me coax my mind to sit and start doing the actual work. 

&amp;#x200B;

also during those days, i would get easily distracted, say by instagram or tv series, and i would then tell myself, ""once i finish writing this chapter, i am going to buy myself this"" or ""once i finish writing this topic, i am going to watch an episode"". i know it sounds childish but it worked. 

once you complete your thesis, you can work on your mental health more effectively. the key is not to let the mind trick you into panicking and making it focus on solving the immediate problem at hand rather than letting it wonder about the bigger picture.

I walk my dog everyday and I make sure to have a podcast to listen to while I walk. Is there somewhere you can go to walk, while you have an audio book or something to take your mind off things? Make it a daily goal if you can. 

I also take an SSRI and I hope to start therapy soon (not so easy as I live in a country where I don't speak the language).

pillowsthrowsandsuch,t2_3qqs8v7p,"I'm a very different field in academia, nearing the end of PhD. I often wonder if I should have dropped out when I had my first inklings about how uncertain a career in academia is. I've decided that I'm too close to the end to drop out now but if I could go back in time, I don't think I'd choose this path again. I absolutely love teaching university classes and I'm actually pretty good at it but there are other things I want in life that require a more stable income. I say this because a quick scan of the other comments about following your dreams and passion are probably equally as valid but, as someone who's in the thick of it, they don't seem to account for the daily stress I experience about an uncertain financial future. I don't have the same familiar pressures you have; what I do have is an upbringing in a poverty and a single parent that I want to help care for (financially), especially given all the sacrifices that she made for me. So I guess this part of my comment is just to say that at least to some extent, I hear you, I feel you.   


On a more practical note, there is organization called Beyond the Professoriate that helps academics transition into non-academic careers. I've started attending their free online workshops and have book-marked them as a source for some paid career coaching when I'm closer to finished. It might be worthwhile to look into the services they offer because maybe there is a way for you to pursuit your passions and study all the fascinating things you're curious about, with a post-school plan that reworks your passions into something that provides the financial security you want.

I have a few times been in meeting or at dinner where a couple of bitter long-term postdocs will bring up the lack of career chances and all the professors go completely silent.

1) it's unethical and flies in the face of working scientifically, which is what the PhD is 

2) you can't falsify data well, you will make it fit some hypothesis (most likely yours)

3) you don't have data to draw conclusions from and may hence end up drawing conclusions that would be easy to dismiss given the data (or for peers and seniors such as the PhD committee) 

4) the chance of being caught is not small (and you may be caught in all perpetuity)

She is not alone in struggling. It's not uncommon to have serious motivation and mental health issues during your dissertation, and this is amplified by corona.

DocMondegreen,t2_wnbu1,"This does not sound like an atmosphere conducive to sharing info about depression. I'd normally suggest sharing to help lessen the stigma, yadda yadda, but that is just not valid for everyone. 

What I would do instead: work on prioritizing your work. Talk to your PI about how you can accomplish x and y, but not z, unless he wants you to do z, in which case you'll push back y. Set your own reasonable deadlines, and if you take the lead, you might be able to convince everyone that these were their idea. Proactively request formal check-ins from coworkers on certain dates/intervals so they're not always ambushing you about work. Talk about how the pandemic and the practical limitations on the lab/research are affecting you and your research (since it seems your PI is not open to discussing emotional distress). Is it harder to get interlibrary loan? Does your home computer just take longer to run regressions? idk- whatever sounds reasonable but *tangible*. Plus, you can't just work 20 hours a day because you need to start work on the next round of applications, too, and could the PI find a moment to review your research statement? They should also be supportive of your continued job search (and gently remind them of this if they push back). 

Also, if there are pay problems, go above their heads and get that fixed! Talk to HR, payroll, bursar, ombuds, whoever. It should not roll back on you unless someone in your lab is messing up the paperwork. Of course, if you absolutely cannot get it fixed, you might have to contact the labor board, which may or may not have repercussions for you. I somehow suspect that financials may have affected your mental state.

Finally, are you taking care of your mental health? Online and tele health services have expanded a ton, and many universities have done so, too. Keep in contact with your non-local friends.

If you get sick, you have healthcare through your employer. Are you a US citizen? If so, you have not had to bend over backwards to obtain a visa in these times, with ICE threatening to take your TT job away from you and send you packing in a pandemic. Is your writing constantly being interrupted by childcare duties? Etc. The circumstances are dark indeed, and I don't know your story, but from what I can tell you're sitting on top of the hill here.

Now we're often asked during zoom talks how we are doing, but seeing as we're all in a group call everyone sort of just mumbles that they're doing alright. We've been reminded about the university services. However, I have not used the services offered at my current university.

wirrbeltier,t2_6cvqbsaw,"Biology PhD from the Netherlands here. In our group/department, we have a mentoring program, ombudspeople for conflict resolution, and several offices for grad student progress monitoring. Offers for mental health / resiliency training are ubiquitous, e.g. participating in personal coaching sessions. I did one in a previous project and it did help (also I dropped that project afterwards, but that's a different story). Of course pressure is high in general, but there usually are at least people you can talk to. 

Thus, there are offers, but the onus is on the PhD to make contact. I personally am okay with this setup, but if someone is seriously depressed it could be hard for them to make this move. Treatment for depression is something that is taken care of in the general health system, as far as I know there are no special mental-health professionals available for PhD students. 

As for the lockdown, at least in my direct environment it's been handled quite well. The department/institute has been relatively responsive and communicative, with weekly update letters and online discussion sessions between PhD student representatives and the admin top brass every month or so. It does help that most PhD positions are funded fully for a fixed 4 years in advance, and that we are treated as proper employees with benefits instead of students. We have had soft announcements from admin that extensions would be discussed on a case-by-case basis. The grant funding agencies are currently discussing whether they will grant extensions, but I doubt it will happen. The Universities as a whole are not as dependent on tuition as in the US/UK, so as far as I can see there is no looming higher-ed enrolment apocalypse coming. 

My department and PI have actually been supportive throughout the lockdown, mostly through relaxed performance requirements and upbeat messages. We have all been asked to make the best of our time, and so far almost everyone has been able to find something to do. The lockdown is being relaxed gradually, and I guess until a second wave hits people will gradually restart labwork and try to get things done as quickly as possible. The real damage will probably be structurally over the coming years, when the economic downturn bites and government funding dries up.",2020-07-08 22:01:32,fxcykzp,1,academia

polyphonal,t2_bvkqt,"I'm no in your field so the writing process will be a bit different, but 7 months is plenty of time to write a PhD thesis in my field, especially for someone who's already written two papers.  I think you'll be okay. 

A few pointers, then:

* Write a detailed outline of the thesis and get it out to your PI and whoever else you need to asap.  Get feedback on it from a few other people if you can.  Your detailed timeline is a great idea, definitely do that.

* It will get busy and frantic, and when things get that way it can be easy to feel like you can't afford the time to take a step back to re-plan and consider the big picture.  This is a false economy: when deadlines are tight, you can't afford to *not* do things correctly the first time.  So set some time aside very regularly (weekly?) to look back over your thesis plan, evaluate your progress, and make the changes you need to make to get this done.  

* Get all your tools in place.  Make sure you're comfortable with whatever bits of software you need (your reference manager, or styles/template tools in your writing software, for example).  

* Keep a running and thorough list of all the small jobs that need to be done on the thesis, even really small jobs.  Personally I found this really useful because any time that I was having trouble starting to write, I'd instead just knock off a few of these easy minor things and that would help. 

* Make sure you know how you work most efficiently, and make that environment/schedule happen as much as you can under the circumstances.  It's far better (for your thesis and your mental health) to spend a few hours efficiently than many hours inefficiently.  

* Remember: not only is it impossible to write the perfect thesis, but doing so would be an incredible waste of time.  Your thesis should be good enough to comfortably pass the requirements, and no better.  Expend any extra time and energy on writing papers, applying for jobs, or doing non-work things.",2020-09-19 08:34:31,g5spc0e,4,academia

So academics throw these pity parties all day long. And then if that wasn't enough, we play victim and pretend as if these pity parties are 'unpopular' when in reality, they are the fuel that drive academics' self-hatred.

And then ONE person, like me (the asshole) calls you out on it... and ohhhh boy the pity party just got the equivalent of a pity keg.

Do I think its the 'culture' that makes some academics have meltdowns? No. At least not any more than if the same person worked in any other profession (hence the dispositional nature of mental health problems).

Do I think academics are all 'dispositionaly neurotic'? C'mon, of course people differ. But those that complain the most, are some of the most neurotic. Like I said, go get help.

Being able to learn topic through self-study sounds quite smart. Like, you were able to learn new skills not because a course demanded it and explained it in detail but through self-motivation and by digging into it until you had it figured out.

For your mental health, don't be shy to seek help if you feel that you might benefit from it, it's likely your University has offers to get you started.

Some institutions realize that they can only continue to attract good students/postdocs if their students/postdocs have good job placement afterwards. I think this philosophy helps counter the structural issues in the relationships and can produce really healthy environments. So seek out places like this.

Lastly, re mental health and weakness, your perception is not universal.

To start with that: Some PIs are batshit crazy and you should run while you can. A PhD isn't always worth keeping up with their crazyness and destroying your mental health. Sometimes cutting your losses and leaving is indeed the better choice, even if it's hard since it'll obviously halt your career for a bit. But your career isn't worth destroying yourself over.  

But your PI is still your boss and expects something in return for welcoming you in their lab.  
How much they can demand depends on the nature of your employment (e.g. my contract outright stated how much work time was reserved for my PhD and how much unrelated work could be expected from me). You also shouldn't forget to evaluate not only the direct benefit you gain from complying but also the possible negative influence if you refuse. With that I don't mean ""Do whatever your crazy PI demands"" but especially if it's a task that can quickly be done and that needs to by done (not like others will be more eager) it can be easier to just do it and not burn bridges with your PI (who basically holds your degree hostage) by refusing or wasting everyones time by trying to argue about it when it anyways needs to be done...

Schiaparelli,t2_8a5z9,"Have you worked a full-time job before, or seriously looked into potential industry jobs that resonate with your intellectual interests?

I ask because the impression I get from your post is that doing a PhD and becoming a professor in your areas of interest is not just _a_ dream, it’s  _the_ dream. And because of that, you’re trying hard to convince yourself (and get affirmation from this community) that it’s worth pursuing this dream, even though getting a tenure-track professorship is intensely competitive.

I’m not here to lecture you about how grad school in the humanities is pointless, and that you should prioritise employability and earning potential above all else. I did my bachelor’s in a STEM program and I’m now doing an MA in a history subfield I’m passionate about, so I do understand how incredibly meaningful it is to get to pursue your passions.

But! If you see academia as the _only_ dream and the _only_ path you can be excited by: I would strongly, strongly urge you to expand your horizons and develop a more nuanced view of what’s possible in a non-academic life. There _are_ jobs where you can work with interesting, kind people who will expand your intellectual horizons and shape (and even change) your world view. There *are* jobs where you can teach others and be deeply energized by mentoring and encouraging others (which is what I got to experience before I began my MA!). I want to emphasize this because a lot of posts on r/gradschool seem to be written by current undergrads/fresh graduates who think that their _only_ choices are ‘pursue my grad school dream, live my best intellectual life, but maybe be unemployed’ or ‘resign myself to the late-capitalist horrors of industry and always long for what could have been’. If this isn’t you, apologies for assuming. But if it is…

I’d recommend *seriously* considering what a non-academic life looks like, one that you could enjoy and even thrive in. This is not to say you should give up on your grad school dreams! You could live this non-academic life for a few years, save up money, develop new skills, and be a more competitive applicant to a grad school program later on. You could do an MA and then decide that a PhD isn’t for you, and then begin your non-academic life. You could do a PhD and then choose an alt-ac career. You could do a PhD and apply for tenure-track roles and pursue your dream of being a professor, knowing that—if you can’t land a highly competitive position—you can still look for an intellectually fulfilling and rewarding job elsewhere.

In my case, I worked for a few years between my bachelor’s and MA and it’s made my MA experience so much better. I’m still considering doing a PhD and, like you, have dreams of teaching. But the academic job market in my field(s) of interest is seriously bad—likely similar to what yours would be in English/theology—and it’s not just about getting the job after the PhD, it’s all the sacrifices that happen during the PhD. Numerous people in this thread have already detailed the financial, emotional, and mental toll of it.

If you can give yourself options—and give yourself the mental space to get excited about other paths—you’ll be much better equipped for whatever path you end up taking. **Even if you end up going to grad school after all.** It’s good for your mental health to be able to envision a life outside academia (especially if employment stats in your field get you down).

polyphonal,t2_bvkqt,"The anxiety may benefit from some therapy/counselling - if it feels like that's the way to move forward, go for it.  The only other way I know of is to develop confidence in your abilities and outputs.  I'm going to only address that second option, because I'm not qualified to discuss the first.  So the question is how to do more/better work, and how to feel better about what you're doing.

I agree with the other commenter: break your work down into clear, well-defined tasks so you see yourself actually making progress and know where you're going.

More broadly, remember that increasing your efficiency is a far better strategy than increasing your hours. I'd suggest that now (and regularly) you step back to take a hard, clinical look at how you use your time and evaluate what environment or tools make you more productive. I know it can be hard to do when you feel behind and overwhelmed, but that's exactly when it's most needed.  After alll, you're better off spending 6 hours working at high efficiency than 10 hours working at half efficiency. Not only will you get more done, but your mental health will be much better. Be proactive about experimenting with how to increase your efficiency.

It's important that you take regular breaks, limit your hours to something sustainable, and have healthy, diverse hobbies/friendships.  This is not a sign of weakness; it will benefit your work as well as your overall wellbeing.  On the other side, though, it's also important to be use your breaks to do something that actually refreshes you, whatever that is. Design your breaks to make you feel genuinely rested or happy and able to get back to whatever you need to do, not just to procrastinate or wallow. 

Lastly, every time you start a new task, first estimate how long you'll need for that task. When you finish the task, go back and check how bad your estimate was.  This is going to be a painful exercise at first - most people are terrible at this.  However, once you get better at estimating how long things take you, you'll get better at planning out your time and you'll feel more in control of your schedule and outputs.",2020-12-09 09:57:35,gf5kchv,1,academia

Especially because it sounds like this class really has you stressed. It's ok, sometimes it happens.

If you withdraw from the course, it will definitely affect your GPA because the credits attempted will still count, but you're not earning those credits. If you've never dropped a course and are above the minimum GPA requirement for your fin aid and scholarships, you should safely be able to drop the course. 

That being said, reach out to your fin aid office to ask if dropping this course will negatively affect your aid, bc I don't know what your award, tuition, need, etc, looks like. Also, if you drop a class too early in the semester, you will be required to repay that financial aid back to the college.

If you are unable to withdraw from this class, find out if you can receive tutoring services. I haven't heard of a college that doesn't offer free tutoring. Finally, look into whether your school has a grade replacement policy. If you can't drop, and tutoring doesn't help, retake the class (with a different prof, if possible), and file a grade replacement form.

After completing prelims, a prospectus, and a substantial amount of research, I found myself in a *really* dark depressed state for innumerable reasons, most of which were opaque to me at the time but were in fact related to academic culture and a larger sense of dissatisfaction with how academia and scholarly culture operates (socially, economically, politically, etc). And one day I was brooding yet again, wishing I could walk away from the whole thing, when I suddenly realized that I *could* walk away, that there was literally nothing that could stop me from walking away if that's what I chose to do. And it sounds like an exaggeration/cliche, but as I stayed with that thought for a minute and explored it, it felt like my body got ten times lighter and a sort of clarity emerged. I knew I had big decisions to make but just the recognition of that - that I could walk away and the sky wouldn't fall, the world wouldn't fall apart, etc - it opened up a whole world of options.

For me, the biggest positive change was distancing myself from the source of negativity, which I know is difficult since you have to work together.  My suggestion in finding students/post-docs/professors in your field that you can approach with day-to-day or general questions can help you limit your contact with this postdoc and only see her when necessary to discuss specifics of your work. (Of course, you should not avoid this postdoc to the point where your work progress is affected.)

I would still try to talk to your PI. If you tread carefully in how you word your frustrations, I don't think you will necessarily come off as a ""tattle tale"". Moreover, I don't think you will be sabotaging this post-doc since she is doing that to herself by behaving the way she does. I agree with the other response that you could frame the conversation in terms of a check-in/review to make sure you're on track and meeting your PI's expectations (our department mandates these semesterly, so this shouldn't be uncommon/weird). You can ask your PI about her expectations in terms of your ability to write papers/proposals, your level of understanding on certain topics, or how independent your PI expects you to be at this stage in grad school, etc. It would probably come up naturally that your postdoc seems to have unrealistic expectations for you and you can discuss her behavior in that context.

Additionally, most universities have mental health services that are free/low-cost to students.

PurrPrinThom,t2_6t2ba,"Do you have any letters/notes from professor, your therapists etc? I think those would go a long way to helping your case.

I also don't know about how formal this process is at your university, but I think some aspects of your petition here - while I understand they are true and likely difficult to talk about - are a little too informal in my personal opinion, and at some points are somewhat emotionally charged. I think it would be more beneficial to stick strictly to facts, and I think you could do with some significant rewriting.

I don't think you need to go into such great detail about the conflicts with your family. I think summarising it succinctly might work better, because at the moment the bulk of your petition focuses on what went wrong and your steps to improve your situation are overshadowed. Your focus is proving you are capable of continuing next year, and figuring out if you've overcome to obstacles that impeded you this year is going to be the committee's main priority. At the moment, the focus is on your past problems, and while I understand why you've done that, that's not what the committee will be looking for. They're not evaluating who had it bad enough to merit a second chance, they're looking for who is capable of returning to university in a better place - if that makes sense. 

So, for example, the section beginning with ""To begin, I need to describe what the root cause of my downfall this year has been. "" and ending with ""urs before an evaluation, completely stressed out even though I had practiced weeks in advance and knew the content"" can be better summarised. ""Downfall"" is, in my opinion, one of the examples of phrasing that is  too emotionally charged, too dramatic. Instead I would remove all of that sort of detail and instead say something like:

&gt;For the 2018-2019 academic year I was living with my mother who has a severe form of paranoid schizophrenia. In addition to having to handle her other paranoid delusions, my mother frequently behaved this past academic year in a way that was detrimental to my learning and my ability to perform successfully in my courses, such as restricting my ability to attend evening lectures and confiscating my electronics, including my laptop on which I complete all of my homework. 

&gt;The stress of having to live with and manage these behaviours caused my own mental health to suffer, and despite my best efforts, my performance in my classes was negatively affected. 

Then I would go on to detail the steps you've taken to better your situation: you're seeing someone at CAMH, you've moved out. I would keep the bit about how you regret not getting help sooner (though honestly I'd probably cut ""I tried to reach out to CAMH multiple times however, the sheer ignorance and lack of understanding about mental health and the stigma revolving around it bested me. Plus, I tried going there in February &amp; March a couple of times, however I came back dissuaded because of the long wait times at the emergency services. "" because it isn't really relevant - you didn't get the help because you were in denial, that sums it up well enough) as it shows you've learned from your mistakes and can now move forward. 

I would also cut that you have been ""traumatised"" by Math, CS &amp; Stats - as again, too emotionally charged. But I would say that having audited these classes during this past year you have a new direction that you're more excited about, and you're keen to take a new step forward with a new program now that you've gotten the help and made the necessary changes that have resolved the problems you had last year.",2019-06-29 20:42:38,escwr63,4,academia
phryna,t2_sce4k,"I'm a tenure track professor who advises PhD students. I'm hoping to give some constructive criticism - all I know about you is this post and there are many things about who you are, your capacity as a person and student that I can't possibly know and thus this advice is unidimensional. 

There are a lot of red flags for me as an advisor in your post that would make me very reticent to accept you into a PhD program. 

My advice would be to go out and get a job, and if you still want to pursue a PhD in a couple of years, go for it. It will still be there. The reason I say this is manifold:

1) It seems like you should work on some mental health issues before delving into a stressful and demanding environment - I do not mean to be condescending in this - I personally take sertraline for anxiety. But you need to establish a controllable baseline before entering a program if you want to come out the other end healthy, 

2) You need to really, really know you want or need a PhD to get where you're going. My program is biomedical - 75% of our incoming PhD students express a desire to gain a tenure track job. Our completion rate is \~50%, and of our graduates, around 15% gain TT positions within 5 years of graduation. I'm not sure on the stats specific to psychology PhD programs, but I can't imagine they are horribly different. 

Furthermore, studies have shown that the shortfall in earnings from not having earned money during PhD are not made up for by increased promotion in industry, and having a PhD can impede success in the job market for entry level industry jobs. 

The numbers say you probably won't get a job as a professor, and the PhD might well hurt your chances of employment post graduation. So absolutely don't do it unless you're sure - it could well end up being a dumb hat, bit of paper and half a decade's worth of resentment if you aren't crystal clear on why you're there. 

3) A PhD is much more akin to an entry level professional traineeship (e.g. cadetship in a law firm, residency in med school) than a continuation of undergraduate studies. The workload, required professionalism, expectations of productivity are often a critical, unsurpassable shock to people coming straight from undergrad with poorly matched expectations. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I would go get a job, earn some money, gain some workplace experience. Know what you are giving up to go to grad school and if you still want to do it after a couple of years, you will be better prepared financially, mentally and experience-wise to succeed. Best of luck.",2019-06-24 12:39:33,erxbn5r,4,academia
v_jade,t2_yr4kp7k,"I've been working on this for about two years now. For a little more than a year I worked on it alone. During this time I discovered the novel phenomena that is the basis of the paper. Then, the postdoc joined the group and started out helping me. Since my project was working it was a good way to introduce him to the lab since I could teach him about all the experimental process involved in fabricating and measuring a working device. After I taught him these things he stayed around on the project because we work well together and I was happy to have him.

He has given a lot of effort to this. I would say one of the most substantial things was there was a period of several months over which we were measuring nonstop and someone had to have an eye on the experiment at all times. So I volunteered to do the night shift and watched it for 12 hours at night and he did the one in the daytime. He also helped with other things like some simulations of the data. I'm very happy to have him as second author.

After reflection I realized that all of these things--that I made the discovery before he was there, that I worked on it for over a year longer than he did and even in the last year it was my sole focus while he also did other things-- this made me believe that authorship in this situation shouldn't even be a question. I have a hard time standing up for myself and generally don't think well of myself a lot of the time, so I think that's why it took me a while to see it for what it is.

And that's why I'm a bit upset with my advisor. I can't believe he'd make me doubt myself so much over this, especially since he knows about my mental health issues. I'm not sure if I'm totally off base here, but my impression was: He's a young Prof up for tenure soon. The kind of jobs his postdoc gets will influence his image especially in this earlier stage of his professorship. So perhaps that's why he wanted to stretch the  authorship in this work.

In a typical semester, 2-3 days a week I get to campus about 9:30am and teach an early and a mid-morning class. I meet with students/research assistants, and/or go to useless meetings (service) for a couple hours, then teach a late afternoon class before I leave campus. I like to take a little time for me (go to yoga, run errands, cook dinner) and then in the evenings after I get home I catch up on grading and/or lecture prep and/or email for a couple hours.

Some of what I do is total bullshit (I've sat in an hour long meeting about changing to LED lightbulbs our office lamps) which eats into time I'd rather be doing other things, but I think all jobs have some of that. I try to grade and prep lectures between things (or occasionally during things) and sometimes manage to carve out 2-3 hours for research these days when I have an active project/deadline. 

At least one day a week I try to work from home. I try to save 3 hours these mornings for research and/or conference calls with collaborators. In the afternoons I prep lectures, grade papers, and deal with email backlogs. Sometimes I cut out early these days and hang with loved ones, but sometimes I work until much later than I should. 

During busy times in the semester I certainly work longer hours (get up at 6 to get a lecture prepped or spend 20 hours of my weekend grading), but those balance out with weeks where the workload is lighter. I'd say I average about 45 hours a week during the semester, but they can range from 25-70. One huge perk is that things are flexible, for example I tend to take part of every Friday off to spend time with friends/family or work around the house, but I also generally save about 4 hours on Sunday afternoon/evening to get ready for Monday morning.

I know some people in similar positions who work A LOT more than this, but after running myself ragged in graduate school I decided that it was more important to me to find a position that offers me some balance rather than a more prestigious one. I'll never be a famous big-name researcher but I've got a great relationship with my partner, I see my family and friends lot, and I make time for my hobbies. Basically, I'm here to say that an academic career can be a really, really wonderful thing if you find the right niche for yourself. Don't let other people tell you what type of job you ""should"" have or ""can"" have--- search for something that feels right to you and plays to your strengths and the lifestyle you want. Being a professor and mentor is one of the most rewarding things I've ever done and I haven't had to sacrifice my mental and physical health to do it.",2019-08-09 00:56:40,ewe1cn7,1,academia

I'm interested in how this conversation went that you don't feel comfortable applying to a new job with their knowledge. I don't see how applying to a new lab would be much different than applying to a different department or institution altogether. Funding in academia is often soft and this may be a suggestion for them to allow you to get out before it dries up?

That said, egos in academia can be ridiculous and you know the PI better than we do. Do you feel like they are proprietary or would get angry if you switched out for a sure deal instead of a wishy-washy offer?",2019-07-23 16:29:06,eulbo21,9,academia

sophie_the_turtle,t2_n5ehe,"u/lucianbelew is correct; I will add a few things from my own experience. 

I thought the PhD was not terribly hard--I had moments of suffering and mental health issues, but they mostly stemmed from things unrelated to the program. 

What destroyed me was the job market, working full-time in academia, and seeing how people are treated. The job market is a crap shoot that will make most people doubt their own value and question themselves about every single aspect of their personality and intellect. I would say I am psychologically more fragile than many, and it seriously pushed me close to the edge many times. 

In my first job (VAP), I was harassed sexually by a colleague and psychologically by my department chair. I was depressed that entire year. At my current job, none in my department is insane, but the administration is absolutely s\*\*\*ty and morally abusive (eg. I have many colleagues who have resigned because they were bullied in their departments and the administration was just: ""oh, nothing we can do"". This is super disheartening). Also, as long as you don't have tenure, you are basically at the mercy of everyone (students, colleagues, administrators). Are they yelling at you all the time? No, but they wield a tremendous amount of power over you. 

I am in a TT job now, and going up for tenure next year. It looks like I would get it, but at this point I am so sick with all of this that I am debating going through with it. 

As u/lucianbelew pointed out, there are many sociopaths and narcissists in academia, arguably more in academia than in industry because once they have tenure, they stay put and can continue being absolute a\*\*holes in impunity.",2019-08-19 16:00:09,exf1e41,1,academia

I'm sure people in, say, cancer research and similar fields find the work sad and overwhelming at times too, but there's an extra fuck-you aspect when the ""problem"" is people being terrible, and also it's all over the media.

Contributing to these fields is important and absolutely worth it in the abstract, but you have to figure out if *you're* the right person to do it. If you'd struggle with self-care, would have problems with boundaries, or feel like the weight of the topic would be detrimental to your mental health, then it probably is not a good idea.

None of my friends/family could relate or understand why I was feeling this way. There were so many expectations to be first in the family to get a graduate education. I felt immense pressure to finish by a certain time because I already had a postdoc lined up. Through all this, I was questioning my whole decision to stay in academia all together... at one point I couldn’t eat, sleep, or get out of bed.
My mental health unraveled so much that I had to seek professional help. I called the suicide hotline and got connected with my university counselor and psychiatrist. They developed a safety plan for me and I survived until the defense. I took medication and had a very routinized day, getting up in the morning, eating a balanced meal, working in a library, taking breaks, light exercise/walking, etc.

You know you're thinking irrationally and your own assessment on your work is probably affected by that. You can't trust your judgement of yourself right now, so if you start kicking yourself with thoughts of being a failure, etc.. you have to remember that those thoughts aren't trustworthy because they're not coming from someone in a good place. Some CBT might help with this, but the point is, you don't have to agree with the negative thoughts, work on countering them and rejecting them because logically they are not aiding to your success or wellbeing. 

I was convinced my work was terrible for a long time but I made peace with worst case scenarios and that allowed me to just focus on submitting.

My scenarios were:  It could be so bad they would kick me out with nothing - never happened in my department and chances of it happening when a supervisor likes your work is slim, if it happened to me I'd find a new career and move on. I could be given revise and resubmit - happened once in my department, the guy resubmit and passed, not the end of the world. Major corrections - bit of hassle but again you still get there in the end. Turns out I got minor corrections and put a lot of stress and energy into needless worry. 

Once you are done with your PhD you won't even think about it anymore and to be honest people don't ask you about it either. It just becomes a thing you did. I think with the money situation you wouldn't really want to quit, so just focus on submitting.

Jibeh,t2_9mfqk,"Sure, it's possible. I'm a TT instructor at a large university. I'm going up for tenure this year (file submitted, committee optimistic). The last three years at this job (out of four) I've been depressed, with therapy and medication helping little to none. Main symptoms fatigue, anhedonia, and hopelessness.

I'm in no position to give you advice on how to manage work and depression. (I'm also personally quite exhausted from hearing other people's advice.) But you asked whether it's possible, and the answer is ""yes."" Below are some notes from my experience.

Here are some things that work well:

* As far as keeping it together at work, *grad school trained me for exactly this scenario*. I pulled 80 hour weeks, doing research that may or may not work out, taking courses from joyless gate-keepers, attending seminars I didn't understand, plastering a smile on my face to teach. I have an amazing capacity to grind through work and pretend that nothing is wrong. Somehow when I'm not able to take a shower, I'm still able to edit a grant proposal. Also, now that I've settled into my job, I need fewer hours in the day to do my work, so it's like some school-related activities were replaced with depression-related activities.
* My job has awesome health benefits. I've been seeing psychologist that I really like, and without rationing visits I haven't yet overrun my counselling allowance. If I did overrun my counselling allowance, I'm paid well enough that it wouldn't matter. Medication is dirt cheap.
* My department has a strong culture of being terrible with email. So when I shut down and don't answer any emails for a week and a half, it's not a big deal. I come back with ""apologies for my late reply..."" and nobody bats an eye.
* I have my own office, with a desk I can crawl under. If I close the door, nobody knows whether I'm in or not.

Here are some things that work poorly:

* People starting out in academic careers get scattered to the four winds. You'll move to a place where you don't know anybody. You make academic friends, then they leave you for other positions.
* My school in particular has a shamefully high student-to-teacher ratio, especially in first-year courses (which are the bulk of my teaching load). Compassion fatigue feeds into normal fatigue. A lot of my students have quite serious mental health struggles, and I feel extra unequipped to support them. (Plus, nothing feeds into the cycle of hopelessness quite like a thousand first-year students treating the class discussion forum like it's 4Chan. Ugh.)
* Everybody complains all the time, and I don't have the mental resources to put it into a suitable context. A student complained that the assignment was poorly written, when in fact they just hadn't learned the things being evaluated? Clearly, the entire institution is a sham and I'm a part of it. Best to just give up. (Probably everybody complains all the time in non-academic jobs as well, but I have no experience in this so-called ""real world."")",2019-09-24 19:06:21,f1c823d,1,academia

In the very least, the advisor should wait until the student is in recovery before making any changes to the student's PhD, since this situation is likely to cause more harm to the student during what is likely a pretty rough time for them.

If you want to have a conversation with an academic advisor and want to be clear on what they must disclose (such as a sexual assault or abuse), I would recommend asking them before you begin that conversation. They will tell you exactly what they must report.

If there is something that you'd like to discuss with them that they would be mandated to report but you don't want leaving the room, many universities have contacts for confidential advocates. Sometimes they work for the county, and they're usually licensed clinical social workers who can listen to you without being forced to take it anywhere.

lianali,t2_95fq2,"Debt. Not all PhDs are fully funded, meaning you can incur a significant amount of debt while finishing up a PhD.

Extended time in low paying career path. In the sciences, the average time to finish a PhD is extending past 4 years, with an average of 5 years, and 8 years not being uncommon. This is for fields like chemistry, neuroscience, biochem, pharmd. Pair that with a post doc, sometimes 2 post docs, and that's 6 to 12 years spent at really low salaries for really huge work loads. Think 60-100 hour weeks with 20-30k student stipends, and 30K post doc salary, but now you have student debt to pay off during post doc. It's not fun.

Narrow job prospects. There are few job prospects for PhDs with rare exceptions. If you are great at demonstrating translatable skills, you'll be fine. If you're in hot research areas like drug development and testing, medical devices, and engineering, there is a market for advanced degrees WITH job experience. Outside of that? A PhD wildly overqualifies you for many jobs. They don't need a PhD for a production lab manager (usually).

TunakTunakAllDay,t2_57f7o44v,"Zotero is awesome!

I'll add these general stuff again in here just in case these haven't been reiterated enough:

I wish somebody told me to take feedback from supervisor, peers, etc more often and not think about the voices in my own head too much. As a then first gen masters student (and now as a phd student), I had no idea of how to evaluate myself and my progress in my projects, since there's no traditional examination when it comes to research. I learnt it late. Learn how to evaluate your progress by yourself, and keep track of where you are heading.

Speaking of voices in your head - social life is necessary. Even if you are a huge introvert like me, get out of your head. Go out. Talk to others. Do things that you like, outside of work. It helps with your mental health.

And exercise helps with the physical part of your health. Eat a balanced diet (can be very tough in grad school, but try hard). Take care of your body. Grad school will finish one day (or you'll quit, whatever). Don't lose your health in pursuit of your work.",2019-12-11 23:20:32,faif8wt,1,academia

Here is the situation: the lead author is my current PI, who is a perfectly nice guy and has conceptualised the study. The study is exclusively on HIS patients. He and the HOI are both medical doctors, so I don‘t think their statistical education was as sound as mine. I have a BSc/MSc/PhD in psychology and thus, 4 semesters of solid stats education. And then self-taught stuff and so on. My lead author/PI would NOT be able to this stats it I told him what he needed to do. The HOI knows sort of what to do and does it, and mostly does it kinda well. So that‘s how they collaborate on projects. 

Once this project is over, I‘ll have more projects with this PI whom I like working with. He‘s reasonably patient with me and kind. However, PI has a very high opinion of HOI‘s opinion and to some extent this is justified.

At the same time, I think professors could stand to be more accommodating to the issue through employing a variety of tactics for student engagement. For example, in classes where this is a problem, they might hand out cue cards where each student anonymously writes down a few questions and the prof then reads them out and addresses them each one by one.

dassy26,t2_353ezaxj,"A lot of this reminds me of many parts of my experience (I'm currently a 4th-year, but in a different field), and it took me a while (and regular appointments with a therapist) to finally start feeling like I'm in an okay place. Here are the things that made a huge difference for me: 

• The most significant change I had to make to my mindset was accepting that it's okay to do work that's just ""good"" when making my work excellent feels agonizing. A finished fellowship application is better than a perfect one that's impossible to get ready on time. Sending out two good proposals is better than exhausting myself trying to perfect one. This really helped me with procrastination because I found that, for me, it came from a place of performance anxiety. I was so worried about doing really well that I hardly did anything at all. With how much work the program requires, sometimes ""finished but not amazing"" really is an okay level of quality to expect. 

• I can't stand working in the office alone. I have to work with someone else (it's so much less alienating with a little company) or at least in a café or some space with human activity around me and ideally some sunlight. I also got together a few friends with whom I regularly meet to share work, and the support and community have been wonderful and a major confidence-booster. 

• I had to find a hobby and make myself schedule time for it. I take at least an afternoon or two a week to work on my photography, which I haven't let go of as a serious side project. It reminds me that the Ph.D. isn't all-consuming; I do have a life outside of school. 

• I really had to get back to a self-care routine. Now, I block out 45 min to an hour every morning for exercise, do meal prep to save myself time and stress during the week, etc. And I had some overdue bloodwork done. Taking care of vitamin B and D deficiencies helped a great deal with mood and energy levels and my overall feeling of wellness.

wheres-the-pig,t2_421eros0,"I’m at the tail end of mine now. I developed an anxiety disorder partway through that, to be honest, f***ed up my life in a major way and delayed completion significantly. Although I no longer have multiple panic attacks per day I’ve had long-term mental health issues with depression, lacking motivation and imposter syndrome as a result. Honestly there were underlying issues, but the PhD was the straw that broke the camel’s back. 

I don’t regret starting my PhD, but I wish I had handled it better. I think the counselling next week is a great idea for you. 

I gather from your post that you are still young. If you can take a leave of absence to get yourself together it may not be a terrible idea. It may also be worthwhile seeing if there is another research group you can work with, office you can work in, or supervisory team available. This may mean exploring switching university. Obviously that isn’t ideal, but if the PhD is really something you want and the environment is problematic you need to do something about it. I’m not going to tell you you need to learn to work with people or in crappy environments because you are an adult and you know what’s a genuine issue and what you can fix or endure. If you’re drowning get out of the pool, don’t just wait to go under. 

A good resource, I’ve found, is Tara Brabazon’s YouTube videos from Flinders University in Australia. She’s a little quirky and when I first watched one I wasn’t sure about her, but she is genuinely the most amazing and helpful resource I’ve found. Incredibly intelligent and empathetic and full of great advice. 

Before pulling the plug I’d think about why it is that you started the PhD. If it’s something you need for your career you’ll have to weigh up if it’s worth it to you to follow that career path. If it’s to challenge yourself there are other ways to go about that if the PhD isn’t working for you- learn a language, climb a mountain, start a business. If it’s because of pressure from family/friends it’s not worth it- if they really care they will just want you to be happy. 

I hope this helps- if nothing else you’ll know that someone has read what you said and had difficulties, too. Whatever you choose if you’re smart enough to get into the program in the first place (and remember, you were CHOSEN for this) you’ll be ok.

SilkKheldar,t2_z3cd5,"If you found it helpful, I'm glad - My experience was challenging, and while I know I am not you, and I don't know your personal journey with mental health, I'd like to think that if I made it through, you can, too - but I do think having a good support system is going to be really crucial to your success, because folks on here *aren't* wrong about how grueling this process can be at times. I had some personal tragedies during the process, too (I lost four family members and a close friend, two to suicide, during my PhD), and my research required me to travel abroad for months at a time, which was very isolating (even more so than a PhD normally is).  So please do not forget that I've acknowledged that ***I had a very supportive supervisor and family***, and I should have also said I have a very loving and supportive girlfriend. Again, I don't know your situation, but if you have these supports, great - if you don't right now, I would strongly recommend connecting with your chosen school's student accessibility office (whatever name it goes by), any student support groups you can find, and hopefully, your department (I don't know your field) will have an active grad student community, which can also really help.  


Other than that, as I'm sure you know, things like being active, forcing yourself to go do something unrelated to your school work every so often (in moderation), etc., can help too.

SilkKheldar,t2_z3cd5,"For shame, that so many people here have been downvoting this post and discouraging you from pursuing a PhD altogether. And good for you for calling them out on it.  I completed my PhD a couple years ago, and am someone who struggles with both a learning difference and mental health. I didn't go into much detail about it when I was applying (though admittedly, in my experience, schools don't really offer a good way *to* be forthcoming about that information, other than identifying whether or not you have a disability with a checkbox), but discussed the matter with my supervisor *after* I received the admission offer.   


But these things absolutely affected my experience in the program. I was very fortunate to have a supervisor and committee (mostly) who were supportive and understanding, to say nothing of how fortunate I am to have a healthy and supportive family life, without which I don't know if I could have finished.  And that's sadly rare in academia: often, if mental health or learning differences are discussed at all (instead of being ignored, dismissed, etc.), quite often the attitude still very much is 1) ""Well, that's your problem, isn't it?""  2) ""Well, this is a very demanding program, and we need to maintain the standards of that program to ensure that these kinds of degrees remain prestigious, so maybe you should consider whether this is right for you?""  3) ""A PhD is hard, and we all had to go through it and survive, so surely you can, too.""  All of which suggest that dealing with mental health or learning differences somehow makes you less intelligent, adaptable, or otherwise capable of doing a PhD.  Sometimes, even when a school IS understanding, the response still falls along the lines of ""Well, we're sympathetic, and we can do some accommodation, but we must avoid any hint that we're treating you differently than other students,"" because the attitude about accommodation is still very much centered on this notion that helping a student with challenges is giving them some sort of advantage, or putting things on ""easy mode"" while other students don't get that - when in reality it's simply balancing things out a bit to give you a fair chance.  


Heck, at my university's student accessibility services office, I learned that undergrads and grads are treated fundamentally differently.  If an undergrad is in some way differently abled, they register, develop a learning plan with the office's staff, and then that office informs the student's respective faculty/department/professors of what *will be done* to accommodate that student's needs. That instruction comes with the backing of administrative authority, and overrides any and all professors' whims or opinions.  For grads? ""Oh, well, we can discuss your needs here, and we'll be in the conversation, but typically your supervisor is the person you'll have to develop a plan with, since you're working directly with them. Once you two have agreed on a solution, we'll file it here and so the school will enforce that agreement.""  So, because of the nature of grad school (working directly with a supervisor rather than taking courses through a faculty), your accommodation comes down to what your supervisor is *willing* to do for you, and is therefore subject to all of their personal opinions and preconceptions about mental, physical health or learning differences.    


TL/DR: You should absolutely apply, and I applaud you for ignoring the (bad) advice of those suggesting you ""may not be able to handle"" a PhD. You can. I did. It will absolutely be difficult, and perhaps more so for you than for someone who doesn't have to contend with mental health.  I may not necessarily mention your depression on the application, but once you've been accepted, I think it'll be important to really meet your potential supervisor before choosing a school and mention it, to gauge their attitude.  There are also supports at university to help - you may have to fight occasionally for the accommodation you need. BUT APPLY!",2020-01-15 14:08:59,fegmm3g,1,academia

I am not a mental health professional, and I have no idea if the OP is, but I think it's not safe to assume that a suggestion someone might have a mental health issue is malicious or said to stigmatise.

I think it's reasonable to be able to talk about such things openly, and to do that, it has to be recognised that most recognisable symptoms of most mental illnesses are things that seem, to the outside, to be founded in a form of irrationality. That does not mean that, if pointed out, you are necessarily equating all irrationality with mental illness.

fursharkattack,t2_7ackuvd,"Was browsing through this sub, saw this post, and was disappointed the only “no” response lacked rationale.

Go for it if you’re willing to accept that your prospects for a full-time teaching position won’t increase too much and the competition for TT jobs is fierce. The market is saturated with PhDs without permanent positions. Full-time NTT positions are often temporary—expect to find a new job or even move every 1-3 years. More likely is cobbling together adjuncting gigs without benefits. Publishing in top-tier journals is not easy, and even then that doesn’t guarantee a job. 

Accept 3-6 years of a 20k salary often distributed over nine months, and that you will have to provide service to the university. If you’re lucky, that’s being an RA on a research project related to your interest, or it’s teaching, as a TA or instructor-of-record since you have an MA. Teaching will take time from coursework research, and publishing. Just as your job does now.

If your reasoning is mostly about being more competitive for full-time college teaching positions or fear of losing health care, I honestly don’t think that’s sustainable. First, a humanities/social science PhD is far more likely to hold a part-time or continent position than a full-time TT one. Second, grad school can be very isolating and take a toll on mental health. 

You need to have a very strong desire to produce knowledge that contributes something new to your field and/or teach in higher ed—this is key for resilience. Also useful is a financial safety net—the stress of survival can wear a person down if their funding runs out or if they find themselves without a job secured after graduation. It can also be motivating—but the state of the job market and hiring decisions are beyond individual control. 

If, after all this, you still feel compelled to work towards a PhD, I agree that you only go if you get funding and tuition waiver. Do not go into debt for a PhD primarily useful for academic jobs.

orion726,t2_77dwx,"It may take a little bit more time to adjust to the swing of things before you can properly hash out your schedule. A few things to keep in mind:

* Schedules can vary wildly. You will have periods of time when there doesn't seem to be enough hours in the day and periods of time when you can take off early everyday and it won't impact anything. These periods will line up differently for different people so it usually is a good idea to not compare your schedule to their schedule. 

* The start of a semester is usually hectic for everyone, even more so for new grad students. Don't treat the first few weeks (or even the first semester really) as a barometer for how the rest of your experience will go.

* You may have to force yourself to schedule down time. This is OK and it is better for both your physical and mental health. Try not to have the mentality that you have to choose between a good night's sleep and a successful academic career. 

* Weekly meal prep can be a big time saver. I love cooking but found myself too tired at the end of the day to want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen. Having meals made in advance is both healthier and cheaper than getting take out on those days.

Lucyjca,t2_10chmb,"I successfully completed my PhD at a UK University back in May. The advice to treat your PhD like a job is very important, though I would also stress how important is to then make time for yourself outside of the PhD. It is a strenuous process and having hobbies and other loves to sustain your broader sense of satisfaction is key to seeing this thing through to the end. Having little projects at home can also help to fulfil your sense of completion when the end of a PhD can feel so very far away (it creeps up on you though!). Prioritising your mental health is crucial!

Also, I recently read what is considered to be one of the [most helpful Reddit comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af) and an element of that comes to mind here. Rule 2: The 3 yous. Essentially, be grateful for the work past you has done (even when it is not as much as you would like, because it's still something) and always try to do favours for your future self. Don't put off writing until the last possible moment, do your future self a favour and jot down a little each day. You may not use all of it in your thesis but it will make a fantastic springboard for further ideas and may end up being useful for future publications too. To be honest, all four of his rules apply to PhD study if you fancy giving them a read.

MasterPatricko,t2_ch1z2,"I have a few thoughts after reading your story. I am not hugely experienced so feel free to disagree with my view.

I think you are being a unrealistic about how much freedom a postdoc working off someone else's grant money has. In many ways it is actually less than as a grad student -- the project (or person) which is paying for your time must get priority. A postdoc is generally NOT an independent researcher.
And yes a lot of postdoc work may be quite menial, especially in a small research group. Telling your PI that the work feels beneath you and is lab-tech work, in a small resource-constrained lab like yours seems to be, would seem incredibly arrogant to me. If you are being forced to do tasks inefficiently, or if your wider facility has other people/resources that your group is not using, that's different; your PI should be receptive to process improvements, but you as the junior member of the lab can't get out of doing what needs to be done.

Your PI has shown some understanding on a personal level (there is dialogue, even if it's not perfect), and you mentioned you are picking up new skills. Honestly I would say this part of it doesn't sound too bad.

One part which does worry me is that your group is losing members and you have made no mention of any research going well or the group adding new members. If new grants are very infrequent, no new collaborations, if there is no prospect of students joining, you don't want to be tied to a long, slow, inevitable decline. In which case get out as soon as possible without actively antagonising anyone (you still need references).
If this is only temporary, then when the group grows back to a healthy size, it will also relieve your frustration by dividing the work better, and giving you someone else to talk to during the day.

I would say you get to decide your own direction when you start writing your own grant proposals and start bringing in your own money.
There is no reason you can't start doing this now.
Either your ideas succeed, which is a nice bit of external validation for you personally, and probably takes a load off your PI's shoulders -- with your PI's permission, you could even try to start a few new collaborations; only the most petty of supervisors would be unhappy about their postdocs succeeding in this way.
Or your ideas fail, in which case you know your PI was not just being difficult in rejecting some of your proposals, and you gain a more realistic view of academia.

If it is really impossible to do this in your current position, and you really can't stand working without complete academic freedom, for your next position I would suggest you try looking for early-career fellowships, rather than postdocs on existing projects. I would still try to leave in a way which maintains a good relationship with your current PI, which might mean finishing your current contract -- references are hugely important -- but obviously don't completely sacrifice your own mental health for that. And note you can start applying for new positions well before your current contract is up (this is usually expected).

BrockProf,t2_vjpewdg,"I'm a social epidemiologist (and Asian) and I work in intimate-partner violence (also in discrimination and mental health). I think the best way to produce useful research is to work closely with community groups, clinicians, and policy makers already engaged with your topic. Many of them have years of experience working with your population group and have a good idea about what questions are useful. 

The worst thing to do (if you want to do primary data collection with vulnerable populations of any kind) is to burden people with research that will not be used and do not actually improve their wellbeing. There are too many researchers out there (particularly in the social sciences) that do not produce research linked to solutions. Work with people to design and evaluate solutions. If you are not directly working with people able to implement your suggested solutions - don't expect that someone someday might read your article and be inspired to do something (this almost never happens).

DocMondegreen,t2_wnbu1,"I switched advisors a year into writing my dissertation. I wish I recognized our incompatibility earlier, or that admin had recommended a change sooner. I would not have been nearly so far behind and I'm sure my mental health would have been better had I just done it earlier. 

It sounds like your admin supports you, which is really important. It means that you are not being blamed for this relationship. If another prof is willing to supervise, that means that they want to work with you and don't mind any backlash! Seriously- they wouldn't take on this duty unless they wanted to. One of the most common ways I've seen students get ""forced out"" of a program was when they lost their original advisor but no one else would advise.

How to Deal:

You are now in the uncomfortable role of employee/student who did nothing wrong but could be blamed because the boss is a jerk. You will be extremely polite and disengage from gossip. You will say mysterious and knowing things like ""It just wasn't working out, you know"" and ""I'm sure his \[topic\] skills are extremely strong."" When you don't badmouth him, he'll look like the asshole, especially since you were the student and he had the power in the relationship. You are the Ice Queen who will not give him the satisfaction of knowing he hurt you, even if you cry at home or in the bathroom. It will make you look like the mature person in this situation. It sounds like he's not in town often, so you won't have to keep this up every day, either.

Along with this, get in the habit of CYA if you are not already. Document your interactions and your work regularly. Send email after meetings that say, ""To confirm/summarize, I'll work on x, y, and z, this coming week."" Imagine that all of your emails will be read in front of a court, so keep them totally professional. 

I know that this sucks, but you can get through it. If everyone knows how this guy is, it really won't reflect on you that much. Other profs will say things like, ""Oh, So-and-so almost tanked another student's career,"" but they'll focus more on his behavior than yours. It sounds like admin might already be tracking his behavior and building a case for reprimanding him (maybe firing him, if you're lucky). After graduation, no one really cares who your first supervisor was. They'll maybe care about who you finished your project with, but more likely, they'll mainly care that you finished.",2018-11-13 13:01:53,e9m4toa,2,academia

To clarify, you're a UK student who was studying abroad for a semester and 'failed' modules there, correct? The first thing to understand is how you failed. Are we talking a soft or hard fail, or a failure to submit?

It being during a study abroad period might be in your favour, as your home university might be more accommodating. Failing two makes that trickier, but they'll be able to advise.

foibleShmoible,t2_i61ju,"Mental health is a serious matter, and not your fault, but you do need to take responsibility for how you handle it. Ideally, when you first started struggling you'd have reached out to your director of studies/personal tutor to talk about the problems and any accommodations you might need. Now you need to do the same thing, but after the fact it is harder to prove that your existing issues are genuine and not just an attempt to cover for poor performance.

A few things. First off, are you getting support (from your doctor or a counselling service - your university should be able to refer you to the latter if you aren't using one yet)? That will help you with your issues, while also providing you with proof that this isn't just you trying to pull one over on them.

Secondly, talk to your personal tutor **now**. Send them an email ahead of term starting and explain briefly that while you were away you had issues with your mental health that impacted your work, that you understand you should have raised this much sooner, but now you would like to discuss what you need to do to stop this happening again next semester, what accommodations might be necessary and can be made in future, and if there are any possible ways you can make up the failed modules (unlikely but you might as well ask). Ask for a meeting with them once uni starts again to discuss it all in more detail. And make it clear that you aren't just asking for a pass/concessions here; you know that you need to put in the work but that you just need help figuring out how best to do that.

Thirdly, reach out to your student services. Your student union will have a welfare person/team. Ask them for any guidance that might be specific to your university, particularly if you find you have trouble working things out with your personal tutor.

Finally, DON'T PANIC. This is 2 modules out of, what 12? 16? They don't necessarily have to sink your entire degree, or your academic aspirations. Get things straightened out, figure out a plan so that you can succeed at the rest of your degree, and see where that leaves you. Different universities have different ways of figuring out final degree classifications, so these two modules probably won't be the end of you.

The power structures in academia are deeply troubled and cannot be salvaged. 

For example, a first-year female PhD student was convinced into coming in to the lab at absurd hours to check on experiments. This was a bit frustrating, but she thought it was just something she'd have to be willing to accept to her to pursue this wonderful opportunity!

Over time, her advisor began criticizing her work. There were mistakes and she was pressured to increase her hours in the lab. She saw less of her friends and became more committed to finding a way to please her advisor.

By the second year, she was spending nearly all her waking hours in the lab. She had little contact with anyone who was not part of the lab. She was fully committed. She was in the lab alone at night and in weekends, except for when a post-doc or the advisor were there. She was dedicated to her important work! 

**She was repeatedly sexually assaulted.** After a long period of silent trauma, she made a complaint. The department protected the advisor. She left the university and got a job working at a grocery store.

It doesn't matter what field you are in. The power imbalance in academia is exploitative to the very core. A math student is just as likely to put a bullet through her brain as an literature student.

Do not be complicit in systems of authoritarian exploitation. Do not go to grad school.

sb138,t2_15tdfi,"It's difficult to answer your question because it truly is a sort of chicken-or-egg situation and is often different for each individual.  Also, it depends on the atmosphere of the graduate school and program, your financial situation, and how well you balance the other responsibilities surrounding your graduate career.

Here's my story: mental illness runs in my family and includes depression, anxiety, OCD, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.  Yes, all of these family members are highly-educated and tend to lean toward the arts.  Personally, I have a history of anxiety and OCD, but I had it somewhat under control until 3 years into graduate study.  I have always been a perfectionist, highly critical of myself and overly-analytical about everything, but I found solace in literary study, art and music.  So yes, there's that introverted, perfectionist background of the academic that lends itself to both mental illness and the probability of continuing one's education.  In addition, the literary works I gravitate toward to tend to be more psychological and depressing, so there's that as well.  But shortly before I went to graduate school, much of that isolation and perfectionism had gone to the wayside.  I'd go so far as to say I was a bit full of myself at the beginning because I had graduated from a more prestigious university for undergrad and had taken a couple of years off to study for the LSAT and explore my options.  During that break I spontaneously moved 10 hours away from my hometown to live with my best friend in a shitty little apartment outside of NYC and made money by teaching pre-k, and I was damned good at it, winning ""teacher of the year"" my first year teaching.  I also got engaged a year before graduate school, and everything seemed to be working out nicely.  For the first time in my life, I felt good about myself, my abilities and my future; I was nothing but confident and ready for the next step.

By the time I had decided on graduate school, I had switched gears and, instead of going to law school as I had originally planned, I realized I was more passionate about literary analysis and teaching and entered an English graduate program that was meant as a sort of doctoral program with master's along the way.  The first couple of years were fantastic, and I felt like the 'golden child' of the program.  It was as though I had found my people, and I was thrilled to be amongst people who were nerds for theory as much as I was.  Almost immediately I had my master's thesis published by a literary journal, and I considered most of my professors supportive mentors within the span of only a couple of years.  I was set, had my permanent committee organized and on board way before my peers, felt great about everything and had no doubt in my mind that I'd get that longed-for tenure-track job once I graduated from the doctoral program because I had excellent references, strong support and a few publications under my belt.

Well, as life often goes, things didn't go as planned, and, by the end of the first year of the doctoral program, I was on 3 different medications to control my anxiety and ever-growing sense of dread in the morning when I had to go to campus to teach an introductory composition course to a group of less-than-enthusiastic freshmen.  My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer a year later, I had to push back my exams because I was driving home every other weekend to help her through chemotherapy, and my exams did not go well because I had one particular committee member who was giving me a hard time.  Because I was often gone due to my mother's cancer treatments, I wasn't seen around campus as often, causing my committee to basically forget about my exams.  I showed up to take my exams on the scheduled date, but my chair had forgotten to prepare my materials!  I went home in tears, wallowing in self-pity and old episodes of Futurama over pad thai and ice cream.  Eh, we were all partly to blame for that situation, but I took it HARD.  I've never tested well and suffer from debilitating testing anxiety anyway, so while I was never worried about writing and publishing, the idea of being judged on a stressful timed exam sent me over the edge.  Having actually been *forgotten* was the absolute worst.  I started having schizophrenic episodes (heard voices, imagination going wild - that sort of thing).  I had to go to therapy and was closely monitored because I admitted I had thought of suicide as an option if I didn't pass my exams.  It was a bad, scary time in my life, but I passed my exams with a couple of caveats (made to appease the one committee member with a chip on his shoulder who said I lacked the confidence necessary to be a scholar).  The anxiety subsided after I passed my exams, but I never fully regained the confidence I had before beginning the doctoral program.  I started questioning my self-worth and place in academia (yes, imposture syndrome is a very real thing, and most everyone I know suffers from it), and then the humanities positions started drying up fast anyway (I'm still an on-again, off-again adjunct professor making next to nothing with a total of 4 degrees to my name and a ridiculous amount of student loan debt).  With all that said, I breezed through my dissertation, enjoyed the research and writing, and ultimately found that graduate school shaped me for the better.  I only wish I hadn't taken it all quite so seriously and had maintained some form of life outside of my academic work.  I honestly can't say whether it was graduate school itself that took a massive toll on my mental health or if it was the unrealistic expectations I had for myself, expectations I probably would have had regardless of what path I had decided to take.

I'm sorry if my story didn't directly answer your question, but even after thinking back and analyzing my own experience, I still can't decide if people like me are simply more inclined to go to graduate school or if I am a product of the burning hoops I was made to jump through.  Others I know had much happier and positive experiences, and all I can say is those who had an easier time in graduate school had strong communities of friends, met with their mentors often for coffee and discussion, and spent a LOT of time at the bars on the weekends enjoying life outside of graduate school with grad buddies.

MCwaffle89,t2_9wxm3,"Ok cool a lot to work with here. So I'll preface this by saying this is my experience and I'm still finishing my degree so take what I say with a grain of salt, I'm not an expert (just someone who is in the process).

I would focus on finishing out the associates degree and then finishing out the bachelors first, for sure have a plan of what you want to do (grad school if that ends up being where you want to go), but focus on getting though the  next few years first. Talk to your professors as well both at the community college where you're at but maybe more importantly at the school you end up going to for your bachelors (they may be more likely to have a PhD compared to community colleges where at least by me you can teach with a masters). They can give you a sense of the next steps and what they would advise you to do.

Social Science PhD's (sociology, political science, anthro, history, etc) are generally research and teaching degrees. If you're interested in practicing something (like public health) you can usually do that with a Bachelors and a masters. If you're interested in academia (teaching and research) then most places require a PhD.

The motivation to study and learn is huge for a PhD, once you finish course work you're set free to work on the dissertation, you get guidance along the way and you have a committee and advisor to help guide you but there is much less structure compared to classes and course work. So you have to self motivate to get your stuff done, which works well for some people and not as well for others.

Grad school has high minded conversations for sure but at least in my experience there is a lot of stupid conversations to take minds off the research. While I hate the ""work hard play hard"" statement, in my experience there for grad school it's more ""work smart, play stupid"". I have friends in my program that are into cross fit, triathlons, acting, poetry and writing, knitting, etc. So while research and finishing the degree is the #1 priority you have to unwind some how and for many of us that involves some mindless unrelated task. Also grad school, at least for me, has been weirdly solitary and social at different time. I work on my own research where I'm just plugging away by myself on my own work but I'm also on two other projects where I'm collaborating with people. You'll find link minded people, academia attracts a unique bunch, which is nice to find a community. I worked for a bit before coming to grad school and I really enjoy my work environment now much more. I'm around like minded people who enjoy similar topics and while we may not do the same research we can get together and discuss what we're working on and bounce ideas off each other.

Fair warning, grad school is hard and rough, and as a result is notorious for being really taxing existing mental illnesses or surfacing them in people. If you take a look through the r/gradschool there are lots of mental health posts in there from students. Just giving you a heads up, it seems like a common theme across disciplines and schools.

Grad school for me was a great choice, I like academia and I fit in there. I like research and teaching so this seems to be the right path for me. I wouldn't be set in stone on anything at this point, but have a rough idea of a plan for sure. Talk to your professors and see what they say, they will know what paths are open to you and what paths make sense given your interests. Bounce ideas off them and see what sticks. I graduated undergrad and went straight into law school which was a disaster and I left after one semester. I talked with my professors (from undergrad) about what I should do and they suggested a PhD program. I probobly should have talked with them about my plans rather than being set in stone that I wanted to go to law school. Grad school is a great option for some people, but that is a personal decision and depends a lot on where you are in your life. Happy to help and let me know if I can be of any other help with things!

mistixs,t2_n7ux4,"&gt; Where are you at in terms of schooling? Undergrad? High school? Post-College?

Right now I'm finishing up my Associate's at a community college &amp; currently figuring out where I want to go next to get my Bachelor's.

&gt; What area of social science?

sociology and psychology, I suppose.

In fact, my original major at my community college was Sociology, but I changed it to General Curriculum to get a taste of other majors, since I know that sociology majors have among the highest unemployment rates. (When getting a PhD, I wouldn't have that problem, because Social Science PhDs actually have among the *lowest* unemployment rates, even lower than engineering, physical sciences, and computer sciences.)

https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf14310/

I'm planning on getting my Bachelor's in Public Health because that has much higher employability &amp; it has many opportunities which are pretty social-sciencey.

one of the colleges I'm looking at has a major option of Public Health &amp; also has an honors program wherein you'd pick a track in addition to your major, and ""social sciences"" is one of them! I'd get to have my cake and eat it too! Plus the honors program involves research projects, which might give me a preview of whether I'd want to get a PhD!

Hopefully I'll be able to get in. I currently have a 3.9 GPA, not because I'm particularly smart (even though my professors &amp; academic counselors insist that I am very smart, I actually have an IQ on the *lower* end of average, though to be fair I score ""very superior"" in terms of verbal/writing abilities) but I really do love school, at least when it comes to the stuff I'm interested in. (...is that a good sign when it comes to possibly pursuing a PhD?)

specific things I'm interested in involve women and women's experiences and women's health.

I also have side-interests in mental health, &amp; spirituality and religions of all kinds and their effects, both positive and negative. it's ironic since i'm not religious or spiritual myself. from my research, i see that spirituality has many positive effects, but i have so little motivation to partake in it (despite enjoying reading about it).

i don't have much motivation to do *anything* except schoolwork &amp; ""reading about random shit on the internet"" (as my mom puts it). i literally spend most of my school-breaks laying in bed all day, sometimes on the laptop reading, or otherwise just laying there or sleeping (sleeping sometimes for up to 30 hours). (yes i've been diagnosed mentally ill)

maybe grad school would be good for me socially since i assume many other people would be interested in deep thoughtful philosophical conversations like i am. i've always been a loner. i don't even talk to my family much because we don't enjoy the same type of talk. as i said, i like long deep thoughtful philosophical conversations, which my family *can't stand*.

i've been thinking about how being such a loner isn't really healthy - what's gonna happen when my family dies, and i can no longer rely on them for any help and support? it'd be healthier to maintain good relationships with people so that we can help and support each other. 

maybe grad school would provide more opportunities to meet and talk to people who enjoy talking about the same things that i do. of course many of them may be wrapped up in research, so we may not be able to talk as much, but that'd actually be *good* for me since i need a lot of alone-time to recharge anyway. quality over quantity, for me. and i think grad school might provide that.",2017-05-11 07:05:43,dhetvkx,1,academia

Dcmcm,,"Yes, academia is fucked up. 

But we have to work within it if we want to be academics. Burnout is something you have to take seriously, continual stress doesn't make your life or your work better. Take a week off (I would suggest more, but the thought of that might be even more stressful). 

Meet up with your other three authors on this paper and share a bottle of wine or three while speculating on the different animals' DNA that may have made it into reviewer 2's bloodline over the generations - and then choose another deadline and agree to work on the paper together.   

Other suggestions:

Find some people to write with. Doing it alone sucks. You have already got a group of 3 others you are working on a paper with, and you are in a lab with other students and researchers - use them and let them use you. Suggest a writers workshop every few months where people can bring unfinished and rejected manuscripts and get feedback on them (make it a rule to start with positive comments and don't allow negative without suggestions to fix it). 


Getting papers rejected sucks, but you have to learn to offload some of the blame to the random number generator that determines what AC your paper gets assigned to, and how that determines what reviewers they will know to call on, and the chances that 1/2 of them will be too busy and say no so they will have to find other people based almost entirely on matching the keywords from your abstract to other people's papers or online profiles. 

You also have to not read harshness or personal criticisms into the reviews (which is difficult, I know), and work on translating the points into what you have to do to get the paper accepted somewhere else:

You don’t explain what other people are doing and why what you do is better --&gt; The contribution (for this audience) isn't clear and up front. Explain it more simply, in more general terms, in the introduction and conclusion. 

There are ways to improve the stuff, you don’t take everything into consideration --&gt; Again this goes back to the contribution. When people say things like this it often means that you haven't made crystal clear what this incremental step towards the goal actually gives the community. Be very clear about what you have and haven't done, what the goal is for the work in this paper and how this fits in relationship to the larger goals of the field. 

You don’t have enough use-cases and experiments --&gt; Unless this is backed up with actual numbers (X isn't enough to show significance because of A, B, and C) then this also goes to the last point, if the reviewer thinks you are making a bigger point than your results and experiments support then they will tell you that you need more results and experiments to make it - they don't know your work or data like you do, so it is very difficult to concretely suggest narrowing the focus to what is presentable from the work already done. 

Finally, don't think it is deceiving anyone to give up, or take an extended break for your own mental health. You should be able to negotiate to stop the clock for 6 months and go pick veggies in New Zealand or something.

iwantabrother,,"Oh boy, a professor here, and I think you're missing at least half the point. 

To me, the hardest part of being an academic is not the academics itself - I've always been confident of my academic abilities and the ability to keep producing papers (and unless you're at this level of confidence, academia will destroy your mental health...) But the thing that stressed me out was the fact that my life was put on hold for so long.

Between grad school, postdoc, and tenure-track, I made several long-term research visits to various places in the world as well, and I never stayed in the same place for more than a couple of years max (sometimes moving every semester). I'm not talking moving houses, I'm talking about moving countries.

This made it very hard to forge long-lasting interpersonal relationships, and the few friends/SOs that I managed to make all disappeared from my life with my next move. Towards the end of my postdoc, I decided that it wasn't worth making friends anymore and chose to be the loner aside from the departmental colleagues, because I was so sick of putting all the work into making friends only to have it disappear a year later.

The competitive job market was also really difficult for me. As I said, I was very confident (99% of the others weren't, and it threw them into depression or anxiety, so this is something to think about) that I could get a job. The problem was, *where* would I get a job? Plenty of great universities are situated in the middle-of-nowhere towns that would die off so quickly if that university weren't there. I would literally have no chance to meet people outside of the university if I ended up in one of these towns (you think you wouldn't be a part of it; I thought I'd definitely be a professor at Harvard when I started out in grad school. Your life goals go through a severe modification process while in academia! Majority of people in academia are thankful to get *any* positions, including the ones in crappy towns. I wasn't.)

Then the politics was really difficult for me. It just killed me that some people could get jobs because their advisors are well-connected, or because their best friend's institutions were hiring, they could get interviews easily. I was raised in an academic environment where people look down on politics (my advisor is a very special and competent researcher) so I had no idea how to play the politics game. 

In the end, I really lucked out by getting an R1 job in a large city without having played any political game. But I am a very very rare case, I actually can't think of many others like me. It also means that I'm surrounded by people who are super into political games. It feels slightly toxic but I guess I like research enough that I'm going to stick with it for now.

Being in academia took a huge emotional toll on me; if I could choose my life over again, I'd probably just become a doctor or a lawyer or something. I only survived because I was absolutely certain that I wanted to be a professor, and because I always believed in my abilities. If you don't have that kind of conviction, believe me, academia will do much more damage.

Just remember that it's your *life* that you're trying to make a decision on. Don't just consider your academic abilities and aptitude; also think very hard about whether this lifestyle is for you. It's a very unique one. I still travel up to 3 months in a year, and it turns out that I'm not a fan of traveling. Uh-oh.",2017-09-02 18:54:54,dmh7hat,1,academia

I would specifically avoid saying that the issue was that your parents separated, only because this is an extremely common thing to have happen. It affects everyone differently, so there is nothing wrong with the way you handled it. However, because it's so common, the interviewer/advisor likely also has personal experience with it (or knows plenty of other people who do). If they reacted differently, they may use their experience to set a baseline of how they think people should respond to that scenario, and may judge you negatively for responding to it in a different way.

Audiblade,t2_kfd4l,"Unlike the others in this thread, I think your decision to leave academia may very well be there right one to make. Quite frankly, I left after my masters degree because I saw that academia has a pervasive culture of extraordinary overwork. One of my graduate advisors told me she works 80 hours every week and considered that normal for an academic career. Because there are so many people with PhDs competing for a very limited number of professorships, the only people who have successful academic careers are those willing to work extremely long hours. If you don't absolutely love research, don't destroy yourself doing it.

One thing I would suggest you consider is figuring out what the bare minimum you need to do to get your PhD is and finishing up your degree before leaving for industry. If you have your PhD, your advanced degree will open up doors that will remain open for the rest of your life. You won't be able to continue in academia without a list of strong papers, but that sounds like something you don't want anyway.

NoxiousQuadrumvirate,t2_kywisro,"Let me give you the perspective of one of the students you think so little of: me. 

I'm diagnosed with schizophrenia and ADHD. My symptoms were diagnosed well before I started university, and I take responsibility for my disabilities. I attend regular counselling and plan as much of my work as possible so that the interference of those disabilities is minimised. 

I got extra time and a separate testing centre for all of my exams because I needed the assistance to focus. When doing homework, or now when working on my own research, I can retreat to my office or my home and work to my strengths. If I'm having a tough hour, I can do other less taxing work for a bit and come back to the hard stuff when I feel more up to it. But standard exams don't allow that. I'd be forced to do (what was at the time) incredibly difficult and demanding work whilst surrounded by an absolute cacophony of noise and movement, and with no reprieve for when that undoubtedly gets to be too much. I'd panic and be unable to follow a train of thought. My mind got clouded and I'd lose the ability to read. I would have failed. And that failure would not have actually represented any data point of value, because not even in research am I judged under exam conditions. There is no job in existence that would judge under those conditions. I was being tested on what I knew, not how well I could perform under arbitrary circumstances.

And I was never a bad student. I consistently got A+s in all internal assessments and labs, and with the accommodations made to my exams, I got A+s in those too. 

I graduated from 2 majors in 3 years with a cumulative 4.0. I handed in all work on time and attended my classes. I did research throughout and published my first first-author publication as a freshman. I did outreach work, taught introductory classes, and gave lectures over that time as an undergraduate as well. Would you dare try to argue that I was a poor student? Or that I was ""delicate""? 

And I'm not the only one either. I know a number of people who had different disabilities but similar achievements. Disability doesn't mean ""less intelligent"". It means that there are certain things you find it harder to do.

Part of the reason why you think students with disabilities must be bad students is because struggling is often a pre-requisite for diagnosis. Plus, the stigma for mental health is very strong, which you are actively contributing to right now. I never struggled academically but psychosis is hard to ignore in any case. Someone whose ADHD causes them to get a B when they should have gotten an A is possibly going to go undiagnosed. In reality, quite a few of your good students may be doing well *in spite of* disability, but that just means that your tests are not accurately measuring what they know and can do.

[When roughly 20% of the population has a mental health issue](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml), it's not that far-fetched to see 1/6 of your class experiencing some kind of mental illness.

KaesekopfNW,t2_rj6pd,"&gt; Interestingly enough, none of the strongest students ever seem to suffer from mental disabilities anyway.

I find this to be an odd comment, given that academia is rife with mental illness. The whole process of the pursuit of a degree, which gets worse the higher you go, often destroys people's mental health. The constant stress, the advisor abuse, the low pay and high workload for grad students - all of these can ruin a person. When you factor in exogenous stressors, like a person's work life outside of classes, or financial strain, or strain with friends, family, or a partner, or the death of loved ones, or any kind of traumatic experience, mental health can be destroyed even further.

So that said, I guarantee you that a good portion of your strongest students were very much suffering from mental illness in some way. The problem with your view, it seems, is that you refuse to acknowledge mental illness as a problem equivalent to a physical disability. Just because someone doesn't ""look"" the part, doesn't mean he or she isn't suffering internally.

And quite honestly, given your dismissive attitude and the fact that you refuse to help these students who are open about their struggles indicates to me that students who have mental illnesses probably would never feel comfortable opening up to you in the first place.

providing extra support and aids (like specialist teachers or equipment)

Perhaps I should have asked instead:

Who decides what is reasonable? Is the disability office more competent to decide what is reasonable than class professors and heads of academic departments or undergraduate or graduate offices? Why?

arrrrr_won,t2_ib5q7,"No, not exactly. Especially since you are asking about whether schools ""have"" to do something or other, that implies legality, and that's complicated. Also, I am not a lawyer. My work pertains to accommodations, however.

In the US, many issues are complicated because there are usually state and federal laws pertaining to a topic. There is a difference between public and private schools at the federal level for K-12 education (primary and secondary schools, to age 18) - in that, generally, public schools have to abide by certain rules, including mental health accommodations, while private schools do not. Many private primary/secondary schools do *not* provide accommodations like extra time on tests, at least in my state. But for nation-wide standard tests, like the SAT, then accommodations can be granted for the test regardless of public or private school.

You're talking about university though, and I'm betting that in the US there is a similar divide between public and private schools, but I'm not sure. It could also vary by state whether accommodations are legally ""guaranteed"". If there is a private school somewhere that did not provide accommodations, there may not be a disability office at all, or at least not one that is in tune to mental health accommodations. Most universities, regardless, do have some sort of student service that provides accommodations, but that can be more for things like hard of hearing, or access for physical disabilities. For mental health at university, it's more on a case-by-case basis whether a given student would get extra time for a given class at a given university. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, sure does, but it's not as ""required"" at this level practically-speaking, at least in my experience.

I'd say it really depends, and it might be a case of trial and error. As in, you may not know if you can handle it until you're doing it. 

Scenario 1 - your personal connection gives you extra motivation and insight into your work. Your passion could amplify your work. Possibly the type of work would be abstract enough that you aren't confronted with the _worst_ aspects of Alzheimer's daily. It's not just a job in the 9 to 5 sense because you know what is at stake and you see the larger picture of how your perhaps sometimes mundane 9 to 5 work contributes to the greater good. For at least someone's grandparents if not yours. 

Scenario 2 - it does take a toll emotionally and your wellbeing suffers. Maybe it makes you more aware of the painful aspects, or maybe it's not that you're more aware just that it's constantly in your consciousness and you have a harder time being objective or concentrating. 

One of the key factors to helping you have more of a Scenario 1 experience might be ""self care"" which is a common thing that professionals who work in draining or difficult settings do to protect their mental health.

I am also a procrastinator and so at the start of my Masters I thought, nah I've got this and then put it off for 2 years because due to depression I struggle with motivation a lot. I have now had to finish my whole thesis in a month and am like 2 weeks away from the deadline and still working. I wish I had told my supervisor what was happening because now our relationship has soured.

However, I do think that it may not have had as much of an impact as I would have hoped because of the general nature of academia. I think there needs to be more awareness of mental health issues in academia, especially postgraduate studies. Many students feel overwhelmed and depressed but cannot talk about it. It is almost glossed over whenever I have spoken to other academics about it.

So, I would say don't put the work off because there's so many revisions along the way and things change so many times.

I recall an interesting survey (http://www.ucu.org.uk/media/pdf/4/5/HE_stress_report_July_2013.pdf) where university employees feel a greater level of stress as compared to those in the wider UK population. This was a quick search mind you just to see if there were any such studies.

But based of my personal experience, and what I've directly seen for myself with other students and postdocs, there are a few factors  that are more prevalent in academia as opposed to other jobs that, when combined, are likely to lead to mental health issues.

I can think of 3 main factors at the moment:


1) Increased workloads. Fairly obvious one - publish or perish. But even if you dont want an academic career, if you're planning on moving on after your PhD or postdoc into other areas of work, this increased workload can still very much affect you. I would also like to add that work never finishes at work, as with our department particularly, all the lab work should be done at work and all the reading and writing at home or weekends. Receiving e-mails at unsociable hours is also the norm. 


2) PIs. These people dont rise to their positions because of their fantastic managerial skills, they're there because they published lots and/or networked with the right people.  In my case, my personal PI and many other PIs in my department (there are a few genuine gems but they're jumping ship) are horrible people to put it simply. 


3) Perfectionism. Being surrounded by other smart people can affect you. Working hard and getting no decent results, while others are getting a lot of results can affect you.

SnowblindAlbino,t2_7ild5,"History of medicine and mental health are in some ways hot fields, in that there is interesting scholarship being done and interest from publishers. That said, they are also tough markets for faculty jobs because there are very few teaching colleges that will ever hire in those subfields...if you only have 5-6 faculty in your history department you'll likely have 2-3 Americanists tops. In that situations it's likely you'd hire one colonial, one 19th c., and one 20th c. person. Are you going to hire a history of medicine person as your single 20th c. Americanist? Probably not.

Given that reality, such a specialty thus makes a tough job search even tougher, as you'd be restricted to a subset of a subset of the market, i.e. the few jobs likely to pop up in more research-oriented or larger teaching institutions that would have the breadth to make room for a history of medicine type.  To avoid that, you'd really want to have a parallel specialty in something that is much more marketable, like gender or race, and then use the medicine piece as a secondary field.

Take a look at the H-Net job listings for the last few years, or the Chronicle listings, for history of medicine. You'll find there aren't a whole lot, which is one reason there aren't a whole lots of Ph.D.s being produced in those fields (relative to more common ones at least) unless they are clearly developing multiple areas of expertise for the market.

(I say this as someone who has advocated hiring an historian of medicine for the last many years, only to have my colleagues collectively argue that we cannot ""waste"" a hire on such an esoteric specialty...the last hire was a Civil War historian instead. While that *could* have been someone who did history of medicine as well, the pool of 175+ candidates did not include a single such applicant.)",2014-03-15 13:50:42,cg37cmc,2,academia
