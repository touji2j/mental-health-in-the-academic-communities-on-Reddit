cl6imhb,RedBugs,t2_5zz85,"I have friends who've quit their PhDs at various points and, dude, they're doing well in life, truly enjoying paths they'd never even thought of before leaving.

Academia can be a bit of a cult. All your advisors, department heads, etc. got there because they're passionate about their subject and couldn't imagine wanting to do anything else, and so threw enormous amounts of energy (and no small amount of luck) into getting where they are today. That's great if it's making them happy, but the downside is that as a student, everyone you look up to thinks that academia is the ultimate goal that everyone should strive for, and can't think of leaving as anything other than failure. This manifests in obvious ways (e.g. in scientific fields, moving into industry is ""selling out"" or ""joining he dark side""), but also in more subtle shifts in attitude when talking about other options. 

Coupled with this is the fact that, as a grad student, you've always been really good at school. Being smart and good at your subject, and being able to say ""I'm a [subject]ist!"" is probably a major part of your identity, and a big source of self-respect. With so much of your identity tied up in your status as a grad student, it's easy to think ""I'm doing badly at school so I'm a worthless person"". This is NOT true. Sure, being a grad student has sucked up a lot of your attention, but it's not the sum total of who you are. Your friends and family don't love your ability to bash out an essay after three hours' sleep, they love and respect you for who you are, and still will tomorrow. 

There's also a very real chance that this is the first big thing you've *ever* ""failed"" at, which makes it seem catastrophic and life-destroying. This is not true either. People miss life goals, have major setbacks, and experience soul-crushing failures all the time. But we pick ourselves up, dust off, and slowly a new path and a new goal appear. It's possible that you don't have the practice at that, at least not with stuff that feels this big. Don't get me wrong, this would suck for *anyone*, and feeling bad is totally understandable. My point is that slowly, and with plenty of missteps along the way, you're going to surprise yourself with your resilience.  

All of which is to say: If you choose to leave academia, that's OK. A PhD is a means to an end, not a way of life or the core of your identity. Grief is a totally rational reaction to closing the doors on whatever career you'd imagined, and shame is a totally understandable response to leaving the cult of academia and putting a dent in your self-image. But those will heal. Hopefully you've met some great people and learned some great stuff. If it's not for you, then that's something you've learned too. Life is not over, just because you've quit a course. 

Right now: Talk to someone you can rely on (family, close friends). You're probably expecting them to be disappointed in you but, I promise you, their only concern will be that you're OK. Get your support network in place, then book whatever time you can to just crash and get your head in order, including human contact (even if it's just phonecalls) so you don't just spiral into deeper misery.

Finally, for now, get the contact info for your school's mental health services and make an appointment. I guarantee that this sort of thing is completely normal to them, and they'll have some great resources to help with all of this. Even if your changing status at the uni means that they can't treat you, they're the best people to recommend an external service for you to contact.

After all this: It really sounds like you can't (couldn't?) write due to stress, depression or whatever. Talk to the schoo's mental health people about this, too. This is really common, and if you want then you might be able to change your ""I quit"" to a temporary withdrawal, spend some quality time with a shrink, and come back to attack your thesis with some shiny new coping mechanisms. Mental health issues amongst grad students are alarmingly common: your school knows this, and will have procedures in place to help you deal. 

It's totally OK to just walk away and try a new path, if that's what you want. It's probably still possible to get help, take a break and then re-attack your thesis, if *that*'s what you want. Either way: what your're feeling now sucks, is totally valid, and will fade with time.

drj7opk,HermanTheKid,,"So I'm not trying to be dismissive, I just want to provide a counterpoint and possible reality-check. I think that one of the large problems with academia is that it has a negative self-image because so many academics (and especially grad students) have not recently been employed outside the academe. Let's look at some of the detractions you laid out:

* Poor work-life balance: This is common in many white collar jobs where people take their work home with them. If you want to leave your job behind you when the whistle blows at 5, you can always pick up a shovel or learn to weld.     
* How PhD students are treated: PhD students are treated a heck of a lot better than most employees working a 9-5. Support services are offered, lots of social events, flexible hours, health plans. Most people would love to have that. Admittedly, that students crave PI approval so much can generate problems, as many employees in other industries really couldn't care less what their boss thinks of them.      
* Petty politics - literally every job. Sick of working the register and want to work the deli counter? Better play some petty politics.     
* The publish or perish mentality: I get that publishing expectations have increased for teaching faculty, but in general ""publish or perish"" among research faculty is simply stating that employees need to be judged using some sort of quantifiable metric. The ""hang sheet-rock or perish"" mentality is just as pervasive. It's just not as idiomatic.       
* Poor pay: relative to what profession? Sure, we make less than most physicians, and probably have a median salary below most attorneys (mean salary won't be helpful in that comparison because of heavy rightward skew in the legal profession), but the job market isn't exactly a secret. Personal choice has to come into play here at some point.        
* Lack of respect from the general populace: I get more respect than most blue collar employees, though admittedly not as much as someone with equivalent years of post-graduate education in medicine or law. I'm not sure I care that much, though if your motivations are more external then your gratification may vary.     
* Dealing with stifling bureaucracy: I've got to give you this one.      
* Whether or not student mental health is treated as a priority: This strikes me as a strange complaint. As far as institutional investment  goes, the mental health of graduate students is probably second only to that of pilots, air traffic controllers, and (arguably) military personnel. Mental health seems like a dire issue in academia at least in part because Type A individuals with high anxiety like you and me self-select academia as a career path. I think it's mostly a selection bias to be honest. The students I've known that had serious mental health needs typically had them met, and almost certainly would have had similar needs had they worked a cubicle job somewhere. 

Which country does it best? Well, if you're a fan of socializing education and career trajectories, then China with its Zhongkao is probably at the top of the heap. If instead you like academic freedom and individual liberty, I'd be hard-pressed not to pick a Western country with a strong economy (e.g. US, UK, Germany). ",103,2017-12-20 19:07:53,AskAcademia
e7iambw,panchoop,t2_d1a5l,"I think your annoyance and exasperation is understandable, but it has no place in the academic/lab setting

You voluntarily gave your time to answer her questions, but this was done with no strings attached; she is not forced to continue working with you and you shouldn't be angry about it. She is free to change subjects, with the respective cost of doing so (writing new proposal, starting over, working with someone not so helpful, etc). Plans are constantly shifting and people should adapt to it.

From a practical standpoint,  don't try to pressure her, as then she might do a half-assed job at your project, and it could be even worse, as you will have to be over her ass for things to get done. Similarly, don't be hostile towards her (telling her that ""she should just work on another project""), building a hostile environment in a lab is a terrible thing to do, and will make a disservice to your own mental health. Have a sincere and friendly conversation on what she would like to do, and from then onwards decide a polite course of action.

In academia we are constantly doing things that are ""rewardless"", we review papers anonymously , we take PhD students that might fail for random reasons (or go to industry, gasp!), we help colleagues with their questions, we answer anonymous questions in reddit, etc. At the end, you have to decide what are you willing to do, and accept the losses of doing so.

Take this as a lesson, next time try to waste less time with your students, for instance teach them find answers by themselves or limit the questioning time (hey, I have just 30 minutes, what would you like to ask?).

And be kind to her, remember she is just starting and she doesn't really knows what are the implications of what she is doing, how it affects you, how your time is going to be wasted, etc. She just wants to be happy and follow a fulfilling research path that is in accordance with her interests.",98,2018-10-10 12:05:42,AskAcademia
embbsrf,Sickened_but_curious,t2_pdhpg,"Did you ever hear about ""publish or perish""?  

There is A LOT of pressure to publish as much as possible, which leads to a lot of problems. Work-Life balance is hard to maintain, since you will be often pushed to overwork (and work on weekends) in order to finish your project. Especially if there is a risk to be scooped, so someone else publishing similar results before you do. Collaborations between rivaling groups are not as common as you would probably expect, everyone wants that big publication for themselves.  
Mental health problems like depression are quite common as a result.

This can also lead to unhealthy competition, even within the lab, as everyone of course wants access to the best equipment.

Then you usually never really settle down and you will most likely never get a fixed contract that is not time restricted. What is instead expected of you is that you move every few years, publish constantly. Having a family is therefore also not that easy, especially for women. 

Becoming a professor is usually comparable to winning the Jackpot.   There are too few positions for too many people. This again leads to that publish or perish mentality. There are only few positions and you need to be outstanding in order to score one. This is usually measured by your output, so number of papers or even number of papers with a certain impact factor.

The pay also sucks, compared to industry jobs.

Jobs in industry are a good alternative but most people still treat leaving academics as a failure, even though it's usually a good choice. There you often get fixed hours, longer contracts and have chances to climb the company ladder for better job.",90,2019-05-02 13:24:28,AskAcademia

cof9t74,RPShep,t2_4td73,"This is the dark side of getting a PhD that not many people talk about. Depression, stress, and anxiety are part of the process, and nearly everyone getting a PhD goes through them for at least part of the time they are getting their degree. I did. People in my PhD cohort did. And frankly, some of them became overwhelmed and dropped out.

The people that *didn't* drop out did a few things:

1. Talk to a psychiatrist. If talking to one didn't work as you say, talk to a different one. Not everyone will click with every mental health professional.
2. Schedule your time mindfully. Getting a PhD requires that you are pulled in several different directions at once: teaching, research, comps, publishing, service, etc. Determine what is highest priority and when you are most productive. Schedule your high priority things during your productive time and less priority stuff in your less productive time. For example, I am most productive in the mornings, so I write and research during that time. I'm least productive in the afternoons, so that's when I teach and grade papers (some people hate when I say this, but frankly, teaching takes way less brain power than writing). Schedule this time *every day.*
3. Reward yourself when you are productive (but don't punish yourself when you're not). For example, if I can get a minimum of 4 hours of work done on an ""off"" day in the morning, I'll let myself play video games for the afternoon (then try to get a little more done in the evening). After a long day of teaching, I'll often go out to dinner with my wife or a friend (instead of trying to work more).
4. Create a network. I guarantee other people around you are going through the same thing. Hang out, have a few drinks, and complain about all this stuff. It really really helps. Don't be shy about saying that you're struggling. Other people around you will probably *appreciate* hearing they're not the only ones.

dlz0so4,Drbananabeak,,"Let me start by saying - I understand you wanting to take a gap year, however ""I worked hard for 5 and a half years"" is not going to be a very strong argument, because you know what? Most of us here who are actual academics and not students have been working ""non stop"" for at least 15+ years.

I honestly think your phD is not a good time to take a whole year out, depending on your funding, it may also be a complete impossibility, but here are some things I do think you should do:

- get mental health help to manage your anxiety. Anxiety doesn't have anything to do with you working many years in a row, and it may not get better by just taking a chunk of time out. Learn some techniques to manage the anxiety and keep it at bay.

- see if you can do a short volunteer project such as 6 weeks or so. You will be much more likely to get your supervisor to be ok with you taking a summer out and you will get the same experience. Most volunteer organisations are pretty terrible and the ""gap year"" organisation where you hug an orphan for 2 weeks and then travel through Uganda are an actual problem for the orphanages and a real source of distress to the orphans. Similarly some of the teaching companies have been heavily criticized for giving very subpar teaching to the ""poor children"" and feeling like heroes whilst doing it. There are however some efforts that are worth while - replenishing deforested areas with seeds for example. Look into things where you do not affect children's lives if possible (I feel very strongly about this having seen the damage done by volunteer companies when I spent a summer as a physician in sub-Saharan Africa).

- find something besides studying that you can do for the length of your phD (and beyond). A sport, a hobby, a craft or some local volunteering (there are soup kitchens everywhere! You don't need to go to Sierra Leone for it) - something that will help you through tough times because it is always there to keep your mind off things. Even if you take a gap year in 4 years time when you are getting ready to wrap up your thesis, a gap year will just be something you did a while ago and that won't recharge your batteries, whilst a hobby or volunteering locally will still be with you.",36,2017-08-22 15:55:20,AskAcademia

etaco20,asherdi,t2_75a91,"I would counter a couple of these arguments.

&gt; Compared to other highly educated people in the general population, PhD students are about 2.5 times more likely to be at risk for depression and other psychiatric disorders. About one in three end up with symptoms of a psychiatric disorder.

Yes, but it can be hard to disentangle causality here. Just because grad students and post-docs have mental health issues does not mean grad school/post-docs cause mental health issues. It seems to me that there are many reasons why people who are prone to mental health issues are likely to choose this kind of career. Furthermore, plenty of alternative careers have much worse work/life balance and mental health issues (e.g. investment banking), without the support structures and awareness that academia has.

&gt; If the postdoc goes into industry, their salary (~$48K/yr ) is still less than the median new college grad (~50K/yr) AND it's unlikely the private sector biology PhD will be able to continue doing research [4-5]. Indeed, if the postdoc sticks with research, they can expect to be paid less.

Yes, but the trade-off is the academic freedom you get as a researcher. Sure, you're paid less (although realistically, not that much less. NSF minimum post-doc salaries are ~$50k, which is a good salary). But during the time you spend in academia, you (broadly) get to pick who you work with, where you work, and what you work on. That's an incredible privilege, so it makes sense that lots of people are willing to take a pay cut in exchange for such a job.

&gt; Moreover, several studies agree that there isn’t any evidence a postdoc will actually benefit seekers of non-academic jobs [6-8]. When comparing private sector workers 10 years post-PhD, the salary of those who went the postdoc route are $12,000 lower than those who skipped postdocs altogether.

I totally agree that doing a post-doc is unlikely to be a good thing for your long-term salary. But I would hope that most people are aware of this, and choose to do a post-doc (and indeed a PhD) for other reasons. If money was our primary motivation, I'm sure most of us would have chosen a different path.

&gt; So if I encourage someone to go to grad school, I'm essentially putting them on a path toward some pretty dire consequences for their career, especially if they do a postdoc, which most will.

Plenty of grad students choose to leave academia. But even if they do a postdoc and then regret it, I really wouldn't count the consequences as 'dire'. Sure, it might not turn out to be the optimal route towards their ultimate career goal, but most people will make non-optimal decisions, or take a while to work out what they really want to do. Doing a post-doc, even if you don't end up going into academia, is hardly a 'bad' option in the grand scheme of things.

&gt; So how do you do it? How do we as mentors look our students in the eyes and tell them to ignore the statistics and persevere, hoping they'll be one of the few to buck the trends?

I think it's just as bad to go the other way, and tell students they're never going to make it because the odds aren't in their favour. Part of the job of an academic is to train the next generation of academics, and that doesn't happen if trainees are told the path is closed. Furthermore, socioeconomic disparities will only grow greater if only undergrads at the top institutions are told they can make it in academia. Just make sure that trainees are fully aware of the costs and benefits of the decisions they're making, and that they're aware of the options they have available.",35,2019-07-08 20:21:06,AskAcademia

e0lpjue,BangarangRufio,t2_40hnr,"&gt; I always tell my students to do their work, but watch TV/movies/listen to music- whatever- keep hobbies.

Having finished my phd only a year ago, I've unfortunately seen a few advisors steering their grad students in the opposite direction. For example: 

I led a first-year ""welcome to grad school; here's some tips to succeed""-style seminar during the last year of my program. As a tip, I suggested finding or keeping a hobby that students enjoy and sticking to a plan to indulge and enjoy time spent with this hobby a few hours each week to maintain sanity. I even made the caveat that there will be weeks where this may not be possible, but did say that work-life balance is difficult in a time-demanding job, so grad school is a good time to learn skills towards achieving whatever a healthy balance means for each person.

An advisor had been sitting in on that session and contradicted me in front of the first year students, saying that work-life balance is over rated and grad school is the only time in our lives that we will be able to devote ourselves to our studies fully. She said the answer to mental health isn't to ""just go bake a cake"", but to instead be better at our own research. I bit my tongue in the moment, because she had already written me a good letter of recommendation for the job I now have, but still fume over the side conversation we had later where I tried to calmly tell her that not everyone works like her and that it's okay to do so (spoiler: she disagreed and said that she will never regret spending so much time at work instead of with her family, and already regrets not spending more time at work and less with her family).

dukhtbk,Oseberg_shipping,t2_fm8w6,"Hi!! I struggled with depression and anxiety throughout graduate school. 

First thing is first, go see a mental health professional. Your school definitely has some on staff who will meet with you and help you get to the root of your anxiety/depression. They are bound by confidentiality rules, so you don’t have to worry about your coworkers finding out. Please please do this if you do nothing else.

The answer to your question really depends on why you are depressed. If it is because of environmental factors (toxic work environment etc), then the change of scenery that comes with leaving grad school may do it. Unfortunately depression and anxiety are tricky conditions and can have a really wide range of causes which mix and mingle. They can also linger long after their initial cause has subsided. Depression is particularly notorious for feeding back into itself. 

For me my depression was almost certainly hereditary. It was triggered or made worse by the stressful nature of grad school. By the time I finally sought help I was nearly incapable of focusing on anything, much less my work. Eventually I ended up on medication which didn’t solve the problem but gave me enough of a buffer that I could cope and begin to get better. 

Some things that were useful: 
Finding a hobby that is also a physical activity. Better yet if it’s a competitive or social sport (I recommend squash,
It’s easy to get started, and nearly every university has a squash culture). If you are always exhausted this may really help.

If you live in the northern part of the world some of your problem may be seasonal. Plenty about this online, consider it though.

Block off some you time in every week. Read a book that has nothing to do with your field, cook something, go out with friends. 

Go on vacation (easier said than done as a grad student). I suggest extending travel for conferences, most departments won’t care if you take a flight back a few days later.

And above all, seek professional help.

1. *Are you comfortable talking about your scars?*   
You don't need to go into any detail you're not comfortable with or respond with complete truth and openness (which is totally not required), but if someone doesn't recognize them as self-harm and asks ""Oh! What happened?!"", can you deal with that and manage the situation such that neither you, nor the asker, leave feeling suuuuper awkward about it? If you're not there yet, can you think of a script that will work, and or steel your emotions for that possibility?


2. *Have you successfully dealt with the issues that led you to self harm or do you have a proactive self-care plan if these issues remain?*  
You don't have to be totally healthy, but if it comes up (for your own sake as well as to respond to the concern of your colleagues), it'll put a lot of minds at ease if you mention that you have a support system, therapist, medication, change in circumstance from whatever triggered you, etc. Again, there's no need for you to be transparent and truthful, but we'll want to know/hear you aren't about to be adrift and in distress.

Speaking as faculty, though not one who's had to deal with this before, my primary response would be protective. I would want you to be OK. 

I would also want to make sure that you're not too emotionally sensitive right now to work with others or in a high stress field.

g5d5811,Opulent_Grapefruit,t2_7pds5n8g,"I totally get it! A few things from a fellow medication user who still frequently copes with focusing issues...

(1) Exercise!

I know there are studies out there to back it up, but I'm not going to go down a rabbit hole to find them since I only have a few minutes left on my Pomodoro timer. I find that I am ***so*** much more focused when I go for a run/bike ride in the morning. There are days when I convince myself I ""don't have time"" to exercise for 20 minutes and then spend the day kicking myself because I waste waaaay more than 20 minutes trying to find focus.

(2) Pomodoro timer

25 minutes of intense, focused studying/5 minute break. There are plenty of apps for this (I use Focus Keeper but also occasionally Seconds Pro which is actually a timer for HIIT exercise lol). Play around with the time intervals and see what works for you, then STICK TO IT and treat it like it's a law you can't break. The minute that break ends, get back to work.

(3) Foam ear plugs underneath noise cancelling headphones

If you have over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones, invest in a large container of foam earplugs. This + noise cancelling + brown noise (personally find it way more tolerable than white noise...buy a track of your choice and play it on repeat) are a MUST. COVID has seriously screwed up my finely honed work habits, but this helped immensely.

(4) Freedom App

I found this really useful as well. There are days where no matter how much I tried, I could NOT get myself off time-wasting websites. There's a free version you can try, but it basically blocks whatever apps and websites you want on all your devices and there's an option you can choose so that there's no way to un-do it until the session is over. I have these set up for repeating sessions throughout the day, which helps keep me focused.

(5) Positive talk

Ok, ok, this one might sound cheesy but it's real. Tell yourself over and over that you are good at working from home/with distraction/etc until you believe it. Take it from someone who had a few breakdowns early on in the pandemic... you have to acknowledge what you're  feeling and how crummy the situation is, but then decide that you're stronger than that, and get back to work.

(6) Stick with a schedule

This one is another crucial one. Set boundaries for yourself. Working from home has made it difficult for everyone...now all of a sudden you're expected to be available via email/zoom/etc at all hours because they know you haven't gone anywhere. I stick with a schedule of when I'm going to work, and when I'm going to call it quits. There is ALWAYS more work to be done, so don't fool yourself into thinking that you have to work for just one more hour. You could work forever and you probably wouldn't be done/caught up.

(7) Know when to take a break

If you set up a schedule and get into a rhythm, but then find that there are days when you **just can't focus** no matter what you do? Call it quits. Trying to force yourself to do work is going to make you miserable, and is just going to cause you to burn out more/be less efficient/repeat the cycle. Take the day off, do something you find truly relaxing and enjoyable, get some exercise, then start again the next day. It's probably a good practice to do this once a week or so....as you go, you'll start to figure out what time span you need between days off. For me, it's around the 9 day mark that I start to crack and know I need to take a day off, so I just build it into my schedule one day before that happens.

do9n52t,foibleShmoible,,"I've got to say, it sounds really odd that an adult (which I assume this younger person is, since they are in the latter stages of a PhD) apparently needs another adult (are you their father?) to step in and hire someone to get them to do their own work.

I fully understand the difficulties involved in focusing on getting a thesis done, as do institutions in general. This is why, as other people have said, they usually have writing centres and other programmes designed to help students. I personally serve as a thesis mentor (this is a university run, volunteer filled, free service) to provide someone outside of the student's department who is there to provide moral support/general encouragement/someone just to check in with.

However, some of the things you're asking for
&gt; They might suggest other lines of thought, discuss arguments and counter-arguments, and do content editing of the resulting work.

in my opinion overstep the mark. While a student may develop their ideas through discussions with their advisor and colleagues, at the writing up stage *paying* someone to come up with ideas (which is effectively the same as suggesting other lines of thought) feels unethical. Meanwhile content editing, as opposed to proof reading, again feels far too heavy handed to be done by anyone other than a student's advisor who would (should) know where advising ends and taking over begins. I would not trust that to be the case with whoever got hired.

Really, just from what you've written, I suspect that this student is actually getting the appropriate amount of support, but they lack the motivation/will/ability (delete as appropriate) to get through this without having their hand held the entire way. And given that the point of doing a PhD is to become an independent researcher, requiring this level of (paid) support at this stage makes me wonder whether they should be getting a PhD. And I wouldn't be surprised if they expect a lot of hand holding, if they've had someone in their life (talking about you buddy, the person trying to hire someone to drag them through their PhD) doing it frequently.

Unless you've missed things out (health (inc. mental) issues, disability, other extenuating circumstances) then the resources typically provided by advisors, departments, institutions, and just the internet, should be sufficient for them to sort themselves out if they set their mind to it. Which is exactly what they need to do, not just hire someone to make them do it.

You either need to inform her you can no longer fulfill your duty (which is a perfectly acceptable thing to do), or bite the bullet and stick to the positives. Look at her CV or ask her for a quick interview if you need help. Your university's office that aids with student employment should have resources to help guide you through this process.

If the choice was mine, I would never move out, get married, have kids, work a 9-5, and all those other adults things. If it was up to me, I'd just sit and play Fortnite all day. It isn't even necessarily because I'm lazy, either; the adult world just **does not interest me at all.** I seriously hate that I'm this way, because I look around me at all the other kids my age who are passionate about research and actually doing something with their lives, and **I just feel so lost and unmotivated.** It's like, the kinds of things that interest or concern me are things you might expect from a 12-year-old. I only take life seriously because I don't want to end up homeless or broke. I don't understand the people who genuinely enjoy doing classwork and making a career for themselves, but I wish I did. I wish so badly I was that way, because **I feel so utterly worthless as I am now.**


&gt; **Nothing excites or interests me** these days besides Fortnite. I used to (and still do, to some extent) enjoy writing, but even that is something I'm losing the willpower to do. Life just sucks, and I have no clue how to make myself care. I feel like such a piece of shit for basically lying to my professors, making them believe I actually care about academia. In reality, I'm just doing it to make a good impression and because (at least in the case of some of them) I genuinely like them as people and want to be their friend.

It is (in my opinion) the toughest form of PhD as you are all on your own. You also get a taste of what it is going to be like if you became an academic as there won't be anyone telling you what to do. 
You have to come up with ideas and hypothesis to test, read, collect data from previous work, do stats on then and lay a solid foundation for your next step. 

If you don't know what to do next, it just means you haven't read enough around your field. 

I know it is easier said than done and goodness knows how taxing it is on mental health. But that is how it is sometimes.

No one knows more than I do about the pressures of women faculty. However, I'm also married to a therapist who has educated me on many aspects of mental health, and my family has been touched quite a bit by clinical depression. There are multiple factors that are involved in depression, certainly the situation plays a huge role, but ultimately it is a treatable illness. I'm sorry this happened to your friend. 

If there is one piece of advice that I might add to yours, it's to be flexible and to try earlier. I see so many young people struggling because they are trying to make a bad situation work out, or work an impossible ""career plan"". If you don't get along with your post-doc mentor in the first month, you won't by the end of your third year. So much of success in this field depends on ephemeral connections with people. Make people earn your trust, don't give it away. And finally, always look for opportunity, you might have a five year plan, but it never hurts to look, to put your name out there, to apply, no matter what your peer and mentors think, or what your personal plan is. You will never find an opportunity if you are not looking for it. There are so few positions out there, the perfect one might be found now, and gone by the time you apply in the next year.

Yes, academia has its own unique forms of stress and pressure, but lower education has similar ones and more. 

Additionally,  depending on the school, district, and whether it's public or private, you may not get to engage intellectually with literature. The school I taught heavily discouraged teaching literature because of Common Core standards (this was a mess to work through sometimes) and pressures around state testing. Not the least student interest in literature (which varied wildly). If it's a private school, it's a different matter, but it also comes with its own unique stressors and problems.

ea98p04,riotsqurrl,t2_zn356,"Grad students are expected to bring in some measure of their own ideas (how much varies based on their PI) but must generally align with their PIs work enough to be helpful to the group's overall aims. You're not an independent worker like a Postdoc, who collaborates with the PI on themes but can define their own scope to a much broader extent. You're a trainee who is receiving instruction in ""how to science"". An advanced trainee, but a trainee nonetheless. Your first goal has to be to publish as much as possible, your second goal is to get your thesis done in a reasonable time. All of this is assuming you'll want a job that requires a productive PhD afterwards (if not, why are you doing one?)

Your PI is pointing you to ""buzzy"" topics because that'll get you published and accepted into conferences. It's possible of course that they're on a total ego-trip, but it's more likely they have a lot of experience in how their field works and they know when to jump on trends that align with their field. 

Regarding your own ideas, how much reading around have you done in the three months you've been there? How much longer do you think you'll need? I would suggest you start on your PIs idea, maybe with a quick paper that won't take a lot of time or thought, depending on how possible that is in your field. In the meantime you can do your extra reading, and find something that will work you without totally ignoring the work your PI wants you to do. Once you decide what you want to do, pitch a paper outline to your PI. Think about these timelines (PI pet paper done by when? Your pet paper outline done by when?) and discuss with your PI now whether that works for them. If they shoot you down completely, perhaps it's time to find somewhere else to study.

So, here is where the ""advanced"" from ""advanced trainee"" comes in. You need to take responsibility for your timelines and your productivity. You can't spend many more months simply reading, you gotta start doing (unless you're in a country that requires grad courses, in which case a lot of the early time will be taken up with those and reading is probably all you can fit in). Your PhD will likely change and morph while you're doing it. I'm *not* saying ""rush headlong into anything and everything"" but I am saying ""do a thing while you try and think of a better one"". PhD work happens in parallel, not in sequence.

There's a caveat with this though: PhDs are mentally and emotionally exhausting affairs. They are marathons of hard work and self-doubt, and they require resilience and self-care (in the eat well/sleep well/exercise sufficiently-kind of way). If your mental health is suffering significantly only three months in, you should consider either how to mitigate that or whether a PhD is for you.

(Note: I think it's appalling that PhDs are structured in a way that make some students' lives an absolute misery and I think change is necessary, and soon. I'm giving this advice based on the reality of the current situation, not because I subscribe to a ""if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen"" mentality.)",22,2018-11-22 20:50:34,AskAcademia
dlz0owo,penguinberg,,"I am in the same position you are regarding being in a STEM PhD program at a high ranking university. I have anxiety that flares up in particular when I am doing lab work, both last summer at a national lab internship and now here in grad school.

I'm not a psychologist and I'm certainly not you, but I know that if I were to take a year off, I would feel better (anxiety-wise) for the year, and then everything would come flooding back when I returned. My anxiety (and I imagine yours as well) is not the result of being in grad school or working straight through undergrad into grad school, but the result of certain ways of thinking my entire life: the way I was raised, the expectations I put on myself in my schoolwork and labwork, that sort of thing. To change those things and work on improving my anxiety, the things that help are (1) talking to somebody, like a therapist or a friend even, and (2) going back into lab and working through the issues one day at a time. [Edit: (3) Doing the things you mentioned here, like teaching or volunteering, once or twice a week as a way to relieve stress.]

Ultimately, I think there's a difference between taking a two-week vacation meant to relieve some of the stress of work and take a ""mental health day"" so to speak, versus taking a year off and ignoring the things that give you anxiety.

dwvr172,restricteddata,t2_8brve,"If you were a student of mine, here's what I would say:

1. This sort of thing happens more often than you might think. You're not a freak and you're not ruining your life. Literally nobody will care if you graduate a semester later than normal. In the long run it will be just a tiny blip in the story of your life. I know this is hard thing to see now, but you'll get past this and it won't be as much drama as it feels like right now.

2. You should spend some time talking to the mental health people who your campus no doubt makes available to you. There need not be any stigma attached to this. In my experience literally _everyone_ in the United States has either had some sort of mental issue themselves at one point (or many points) in their lives, or their close relatives and/or partners have. It's more common than it is uncommon. It is especially common at high-stress places like universities. There are resources available for you. Take advantage of them. Don't try to do this on your own.

3. As for the academic and graduation and etc., you should talk to your Dean of Undergraduate Affairs (or something similarly named). This is part of their job, usually. They have seen this same situation a trillion times already. Probably a dozen times this semester alone! They will know what the answers are. Sometimes it is not a great answer, like ""well, you'll have to retake another semester."" That's not ideal but it honestly is not the end of the world. Sometimes there are better answers, like, ""if you take classes X and Y over the summer, and class Z at a local community college next fall, you can walk this fall but you won't get your degree until next year."" I am just making that example up but things like that have been used here to help students graduate and avoid paying another semester's worth of full tuition. There are also often ways to avoid having a semester full of Fs (e.g. they can convert them to incompletes or withdrawals or whatever). It is unlikely that they can just wave a wand and fix your final semester — but who knows, there may be options. But you need to reach out to them. I would do this AFTER you talk to the mental health professionals, as it is a lower priority than getting some control of your personal situation.

IN SHORT: This is way more common than it probably feels, and there are probably well-established local resources to help you with them. Seek them out. If you're totally at sea, go to your favorite, nicest professor and ask for help in figuring out who you should talk to.

Your description of brain fog, and just *not being able to even read words on the page* feels uncomfortably familiar to me.  


But! It doesn't have to be this hard. You don't have to--and shouldn't--just muscle through this without help. I found that actually USING my university's mental health resources was essential to getting myself through my program.   


One-off therapy sessions with the school therapists were enough to get me over the wall and through whatever project I was stuck on. The sessions were often frustrating and unideal, but they were better than nothing, and, when I needed them most, they were enough.   


If you CAN set up an appointment for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, specifically, at a local clinic, that would be my best recommendation. These sessions are very different than talk therapy, and focus on developing specific strategies to help untangle and work through disruptive, anxious intrusive thoughts. You can learn how to make them stop--not all the time, but often. You can also look up Cognitive Behavioral worksheets and self-guided practice online. It honestly is the one form of therapy that I can say permanently changed the way I experience the world.

The second path is to focus on teaching and do research on the side at a small liberal arts college (SLAC).

I got my BS in chemistry and went straight into a combined masters/PhD program in physical chemistry which ended up taking me 5 years. I absolutely loved my advisor and the research that I was doing. I graduated at the ripe age of 27 and found a job at a small teaching college where I started teaching full time a month after I defended my dissertation. I have the latitude to develop my classes the way I want and offer them at the times that I want within reason. There isn't an expectation for publications but undergraduate research projects are encouraged. I'm currently in my second year and starting a small research project with 2 students while teaching a full load of classes and I love it!

Not every story about grad school is a negative one but the negative ones tend to make their voices louder (there may also be more of them). Every advisor is different and the trick is to find one who you fit well with. I didn't mesh well with my first advisor and I switched after a year.

It must be her decision to let her supervisor know anything about herself. She has taken the initial steps (been to the counseling etc) but she didn't see the doctor again? I think the most important thing is to go on with the treatment. Her mental health is important than anything, as a friend you should tell her that it is hard to overcome this without the treatment options. Depression is not joke or simple thing. You can tell her that it might be good to talk to her advisor about her situation as well.

I don't get this attitude, I've never seen a student who can be motivated for 24/7. Sometimes you need to step away from the work, it doesn't mean you need to quit everything. She doesn't need to get a paper in Nature to graduate, her supervisor's duty is to guide her to get her degree in the graduate school (it is still a learning process). If he is not able to do his advisor duties, he needs to help her to find another supervisor, but she has to prioritize her own health and realize that she can't graduate just depending on her supervisor's generousity.",20,2018-06-06 06:34:10,AskAcademia
glkw522,goatsnboots,t2_rswxz,"Yes! I do! This question was made for me.


I have been tracking every minute since the start of my PhD two years ago. Note that my contract states 35 hours a week, and this means 35 hours sitting at my desk available to work. I also started off using the pomodoro technique, but even if I stuck to that religiously, I'd only actually work 5:50 a day. Then you factor in some longer bathroom breaks, chats with coworkers, waiting for meetings to start, etc. and my median work hours per day for the past two years are 4:25. Pretty bad. 


That being said, look at my days without pomodoro and it's a pretty wide mix. There were days that I sat at my desk for 7 hours and did 2 hours of work because I was so unmotivated (I should also note that attendance is pretty strict here, otherwise I would have just taken that as a mental health day). There are of course some days that I worked longer. My record is 12:42 one day, doing actual work. That was during a 3-week period where I think I was pulling off 60-70 hours a week before a deadline. Obviously, I did not do pomodoro those weeks. 


The bottom line is work the way that's best for you. Sure, pomodoro means that you'll work a little less. But working 4 hours a day with pomodoro is better than 2 hours a day without. Also, don't limit yourself to that system. If your alarm goes off and you don't feel like you need to take a break, do that.


Also, for what it's worth, everyone who doesn't track their time inflates their hours. I have a colleague who complains about working until 10pm or midnight every day. And I guarantee I work more than he does in my 7-hour shift. He might be physically at the office for 11 hours, but I see him at his desk maybe 2 hours before I go home. Some people need to move around a lot and take lots of long breaks, which is okay too, but know when you might need to fix that in order to be productive.


Edit: I count everything in my numbers - meetings, grading, etc.",20,2021-02-01 09:03:55,AskAcademia
drtky0i,abandoningeden,,"I have generalized anxiety disorder.  Actually it seems to have really died down since I got tenure last year, but I'm not sure if that's permanent, since it's died down for a few years at a time before.  

Here's what the tenure track looked like for me:  In grad school I started seeing a therapist for anxiety because I started having full blown anxiety attacks about once a week in my second year.  This was partially related to my disillusionment with my advisor who kinda stole some ideas from my MA thesis and put them in his book which he then had me edit.  Anyway those panic attacks lasted about a year, I wen to therapy, started making some other general changes in my life (including switching birth control which I think was related) and the panic attacks stopped. Also at this time I got a prescription for xanax for use as needed.  

In my 4th year of grad school I started teaching and got so nervous  I would forget the english language. So for the first month of my first class I took about a quarter pill of xanax about 45 minutes before each class. After that I didn't need it- except for the first class of the semester the next semester, and the one after that.  I also wrote out careful scripts for each lesson plan so I can read off a page if I forget how to speak.

In my fifth year of grad school I went on the market.  I didn't get a job.  The next year I went on the market and I did get a job. For 2 years my stomach hurt and I had um, butt problems as a result of anxiety constantly.  At the interview for my job I threw up from anxiety the first night at the hotel, and again the next morning. That was the first time I threw up from anxiety.

My first semester on the job I did fine until around October, when my grandfather died.  I didn't go to the funeral because I would have had to cancel my graduate class and I was freaking out (now I know this wouldn't have been an issue at all but I was new and too anxious to ask anyone for accommodations).  The depression over that + the anxiety over my first semester started hitting me hard around that. I started throwing up 3-5 times a week, always right before leaving my house for work.  I would throw up and 15 minutes be sitting in a faculty meeting, or meeting up with a new colleague for coffee ( I always threw up before the 'let's meet up for coffee' meetings everyone has your first semester). 

My first winter break I didn't work at all to try and recover from the anxiety.  I stopped throwing up because I wasn't going to work, and after that I didn't throw up for a few years!  

My fourth year on the tenure track I had a kid.  Right before I gave birth I sent out several papers for review, and got 3 r and rs right after giving birth.  One of them had a 6 week deadline but I didn't notice that until 2 weeks before it was due.  I tried to finish the revision, but couldn't and missed the deadline.  That was going to be the last paper I needed to get tenure (we need 5 articles for tenure, this was #5) so after I missed the deadline I started obsessing over not getting tenure.  This was late December. I told myself I would finish the paper anyway and send it back out, late, with an apology, before my maternity leave ended and the next semester started.  My anxiety over this ramped up to the point where I ended up staying up working all night, every night, for over a week, to try and finish this stupid paper- which was physically impossible, especially after not sleeping for a week. At the end I started experience hallucinations and ended up in a mental hospital for 10 days for ""Post partum psychosis/post partum anxiety."" So that was fun.  In the end I sent the revision in 3 months late and it got rejected.  I ended up doing no work that Spring semester or Summer as I basically worked to recover my mental health. Over spring break that spring we also had a 5 day blackout after an ice storm, and I had a huge 4 day panic attack since we had a 7 month old baby, and started throwing up again. Luckily I was already in therapy after the mental hospital stint, so I just adjusted my meds. I ended up going on daily anti anxiety meds.  I tapered off them a year and a half later during my 5th year on the tenure track.  Going off them was also an adventure and destroyed a lot of my productive time. 

Very shortly after that, In my 6th year it was the last year before going up for tenure (I delayed by a year when I had a kid).  At the beginning of the year I still had only 4 papers published- and 2 r and rs.  After my previous r and r had been rejected (first and only time that has happened to me) I started stressed that my other r and rs would get rejected, and I wouldn't have enough articles to get tenure.  So I started throwing up again.  

Around Fall of my 6th year both those papers got accepted, and that was pretty much the last time I had bad anxiety issues. I have thrown up maybe twice since then- one the day of my department tenure vote (unanimous yes) and one the day I played ukulele in front of hundreds of people on my brother's wedding.  Other than that, it's been a year and a half of good mental health.  I have actually found I have gotten way MORE productive since getting tenure because I spend so much less time being stressed out and managing my stress! 

So yeah that got long.  I'm not sure what I'm after here either, but that's my experience.  ",19,2017-12-27 16:08:32,AskAcademia
g54fyd1,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"First of all, although your individual circumstances may vary from others, your overarching concern (""I have this intellectual passion and there are few viable career options within it"") is one shared by many. Ultimately, part of a liberal arts education is about how you learn to think critically, write, etc. in ways that ultimately are applied to a variety of careers.

I have two suggestions for you:

1. Prioritize your mental health. You don't say whether you're still in therapy, but if not, I encourage you to go back. Going beyond specific diagnoses and medications, I imagine that working with a therapist on exploring this crossroads in your life and on enhancing your self-confidence / not putting yourself down so much may be helpful. You also note that you have ADD; some of your concerns are very common among people with ADD. (That is, you are a bright individual who makes some brilliant connections, yet also struggle with things like organization and time management, and feel guilty and low on yourself as a result.) If you are not already in therapy, you may see if you can find a therapist who specializes in working with adults with ADHD. All of this is a long-winded way of saying: I think working to more effectively manage your mental health concerns may help you to be in a space in which you can more effectively plan and work toward some long-term goals.

2. Your college should have some sort of career center. Use their services! Some things a career center can do for you now include providing career assessment to help you to identify potential areas of interest, and helping you to identify potential jobs and occupations that overlap with your interests, including some potential fields that you may not have heard of or thought about before. For example, as someone interested in intellectual pursuits, there are far more less known options than professor or teacher, just as for someone interested in healthcare or helping others, there are career options other than becoming a doctor. Also use the Career Center's services next year when you are applying for jobs (or sooner, as you apply for summer internships, etc.), schedule appointments well in advance to get feedback about your cover letter and resume/CV. Many career centers will also do interview practice. Figuring out what you want to do next that feels realistic for where you're at now is something that is scary for most students, and you may both benefit from some guidance from professionals who know their stuff, and just knowing that you're not going through the process alone.

I'll also note that, for all of your struggles, you're doing OK. You are thinking about job and career prospects at a time when many students have not yet thought as much about these things. Your GPA, while not the highest, is likely about average for your institution. (Also: as you note you are attending a selective institution, know that you are surrounded by high achieving folks and it can sometimes be difficult to see just how much you have and are accomplishing when ""achievement"" is the water that everyone seems to be swimming in.) I know that you don't feel a lot of hope now. Certainly, at least some of your pessimism is grounded in awareness of some very real personal and professional challenges that exist. But I do not think things are as gloomy as you think they are, and I think that if you take the time now to explore future options and plan for a future career that meets you where you are at, you will be able to find something that you like.",19,2020-09-13 15:43:41,AskAcademia
cvh94gv,prhodian,t2_9kk56,"Hiya. As far as I can tell, universities are rife with mental health issues.  I certainly struggled with depression/stress and anxiety towards the end of my undergraduate career.  So, I left and got a job.  Still kept up some links with areas of interest and kept on studying in my own time and at my own pace. Nearly 20 years later, my mental health is much more stable and I am working on a masters dissertation and collaborating on a paper with my tutor and have another paper published with me as sole author, and I am loving it. I'm a much better student for having waited, and possibly happier in myself than some of those who went straight into grad school.

dsev9sa,bosanovanine,t2_oxsks,"Sorry to hear about those difficulties. 

This kind of dysfunction is quite common, both within academia and in other professions too. It can be and in fact usually is very demoralising to work in such an environment and I can understand why you're feeling a bit depressed. 

I am in such an environment myself, albeit with some differences, and would make the following observations, some of which might be helpful - 
1) these things tend to happen in cycles. A dysfunctional department can often turn itself around with the right hire or a few retirements. So what is true there now might not be true in the future. I don't think that having people there for a long time is itself an indicator that there are problems. By far the most difficult people I work with are new hires actually.

2) it is important not only to be insulated but also to insulate yourself. For example you have clearly been told that a prospective hire in the department turned it down because of three of the staff. I'm not sure where you heard that but it would seem very unusual to me that a graduate student would be made aware of that kind of sensitive HR information. Whoever told you that is not acting in your best interests. I'm not saying you've done anything wrong  but I found in my own workplace that I was being fed a lot of gossip by people and while I was glad to hear a lot of that information I ultimately found that it meant that I was part of the problem. I needed to start distancing myself from those people and to stop listening to and repeating toxic information. It doesn't really do anyone any good to know this kind of stuff, and the only reason we like it is because knowledge is a form of currency in a workplace, and thus a form of power. So it might be worth your while putting some distance between yourself and whoever is feeding you this info.  

3) In other words, question the extent to which you yourself might be contributing to any toxicity. In a demoralised department people spread gossip and mistruths, often not even realising they are doing it. Speculation gets turned into established fact simply through repetition, people are scapegoated for broader problems, and you come home feeling bad about things. I don't know what the three people in your department are guilty of, but would say that while I have known academics who were absolutely horrible to work with, I am also aware of situations where good people were undone by character assassination motivated by jealousy. It might be helpful to question whether you have evidence that these people are as bad as is claimed. If so, does that really affect you directly? Maybe it does, but if it doesn't try to ignore it. 

4) Ultimately I think that this kind of work environment is something that probably most academics are going to have to deal with at some stage in their careers, though with varying degrees of severity. I think if you can find a way to protect yourself, and make sure you are not adding to the toxicity, then you are probably developing a good set of skills that will be of use to you as your career develops. 

5) Having said that, some situations are just not retrievable and if you genuinely feel that you are in a place that is exceptionally bad - and if you genuinely feel that your mental health is at risk if you stay there - and if you are sure that you can go somewhere else and thrive there - then certainly do that. 

For me though, albeit that I'm a member of faculty in a dysfunctional place rather than a graduate student, my strategy has been to find a way to live with it, to keep my distance, and to try to make sure I'm making things better rather than worse where possible. That means treating everyone with as much respect as possible, not listening to gossip, seeking evidence for any assertions about people that I do hear, and trying to focus on the positive elements of the job. 

Good luck with it and sorry again that you are having to deal with this. Most people I know have had to face something like this in their careers, but it's a pity that you're dealing with it as a graduate student. ",19,2018-01-09 11:44:05,AskAcademia
fndduuv,oooomgg,t2_48fb8stv,"I agree with this in theory - from a mental health perspective - but I would argue that, with any graduate school, you need to do the degree for the career. 

If you just have an interest in a subject, you can study that on your own time, while you have a job, without taking the huge opportunity cost of lost income from being in a PhD. The best PhD stipends are around $40,000 in high COL areas, and I would think that if you're well spoken and well written enough to get into a PhD program, you can also get a well-paying job.

2. Land the plane. Work out how much funding you have left and think about how much work there is left and try to get them to match. Cut out what won't fit. Better to have a good, polished thesis on time than a great one which is late and a nightmare to write. No one other than your examiners are going to read it, so just get it done.

Best decision ever.  If I hadn't gone outside my focus, I never would've landed a wonderful tenure-track job with great colleagues and enthusiastic students.

I like the work-life balance working at a smaller school.  I only have to be on campus four days a week, and they really seem to care about things like maternity/paternity leave.  The pay is less, but the overall benefits to my mental health are worth it.

Another bit of advice is to not just listen to your PI.  They know the job they have - PI at research university.  My PI looked down on my desire to work at a community college, not realizing how they have changed over the last decade.  He said I had to do a post-doc to get on at a good university (maybe I wouldn't have had to apply to as many jobs, but I was able to start on the tenure track at 29, which is earlier than any of my friends in the US), but I knew I did not want to do a post-doc.

&gt; Do I leave? Do I stick it out? I don't know what to do. 

Unfortunately, now isn't the time to be making these decisions because you don't know what your options are - if the committee is meeting to see what it is they want to do, you have to wait until they *tell* you what you can choose to do. As you point out, they may make the decision for you. In the meantime, I would talk to your major advisor (assuming you're not in some field where you're doing rounds or enter as a cohort and pick later) and, more importantly, go talk to a mental health professional(s) that addresses *all* of your problems, because you're clearly ignoring some things.

No one cares. As long as you're above the threshold to have the credits count, no one gives a shit. Hell, the professors barely care about teaching those classes.

I found my first year really tough mentally— and I thought I was really prepared since I already had an MA in my field and work experience!  I remember being in tears after my first class, unsure if I would be able to survive the program.  Things got better, but it has definitely been tough at times. If you look on the grad school subreddit, you’ll find a lot of people with depression and anxiety issues, problems with their PIs, advisors, etc.  I’m not saying that grad school is the soul-crushing, anxiety-inducing world it’s often made out to be on that subreddit, but it certainly can be. 

Physically things can take a toll on you too. I have a colleague who has had some major health issues, and he is currently weighing dropping out entirely and/or taking an extended leave. It’s been really disheartening, and while the department has been in general very supportive, well, he can’t make reasonable deadlines due to the health issues. 

Another thing to consider— what are your long term goals?  What will you do with a PhD?  I only ask because even though I finished my PhD, I wish I had known more of the options available to me with just a BA or MA in my field— there are many more options than I thought of.  I thought I HAD to get a PhD or I would have no job options. And honestly, with the situation for employment these days, I think I might have had better luck without the PhD and looking at slightly different (but related) jobs.  Moot point for me now, I just wish I had done more research/been more honest with myself about my life goals. 

I don’t want to discourage you from pursuing graduate education, only for you to walk into it with eyes wide open. You’re often signing up for years of hard work for little pay (if you’re lucky enough to be paid— paying for it is another issue that I’ll leave others to discuss), having to put relationships and/or family on hold, moving every couple of years to pursue research/post-docs/jobs, and facing a tough job market when you finally finish.

New boss was very sympathetic but went on with the project; it turned out the project crashed and burned because old boss wanted to micromanage everything there too! New boss came and asked me how to deal with him and didn’t get mad when I said “I told you so”. Old boss’s colleagues in the field drifted away from him as they realised the extent of his toxicity, and survivors groups popped up from his ex students and employees.

Being neurodiverse feels like being told to drive on a road when everyone else has a car and you have a boat. I don't have a best strategy for you to manage ADD and mental health, but I will say that progress/success was never meant to be linear. Also, the meaningfulness of your life pursuits doesn't have to be tied to how productive they are. It seems like you'd be passionate about literature in both a pursuing-it-professionally and a non-career related context. So maybe your career doesn't have to be your ""one true passion""?

You definitely have time. Your last two years of grades are wayy more important than the first two. You still have the option of going for a master's degree and then having further time to decide how right academia is for you, and a few summers left as an undergrad to try and find internships that could point you in the right direction.",17,2020-09-13 15:53:09,AskAcademia

gd8k4l4,littleirishpixie,t2_x3ghy,"Yep. Did my Masters as a Mom whose husband was overseas for 1/2 of it, got a divorce at the beginning of my PhD program and did the rest of my PhD as a single Mom. It's hard but doable. My tips:  


1. First of all, whatever deadlines your professor lists, your personal deadline is 2 days earlier to prepare for whatever crisis might occur like sick kids or trips to the ER when your kid decides to jump off the top of the monkey bars. No crisis? Great! Then you have another chance to proofread your work. This saved my ass quite a few times. I utilize reminders in my phone/calendar and I don't even list the real date. I didn't want to know. I would check it if a crisis came up to see how much more time I had but otherwise, it didn't exist. 
2. Set a schedule and make it clear to your family that these are your work times. Barring crises (like the ones listed above), your family recognizes these as off-limits. They don't make plans during these times and should assume that they are on duty for the family responsibility. It's a lot easier on them if it's consistent. After my divorce, this involved grandparents stepping in to give me that study time. 
3. Self-grace. Sometimes the house won't be as clean as you want and that's fine. Sometimes dinner will be take out and it is what it is. If you are a meal planner and can freeze things, cool. If not, forgive yourself and watch your waistline. (I was a size 6 when I started my PhD program and left as a size 12. I gained 50 lbs during those 4 years that I'm still working to take it off...  it's going, but not nearly as fast as I would like it to!). Hopefully your partner respects how much you can do and is holding up their end too. Just be honest and upfront about what you can do and stick to that. If you have to get creative with solutions, do it (I hired a maid to come clean once every other week at one point). These things are okay. You don't have to carry the weight of the world. 
4. Learn how to say no to good things. Like the Mom friends who make you feel guilty for not doing playdates/Mom nights or volunteering. If you choose school, school and family are your focus, period. If you choose to do those extra things, it should be for your relaxation and mental health, not to appease people. People who don't understand and respect your ""no""  lose the privilege of being in your life. It's harsh but you do get a good sense of who respects your boundaries and who doesn't. 
5. Find a group of friends in your program who ""get it."" Your family won't. They may be supportive but they can't possibly understand what it looks like for you. Having your people is about the best thing I can say for your mental health. 
6. Learn how to break down work into smaller pieces so that you can utilize times when you would be sitting around doing nothing. Example: I used to meticulously outline my papers in advance so then when I had 20 minutes of downtime, I could focus on just one paragraph and take that off my plate (and believe me, these add up to having a mostly-done paper that just needs some editing). Or I could bang out one discussion post. Focus is a little harder (and I have ADHD so believe me when I say this) but if you already pre-plan it, it doesn't require a lot of deep thinking to prove what you already decided should be included in advance. And of course, revise it later. I wrote my entire dissertation at my kid's lacrosse practices. I think this was the biggest change I made. In undergrad, I wrote all of my papers in 5 hour marathons. In graduate school, I did most of my work in small chunks. I never realized how much time I was wasting ""waiting"" for things like standing beside the stove bored while I was waiting for the spaghetti to cook, sitting in a waiting room, sitting in the school pickup line, etc. I realized that if I added those up, it gave me hours and hours of extra work time. 

People who don't respect your decision can get over it. My former in laws spent every family gathering telling me how selfish I was for being in school and working in general because I guess it's my job as a woman to let my life revolve around my husband. We obviously weren't going to see eye to eye on basically anything. (And these people all have pretty miserable marriages so I wasn't heartbroken that they didn't think we were matching their standards). It took me maybe a year of that to politely say ""I'm glad that's working for you all. That's not what we chose. Now moving on..... (insert subject change here)"" 

Sidenote: I sort of hate your headline here because why on earth don't we ask fathers the same thing? (I'm not critiquing or judging you for your wording. It is what it is. But it makes me sad to rarely see men ask these questions and we as a society rarely expect them to.)",16,2020-11-22 17:30:18,AskAcademia
clfk2eh,zazzlekdazzle,t2_4x68b,"This is sort of a meta response, and I hope it contributes to what you want to find out.  I am not sure if the actual quitters are always the best people to ask.  From the outside, I have seen many people both actually quit before finishing or, in most cases, sort of give up the ghost somewhere along the way and just drag themselves over the finish line while already having their non-academic option lined up.  I find that, in a very large proportion of cases, the reason for quitting is the same: there is a difference between being a good student of a discipline and being a good scholar of that discipline, and doctoral programs is where that rubber meets the road. In fact, often people who were not the best students at all can be the best people as creative and motivated scholars.  Being a student is about getting the answers that someone already knows and can mark as correct, and being able to accomplish smaller tasks for a professor or other supervisor.   On the other hand, being a scholar is about answering the questions for which there are still no answers and, at a higher level, asking entirely different questions to begin with.  Suddenly, all the skills that might have propelled a student into that grad program in the first place (getting good grades, good test-taking skills, not riling the professors) are not so useful to him or her, and can even be a hinderance.

The reason I think the quitters might not be able to see the root cause of the problem is because what makes them really want to quit are the symptoms of that problem. For instance, when the students start to have these difficulties, a lot of them become depressed or lose motivation.  Some may feel just burned out or some may feel like it is kicking up some real mental health problems.  Also, when students are frustrated this way their relationships can suffer, they may feel that social problems are propelling them to reconsider their path.  Other students just start feeling academia is not a good ""fit"" for them, and the rat-race that it is certainly becomes more apparent. As a result, when you ask someone why they are quitting they say ""I'm burned out"" ""it's not for me"" ""I need a life"" or ""I was really battling depression.""

On a side note, I just want to say that I don't think this student vs. scholar problem is an inherent flaw in the grad student. If anything, it's a problem with an undergraduate/early graduate school system that encourages and rewards less creative work, and an issue all along with way with mentoring.

I agree with /u/CerebralBypass that this appears to go beyond general malaise. Although you turned down an offer, you feel unmotivated, unable to make a decision, unsure whether your decisions are meaningful, uncertain of what alternative paths to pursue, and uninterested in pursuing said paths.

I'd also note that by turning down a tenure-track appointment, you've already begun closing the door on academia. Word will absolutely get around that you turned down the job (but not for another offer). It's not (generally) because people want to be mean. It's because departments want to protect themselves from people who demonstrate, for lack of a better word, flaky or puzzling behavior.

You wasted a lot of people's time and energy by applying for a job you refused. These hires take a tremendous amount of committee work. I'm ***not*** saying declining was the wrong choice. I ***am*** saying there are professional consequences. The chances of garnering a TT position in almost every discipline is close to zero, regardless of pedigree. (I'll note there are a few exceptions, such as nursing.) It's not impossible, but it's unlikely you'll get more offers, especially with the unforeseen impact of COVID. But this is ok.

There are many, *many* good reasons to leave academia (and truthfully, most people either get squeezed out or left on the margins as horrifically exploited adjuncts). So, ***the issue isn't really about how or why or when to leave academia. The issue is that you feel extremely apathetic and directionless.*** You also feel ashamed enough that you lied to your advisor. So, you lied about something that they will likely learn the truth about later. I really encourage you to try therapy. It will also help you to move past concerns about disappointing others.

We ***severely overestimate*** how much people care about our decisions. Your advisors, like you, are primarily concerned with themselves (and perhaps their spouses and children). They rarely think about you when you're not physically present. Good advisors have good boundaries. We respect the decisions our students make. We respect these decisions not just because we are able to individuate, but also ***because your choices have zero impact on my life.*** (The only exception is if all of my students fail out of the program. If none of them gets a job, that's explained by the terrible job market.)

You might have to meet with one or more therapists before you ""click"" with someone, but be aware that in your present state, you may not *feel* like you click with anyone. In that case, just stick with one person for multiple sessions to give yourself a chance to make progress.

1. My field in the USA would qualify under social sciences, however I am in a STEM department. There is a lot of EU funding and if not EU, local governments do invest in a lot of research projects. My project for example is partially funded by a local government body looking to invest in local biodiversity and climate science.
2. I have an unbelievable amount of opportunity here compared to America. I went back briefly after my first stint here and it was not good for my health or well being because my basic needs weren't being met and I was overworked. I could not find work anywhere in my field because they did not fund basic things. I worked for the Parks Service on a major, major US history site and we had our budgets cut when the new admin came in.
3. Speaking of which, there is the stability of that funding is a lot more consistent here from personal experience. 
4. Better data accessibility within my own field.
5. People here don't generally fight me that climate change is a thing, thus making it easier to teach and a relief on my own mental health.
6. I can afford to treat my mental health and physical health before things become a problem.

dhbmoku,nuclearslurpee,t2_11caye,"Frankly, I'd be shocked if the vast majority of people in academia *aren't* mentally ill or unstable in some fashion. Academia already tends to attract the weirder subsets of society, i.e. nerds, and the stress plus long hours certainly don't do anyone any favors. There's a reason most proposals are co-written over beers, canonically.

This being said, a couple of things to consider:

&gt;I'm in a great program and my career is on track, but I still feel like I'm treading water every day, barely able to stay afloat, and worried that it will inevitably become impossible.

Try to divorce from how you feel and make a realistic assessment of where you're at. There's some psychological phenomena with a name I don't remember which boils down to when we look at other people we only see how successful they are, and when we look at ourselves we only see how much we've struggled to make it this far. It might feel like you're struggling just to break even and everyone else is succeeding effortlessly, but trust me - everyone else is struggling, working hard, and failing their asses off too.

&gt;My program and my research bring me some joy in addition to the stress, and I can't see myself doing anything else.

Sounds like you're where you're supposed to be, then. No matter where you go, if you have depression you're going to be depressed regardless. You may as well at least live your depressed life in a way that brings you whatever joy you can get out of it, right?

&gt;Is there anyone out there who's made it in academia who struggles with mental health issues on a daily basis and always has? Or do people like me eventually inevitably burn out and/or not make it?

e6ug638,CytotoxicCD8,t2_16oifq,"This may be true for the American system but definitely not the case for the Australian system. 

In some aspects PhD is the easiest part of your career. The degree is only 3 years with a max of 4 years. Most people finish between 3.5-4 years. 

You are guaranteed pay for 3.5 years (4 years as a citizen/perm resident). So you are not part of the grant application game. Not expected to apply for funding. Poor labs may ask you to but this would mean you are in a very poor lab and i would argue you should leave. 

It is hard work but it’s not impossible. You can easily get by doing 9-5 solid work a day. Most likely will be working quite a few weekends. But it is very flexible and I haven’t felt that my social life or mental health has suffered. It is stressful though. It does become your life. It’s full time. So when not actively working you are thinking about work and guilty for not working. The typical description is that a PhD is a marathon not a sprint. It’s long and arduous but not impossible. I’d honestly do another one if it wasn’t for the low pay. 

In Australia you get approx $25,000 a year, tax free. Iv had no problems and live quite comfortably but I have no dependants and live with a partner doing her PhD. We live in one of the cheaper Australian cities. 

I would agree that your supervisor is very important and have heard a couple of horror stories. These are rare. I only know of one person who had to swap PhD labs half way through. But they are not likely to have to restart and will probably just continue in a new lab on a new project. Most people who have supervisor troubles will swap labs early on. Otherwise just tough it out and get it done. My supervisors mentality is “it’s just a PhD, just submit so you can get on with real work”.  In Australia, people don’t fail they either drop out or the take a bit longer than ideal. Assuming your supervisor isn’t a terrible person then you will submit a viable thesis and graduate. It’s also quite uncommon to be juggling multiple projects. Most people will have their main project and may have a second and collaborate with others (doing small experiments or analysis) but majority of work is on a single project. 

Science is hyper competitive but largely this is post PhD where you are fighting for grants and jobs. Sure it helps to have many papers in your PhD but this is largely lab based. I haven’t published but am not concerned about postdoc jobs because iv learnt many skills. My partner on the other hand comes from a lab where they publish requested and everyone works together. She has &gt;8 papers to her name. She’s more likely to get grants as an early career. But then it all comes down to what you plan after PhD. Just pick a lab accordingly.

gcfymvf,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"First of all, I want to acknowledge that what you're describing sounds quite distressing. I can see that feeling this infatuation without having an outlet to talk about it is weighing on you, which makes sense given how deep your feeling is.

My advice to you is to:

1. Seek out counseling. It is a safe place to talk about your infatuation, develop skills for managing your feelings here, and ideally work to develop skills for healthier relationships. You describe feelings of extreme distress (crying for hours, mania) and it would be beneficial to have professional support with these feelings, too. Your college should have a student counseling center that you can turn to.

2. I would recommend avoiding this professor to the fullest extent possible. Given where you are at right now, having a clear and unambiguous boundary would likely be helpful. Don't take anymore classes with him. Don't find some reason to go to him for office hours. Etc. I imagine that having a clear line will help you to do what is best for your own well-being, and will help you to avoid false hope into some sort of relationship that will never be.

3. Despite all of the firm words here, I do hope that you can be kind to yourself. We don't choose who we feel attracted to, and the fact that you feel attracted to this professor is not your fault nor something inherently bad. We choose our behaviors, and unless I've missed something, you have not acted inappropriately. Of course, the behavior that you fantasize about is one that would not be appropriate to pursue, and you're spending a lot of time and mental energy thinking about it. It makes sense to work hard, ideally with a mental health professional, to change the way you interact with this attraction: to find ways to manage what sound like intrusive and repetitive thoughts and a high degree of distress that relate to this attraction. But again, I hope that you can be kind to yourself. I hope, for your sake, that you can move forward and find opportunities to develop attractions to people closer in age and similar in power to yourself, both to have hope at a relationship that has a realistic chance of happening, and ideally, to experience the joys that can come with that.",15,2020-11-16 00:18:39,AskAcademia

What is the nature of the scholarship? On what basis are they awarded? What are their criteria?

I do, unfortunately, think that the biggest risk you'd take is related to the stigma, which sucks, and which is also the reality we're working with. I also think this could work against you in two ways--first off, if there is even a HINT of irregularity in your academic history, I could see your disclosure encouraging some people to look at that more closely as evidence that your schizophrenia makes you an academic risk. Secondly, to SOME readers, this might sound like over-pandering or an appeal to their sense of pity--as in, you should win because you've had things much tougher than others. Is this a common theme for applications? You bet. Might this be differently (and even unfairly) interpreted when in the context of a mental health issue? I'm afraid it might be. 

I've found that many people in academia are not, in fact, as open minded and forward thinking as they'd like think they are when it comes to mental health.

Aft I drafted an outline for the main points I wanted to cover, then created slides for what I wanted to visualize. 

The actual defense was not at all as daunting as I imagined it though. The preperation is mostly for the introduction section of the defense/presentation.

fr2xx9y,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"I want to give you a (virtual) hug. It's clear that you are really struggling right now. A Ph.D. is difficult under any circumstances, and it is especially difficult in the middle of a fucking pandemic.

Some suggestions:

1. Seek out counseling, if you have not already done so. Most universities have transferred their counseling to teletherapy, so you can still get support. You're aware of your mental health struggles, which is great. There are steps you can take with the help of a professional to manage your anxiety.

2. I encourage you to have an honest conversation with your PI. You don't need to share the full extent of your mental health struggles, but I do think it is worth sharing that you've found it nearly impossible to get work done during the pandemic. I think your PI will appreciate an update on your deadline, and I imagine that you're fearing this communication with them. It may be like ripping off a band-aid, but I think you'll be in better shape having shared your struggle with your PI so that they have an idea of where you're at and, ideally, can support you academically. Perhaps the two of you can work on a revised timeline that feels genuinely realistic for you. Perhaps your PI has suggestions for navigating things. Perhaps your PI is struggling, too, and you will feel less alone. Perhaps your PI would even fully support you taking some time off. I encourage you to have this conversation in real time, if at all possible (i.e., via Zoom or phone).

3. Based on what the degree of anxiety you're describing and your stated desire to go home with family, I think taking a leave of absence is an option worth seriously considering. It would be good to relieve some of the pressure and have the support of family. To be frank, if your anxiety is debilitating enough that you will get very little done, then you might as well get very little done without the daily pressure and feeling of failure from not getting things done, as well as with the in-person support of loved ones. You can always resume your Ph.D. after you've had some time to attend to your mental health and when the pandemic has been more thoroughly addressed.

4. On that note, I encourage you to seek out social support. Talk with friends in your program. Talk with friends and family members in general. One of the challenges of the pandemic has been losing out on the kinds of day to day interactions we count on for support--catching up with a friend, or running into someone in the hallway and telling them about your day. If there are mentors you feel that you can turn to, I encourage you to talk with them, as well. You do not need to go through this alone.

5. I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself. We are in the middle of a global emergency. It makes sense that you feel anxious. It makes sense that you are having trouble concentrating. And although your level of anxiety is higher than the average person's, the kinds of symptoms you're describing (frequent panic attacks, crying spells, difficulty sleeping) are not things you chose. To be sure, there are steps you can take to address these aspects of your mental well-being, but none of this is your fault. We are all struggling in different ways right now, and it's OK that you're anxious and OK that you're struggling. It doesn't make you any less worthy as a person or any less of a good Ph.D. student.

I hope that you can get the support you need, and I wish you all of the best.",13,2020-05-18 23:53:57,AskAcademia

Their job is to provide immediate support and refer you to someone who can provide more long-term support. The university is a university, not a university/mental and behavioral health clinic. They don't have the funding, time, or manpower to support every student's every need. That's why they try to match students up with local counselors, therapists, and psychiatrists. Please understand that they are trying to help you as best as they can, but this may not have been communicated properly. It's also possible that you have seen a truly bad counselor, but that doesn't mean that every counselor is bad or that you're beyond help. It just means that they weren't a good fit. 

I highly recommend that you get in contact with your school's mental health services office, and see if they can help you find a counselor you feel comfortable with. If you're on your parents' medical insurance or are near your primary care provider, you might see if there are other offices within your network that are nearby and have openings. You don't necessarily have to tell your parents or doctor anything, and you could even frame it as you trying to be more responsible with your health by trying to take care of these things on your own.

dfk47iu,the_Stick,t2_lwcwk,"I am going to answer honestly.  I would want to know *everything* about your mental health.  I would want to ensure that you were receiving sufficient care and therapy and were sufficiently self-aware to manage your health and your interaction with others.

Part of the reason I would want to know is so that I could be supportive and maybe tailor assignments and deadlines more appropriately.  I would want to help and advise, though I couldn't (and wouldn't) take the place of your health care providers.

Why would I want to know so much?  Let me tell you about my Ph.D. lab; I was somehow known as the *normal* one which is pretty much the only time that adjective has been applied to me.  We had one graduate student who threatened to get a knife and stab an employee; fortunately, her issues were well-known to most (though not that employee) and given the right environment and support, she was a very solid scientist.  That was an extreme example that had some serious consequences and ultimately helped her (and her community) allow her to become successful.  Though I have lost track of her now, for at least a decade after that she only had less severe outbursts, finished her degree, got an industry job and accolades and raises.

Contrast that with a post-doc who snapped and threatened to get a gun and come in and shoot everybody.  That was the only time I ever saw my advisor rattled.  This guy had bounced between several labs but after this he was *gone,* and gone fast, including being deported.  As an advisor, I would want to know with certainty that the stresses you would face would not drive you to violence.

Now that latter example is extreme and from your questions it seems very unlikely that your mental health would lead to outwardly-directed violence.  It also seems that you are aware of your own health and care.    I would still want to know.

I don't mean to act like I know your background or what kind of mental illness you have, but in your other post I saw you mentioned anxiety disorder. Avoidance and distancing oneself from other is one of the worst symptoms of anxiety, and isolation is one of the hardest parts. It can be a kind of self sabotage. It sounds like you have great relationships with your profs, and if they've asked questions about your health they definitely will not think you are manipulative or a cry baby. A counsellor or therapist might be able to help you navigate how to handle this (your school probably offers this service free of charge and fully confidential).

As someone with an anxiety disorder, one of my best relationships with a prof came about because he was supportive of my anxiety, but also respectful of my abilities. He knew when to push me and challenge me, and knew when to give me space (if anything, he pushed me harder than other students because he knew I could do it). In my experience, profs don't want you to avoid special accommodations when you need them, they want you to communicate about them in advance. That doesn't necessarily mean telling them the details or the diagnosis, but telling them what they can do to help. They want to help you, want to see you do well, and want you to succeed.

Most professors are academics who will give you solid career advice on being an academic, but know very little about industry (because that is not the life path they went down).  Working with a former industry big-wig could have its own benefits. 

Granted, I know nothing about solar research, but something that stuck out to me was your comments about the relative size of the programs which you said ASU has a big program and Berkeley not so much.

It is probable that none of your classes will transfer and you will be set back a significant amount of time.  Plus, you have to think if the prof at Berkeley will even take you back after turning him down (and if he does take you back, then you are either a truly awesome applicant [good for you] or he does not get many quality applicants [red flag]).  

If you really want to transition to another school, I would wait to do it at a break point, ie after completing your masters.  No one should ever question someone shifting after a masters when you got it at the same place you did your undergrad.  It will also give you enough time to see if ASU is a good fit for your career goals.  Also remember that there are post-docs.  If you don't feel that ASU is giving you enough splash on your CV, do a post-doc at Berkeley or MIT or something. ",13,2016-10-08 07:16:14,AskAcademia

eff2bcw,Alternative_Squirrel,t2_26lbrndy,"OP, I think it’s great that you’re passionate. That’s something you really need if you’re to be successful in academia.

I’m a bit concerned that there are so many people declining to write a letter for you. I think this could be the result of one of two things:

1. As one of the other posters mentioned, you may be asking the wrong people. When it comes to grad school applications, what matters isn’t necessarily how “famous” your letter writers are - it’s how well they know you and your work. 

Obviously, they should be TT faculty, but they don’t need to be Harold Bloom. A glowing letter from an assistant prof will work better than a lukewarm letter from a Famous faculty member.

2. You may not be presenting yourself in the best light. I would also caution you against assuming that everyone else “has it easy”. I spent undergrad dealing with an extremely difficult family situation, and many of your peers aren’t “coasting” the way you think they are.

If possible, could you take a leave of absence for a semester or year to get your house in order? It wouldn’t reduce the financial strain, but it would hopefully give you some time to deal with the family situation and your mental health.

In the end, passion is necessary, but it isn’t enough. It’s not enough to just believe that you’ll create great work if only you could get into a PhD program - you have to show your profs that you have that potential right now.

I had a 3.3 GPA in undergrad. I also got into virtually every grad school I applied to, largely on the strength of my letters and my writing sample (social science, not humanities).

d8hdhj6,cletus-cubed,t2_4rmkr,"You have to keep in mind that students are as prone to mental health issues as everyone else, including personality disorders that can be very difficult to deal with. Many don't realize how common these disorders are in the population. For example, 1.2% of people in the US have schizophrenia. That's more than 1 in 100. Most of these people have their first psychotic break in their late teens-early 20s, basically college age. So if you teach a class with 100+ students every semester, eventually you will have a student who is in the midst of a psychotic break. 

Our population is increasingly medicated, and this is especially prominent in college students. Many have been on ADD medications for many years, then they move out of town, away from family and friends, to a drinking rich environment. They are vulnerable, and often can't get a psychiatrist in town very easily. They often go off their meds, either because they can't get in to see a psychiatrist, or because they want to try a different approach (i.e. mom and dad aren't demanding it). This can throw them into a very bad state.

My point is, that while some students just don't won't like you, there's a good chance they don't like anyone at this point, or you're just one of many things that they are focusing on as everything falls apart.",12,2016-10-07 02:33:27,AskAcademia

I think it's ridiculous that many academics brag about how much they work, and I find that it spreads a very unhealthy mentality that young students try to emulate. Yes, we tend to work more than peers in industry, but it would be insane to dedicate every non-sleeping hour of the day your research.

I found that in the first year of my PhD (physical sciences) I worked ~60 hour weeks most weeks and that decreased over time. Now in my final year I'm working between 40 and 50 hour weeks. Some people can push 60 hour weeks every week, but I think that sounds like a horrible lifestyle, and it's just not necessary. You'll learn to work smarter so that you can accomplish more in a shorter time frame.

When you apply to schools, ask your advisor what their weekly workload is like to give you a sense of what they will expect. I'm lucky in that my advisor encourages taking nights and weekends off, however other professors in my department push their students 7 days a week.

g1wiy6v,synthesis-synthesis,t2_3ev125pt,"I'm sorry you're having a difficult time. You're experiencing ***a lot*** of anxiety, and it isn't in proportion to the misstep you've made. Editors aren't in the business of embarrassing themselves and ruining their journals' reputations by publishing trash, so if the journal is reputable, then your article is being published because it's publishable.

Two specific issues I see here: 

**1) You're overestimating how closely most academics will read your work.** We have so much to do and so little time. Yes, there may be a handful of people who end up reading your article closely because it ties directly into something they're working on. But they're reading it *for what they can get from it and use in their own work.* They're not interested in meditating deeply on its flaws unless you've said something egregious.

**2)** **You have an unsubstantiated sense of panic about how they'll interpret or react to an inconsistent sentence/paragraph/section.** To be frank: no one is as preoccupied about this article as you. Most scholars are generous readers who will see that you tried, but stumbled or failed to pull something off in a particular section. Other scholars won't notice, because what you perceive as a flaw doesn't relate to the elements they're interested in. Anyone who notices and *does* take issue with your inconsistent treatment of XYZ will forget about it pretty much as soon as they put your article away. People have many demands on their time, and your piece is just one of many that they'll read in a given day or week.

Even when we read things closely and form nuanced opinions about them, we don't spend our free time imagining how incompetent the author must be ***if they haven't actually demonstrated true incompetence.*** What you're describing is just your own sense (not verified by anyone else) that you didn't explain a distinction well enough. 

**I have a strong suspicion that no matter how this essay turned out, your brain would have chosen** ***something*** **to cling to as evidence of your failure.**

So, I say this kindly and without judgment: **consider therapy.** A competent and compassionate mental health professional can help you navigate the distorted cognitive and behavioral patterns you feel stuck in. To be clear--I'm *NOT* trying to armchair diagnose you, and we **ALL** experience distorted thinking. Common examples include catastrophizing, black and white thinking, mind reading, etc.

The vast majority of academics--whether graduate students or faculty--would benefit from therapy, even in the short term. There are many false narratives that romanticize and idealize what it means to be an academic. One common element is that **they mistakenly tie one's self-worth to one's research/teaching in a way that diminishes and demoralizes people.** Institutions need people to buy into these narratives, because they're what convince us to work as an adjunct teaching five classes at three different universities for $1500 a class without health benefits. I say this as someone lucky enough to be on the tenure track.

Others have mentioned something else important, which is that you've learned a valuable lesson about how ***your perfectionism actually becomes a form of self-sabotage.*** By continuously nitpicking at the article, you actually lowered its quality (at least in your estimation). This is, again, something a trained professional can help you overcome.

My perspective is informed by the fact that although I grew up very poor, I ultimately earned my doctorate from an Ivy, held a fellowship at another Ivy, and am now a young professor at a top public R1. Many of my friends from these institutions and others have been unable to get TT positions over the years, despite their accomplishments.

After all, the fact that you've made a commitment of 5-6 years to a specific program, field, and city is starting to feel real now. Certainly, doctoral programs all involve a level of stress, and it makes sense to feel concerned about that, too.

A few tips:

1. Your advisor wouldn't have selected you if you weren't qualified. And, at the same time, being qualified doesn't mean that you don't have a lot to learn. There will be things that feel challenging to learn and many stresses along the way, but none of that means that you aren't cut out for this. You'll learn and grow over the course of your program.

2. A doctoral program is a not-insignificant chunk of your life. It's still your life, so do your best to treat it that way. (I'll admit, I wish I would have listened to this advice more myself in grad school.) Take the time to explore your new city. Work to establish a new network of friends--even now when everything is virtual, and especially once it's safe to do in-person things again. (That can include your cohort of fellow grad students who will also be in a new city where they may not know anyone!) I encourage you to avoid resigning yourself to being lonely for the next several years. You can complete a Ph.D. program and also build strong relationships. But you may have to take extra efforts to make that a priority.

3. If you're worried about your mental health, be proactive now. Consider seeking out therapy in the university's counseling center or broader community, especially as you navigate this difficult transition. (Most universities will offer e-therapy due to COVID, if safety is a concern for you.) And concerns about mental health are all the more reason to prioritize establishing a good support network and taking care of yourself in other ways (e.g., getting exercise, getting ample sleep, eating well, etc.).

deenl0j,_whatevs_,t2_h9vom,"Here's some rationale, for the sake of context and perspective. 

This happens way more frequently than you may initially suspect, but it's usually kept under wraps. For several reasons: it makes the supervisors look incompetent, forces everyone go through a hellish amount of bureaucracy to explain exactly what happened to justify the funds already spend, and try to keep the ones that haven't, all the while trying to minimize the impact this will have on future funding request. Also, if you are the only student funded to do that work, chances are the whole project is dead, and the years that went into preparing it and getting funds for it are wasted. Which seriously sucks.

Then there's the student, who following the supervisors example, also tends to keep it quiet in fear of being judged, and with the power balance skewed against him/her, is also afraid of how this will look on the CV.

This is always a big mess, and a lose-lose situation in the short term. But the supervisors tend to insist because:

1. pdh student drama is very frequently a part of the phd process, and if all phd's were interrupted at the first sign of distress, you'd have an extremely high dropout rate (I'd guess at least 50%); 
2. the supervisors may have ulterior motives, but it's also their job to help and motivate students
3. they also have ulterior motives
4. they stand to lose less if they convince the student to continue, even if they do a lousy job. though one could argue that the same is true for the student, were it not for health/mental health reasons. 

The student is in the tough spot of having to decide if he/she is truly at the limit, and risks losing health-wise versus what he/she stands to gain professionally if he/she continues. Which is a heart-wrenching decision to make. But once it is decided, there's no looking back, and his/her best option is to quit as cleanly and quickly as possible. Emphasis on cleanly. 

Bottom line, this is tougher on you, but it's also tough on everyone else, so you should handle the process with the respect everyone deserves. Make your case clear to everyone involved, and I trust in the end, if they're not complete jerks, they will be understanding.

Is this because psychological disposition is strongly associated with research(er) quality, which is what we're trying to optimize for? Or because being calm and measured is valuable in itself? I'd only care about making people anxious insofar as it helps them improve (in the sense of eustress), and less as a hazing or weeding mechanism (because I don't think you're targeting the trait of interest -- people can be great scientists and do excellent work while still being susceptible to anxiety or other mental health disorders, and the trial-by-fire, dog-eat-dog sort of atmosphere doesn't seem conducive for maximizing quality research output. In any case, students have the entirety of grad school and beyond to grow tougher skin, and a more nurturing environment might help more here. Obviously not ""*too*"" nurturing, but you could just as well make it even more demanding by getting rid of PIs and program resources -- let the best fend for themselves and they'll sort themselves out! Who knows where the ideal balance lies).

Hmm, well in my case, I only started looking into and strongly considering grad schools around the time the apps were due, and was leaning towards industry or government work before then. Lots of students aren't thinking of grad school at all, then, though -- rather, they're entering the workforce (and deciding to go to grad school much later) or getting research positions (or going into Master's programs) to better feel out how well an academic-y lifestyle suits them (which is a very common piece of advice!).

&gt; The student who either gives enough of a shit to learn about it or goes to a school where they make it a priority for people to learn about it will ON AVERAGE be a better candidate than somebody who either didn't care to learn about it or went to the type of undergrad institution where they don't make that a priority.

I guess this depends on how widely available information on the GRFP is if you're not already aware of its existence from prior chance exposure. How often do people apply for and get the GRF (or the Hertz, or the NDSEG, or the FORD, or the SMART, or the DOE, or the NPSC, etc.) without first hearing of it from their PIs or mentors (or friends)? My impression is rarely.

And sure, I agree that people from better schools (/departments/programs) are probably on average better students in that they've already been selected by the previous round of filters. But even purely from a meritocratic standpoint (no egalitarianism whatsoever!), who cares?! We should be trying then to select the best overall from the total pool, and not sampling preferentially from previously designated bins if we don't have to.

&gt; I think the potential of top applicants will be obvious right away. For example, in sports, you don't hold secondary try-outs to find the best players; you have them to get the top of the next tier.

I don't know enough about sports to really comment, but athletes could just as well have a bad day on the field (or w/e), could they not? Having a second round of tryouts with feedback from the first could help them fix the easy fixes and let their ""true"" potential shine.

Anyway, this whole change was spurned by the NSF's desire to increase diversity, which I don't think it's effectively doing.",12,2016-03-09 22:19:12,AskAcademia

The fact that your university and your department is not supportive of you (giving you resources for counseling, helping you reduce your workload temporarily, facilitating conversations with professors, etc) indicates that it would probably be an unpleasant PhD.

But, like you, I had an offer to come here, to do a PhD at a good university, fully funded with interesting work. So I took it, and I regret it immensely. The work has gone largely fine, but the location and its effect on the rest of my life have slowly worn me down.

A PhD is gong to take many years of hard and stressful work, don't make things even more difficult on yourself by living somewhere you won't like. A PhD is also a huge investment of the prime years of your life and it’s important that your non-work environment is somewhere that you can live that life enjoyably.

dq4lj0d,physicsknight,,"Having something else in your life to relax and relieve stress with is really important. It might seem counter-intuitive to add *another* thing to everything you are trying to do, but I would suggest putting it in your schedule and commit to do it regularly. For me exercising and playing guitar both really help me clear my head and relax. It will make going back to work and being efficient so much easier.

Clearing your head when doing those things is most important, I find. Completely separating yourself from your work. For me, physically separating myself can make that mental separation easier too. For example, in my apartment I try to work at my desk, but I eat/watch a show/other entertainment somewhere else. That way, when I want to relax I can go somewhere where I don't feel like I am supposed to work and thus I don't feel guilty about not working. That tends to help me better enjoy that time. If you spend your free time thinking and worrying about work, that time will have been wasted on not relaxing.

Lastly, if things really are overwhelming, see if you can do something about the work load. It's not uncommon for those near the end of their PhD to focus on getting their dissertation done and stepping back from some other responsibilities.

I just defended and am starting a job in industry in a couple of weeks. I won't lie, I had an awful time in grad school, but even if I hadn't and loved it I think the pay issue alone would scare me away from academia regardless. I've spent more than half a decade out of undergrad earning about half the amount of money my peers who didn't go into grad school do. Now I'm going into a position where my income will triple, I will get a generous annual bonus, a very generous 401k package, excellent health benefits for myself and my significant other, as well as a bunch of other perks. I look forward to only working 50 hours a week (omg weekends, what are those?) now. I suppose it is also worth mentioning I'm a woman of childbearing age who is itching to start a family. I know you are saying to yourself, ""Triple income? Well, the PhD is worth it, then."" I would say...if I had the choice to do it all over again, I wouldn't. This PhD cost me far too much of my own sense of well-being and mental health. Academia, in my opinion, is a very toxic environment for some kinds of people. I'm one of them.

Personally I think my friends in grad school who want to continue into academia (which, granted, are a minority of the people I know) are bananas. I think you'd have to be nuts to want to commit to lower pay, worse hours, competitive funding (even worse than 5 years ago with the public funding situation as it is), and go through the tenure process after having gone through the PhD process (and for myself, to go through that while I'm starting a family? No fucking way). Not to mention the postdoctoral treadmill issue, which goes right back to the ""terrible pay, terrible hours"" problem of grad school.

You're not the only one concerned about it, but you're right there's not much discussion on the subject as it pertains to academia specifically.

However, there has been a lot of discussion around student mental health in general which has led to universities getting more serious about offering mental health services to students.  It's still not great (at my school you have to wait months for an appointment unless you walk into the dean's office and tell him you're going to kill yourself, true story) but it is improving.  I don't know if there are similar services offered through health insurance for professors, but I hope so.  That's not something I ever see talked about to be honest.

In my experience mental health problems are rampant throughout academia, and it's only sometimes okay for people to talk about it.  Some professors are very open and supportive while others still see it as a sign of weakness.  It's a really stressful environment and you see the same types of problems in other similarly stressful fields (finance, for example).

From an individual's perspective, until it's widely accepted to talk about these issues out in the open I think it's really important to find a core set of friends who you can talk to and be extremely open about this sort of stuff.

Don’t get too hung up on the piece of paper (the degree). That said, do get an education—even if it’s work experience that leads you in a direction you want to go. Lots of times, a certification or license makes more difference than a degree.

And, not at all making light of your suffering, but sometimes people are depressed because their life just sucks. Look at what you can change. A slightly nicer living arrangement or location. Slightly more regular sleep/wake times. Slightly less alcohol/drugs. So on.  Some people claim CrossFit changed their lives, and for all I know, it might be true.

There are academic programs that really are all about gay and minority issues. If this dominates your life, then see if there are scholarships. You never know. They might really be looking for exactly what you offer.

On the other hand, there is another approach to life where you completely separate the money making part of your life from the soul-fulfilling part. The movie version of this is the corporate lawyer who spends his nights as a drag queen belting out torch songs. This is actually how MANY people survive.

e84rqsz,Weaselpanties,t2_5w94f,"Hello future academic! 

I started college late in life as a broke, undereducated mixed-race single mom, so I am really feeling your predicament. I was pretty highly literate because both my parents have good educations, but my mom has serious mental health and substance abuse issues, which resulted in her withholding an education from me. Dad was out of the picture for most of my childhood, because Mom fled the state with me. So, while the story is a little more complex than this, basically I was an adult 3rd-grade dropout when I entered community college in 2012. I have learned A LOT about scholarships and financial aid since then and I am hoping some of what I learned will be helpful for you. 

First of all, yes, I do absolutely recommend applying to community college, if the one in your area has a good reputation. They vary widely. You have a great story and you're a strong writer, and my advice is; milk that. 

You'll want to start by filling out your FAFSA online so that you qualify for Federal financial aid. Make sure you check ""yes"" for work-study; it doesn't mean you'll get it but it won't hurt to apply. Depending on your state, this may include grants that will cover the majority (or all) of your community college tuition. You may also need to take out subsidized loans for the first couple of terms, but the next steps should help you minimize the amount of debt you graduate with, if any.

Next, apply to your community college. As soon as you're admitted, look for information on applying for scholarships through their website. Talk to advising if you don't see a link; most CCs have an application portal. Also look and ask around about a state-specific scholarship website; I don't know if all states have them but mine (Oregon) does, https://app.oregonstudentaid.gov/. Hopefully your state has something similar.

Apply for ALL scholarships you qualify for. When you do this, write your application essays in Word and save them in a folder so that you have a pool of pre-written essays that you can revise and build on for future applications. Keep an eye out for new scholarships becoming available, as the application windows are not all the same. You will probably win a small scholarship or two in the beginning; this is great, because when recipients of small scholarships do well, they become more likely to be awarded larger ones; you will note all of your scholarship awards on your CV. 

Next, look for internship programs for disadvantaged students. Many of these are for STEM, but not all. These are programs that hook up students who normally could not afford to gain experience in their field through unpaid volunteering with paid positions, often during the summer. Internship and volunteer experience is so important that even if you can't get a paid position, I highly recommend trying to fit in 10 hours a week of volunteer work in your field, if only during summers. Teaching music or acting to kids, whatever you can get involved in. 

Getting to know your professors by going to their office hours a couple of times a term will help them write you good letters of recommendation. 

Study groups are excellent for improving your grades, and also for making connections with people who you will likely keep running into throughout your career. Cultivate these contacts.

Like I said, 7 years ago I was a broke single mom. I'm not rolling in dough, but I just started my 2nd Masters program and am an adjunct professor at the community college where I started. It's humble, but it's a far cry away from the lifetime of retail work I was looking at a few years ago. 

Good luck, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions!

Not American, but from what I've read, the systems at Cambridge are actually better than the ones I'm used to. But my supervisor is from the US and is very open about supporting students like myself, so I'm not too concerned that they'd react awfully. I definitely won't be leading any conversations with the schizo bombshell, though. I know to let people form their opinion of me first and *then* disclose the condition, and I waited 3 years to tell my undergrad supervisor. But I'm worried that there's no good guidance on how to disclose stuff beyond the ADHD/depression level, even from disability services or my mental health team. I'm just trying to figure it out for myself and hope I don't make a massive blunder along the way. 

&gt;I would consult with your medical team again.

I have asked them repeatedly, but it eventually got to the stage where they said that they had no idea how to manage it, and that they thought I should drop out and move into a group home. The stigma is exceptional for schizophrenia, and for some good reasons. They've never had a patient who's lived wholly independently. And I had to do quite a lot of shopping around before I settled on the team I have.

&gt;And reach out to the disabilities office and ask them what specifically they will be able to offer you insofar as remedial assistance.

I'm not really sure how to go about this one, if you don't mind. I already contacted them and they already provided me with the list of possible accommodations, but none are appropriate. Basically, I just need the space to decompress and be alone for a few hours a day, but I'm not sure how that could be worded into a concrete accommodation. 

&gt;The concept of self-study sort of permeates everything: you're smart enough to get in, and they expect you to be smart enough to solve most your problems yourself

Oh, I'm fine for the learning aspect of things. I completed my degree in the normal timeframe and handed every assignment in on-time. I don't ""lead"" with my condition because I've honestly never needed to explain away any gaps or poor performances, and aside from the disclosure, I don't mention any kind of disability in any applications for anything. I figure things out for myself mostly, but I doubt I've ever met another person in my situation. There's loads of resources on how to manage depression and higher education, but really nothing for schizophrenia, and disability support workers will suggest things to people with depression, but they generally have no idea what to do for me.

If you are not absolutely burning with passion for the subject I seriously urge you to reconsider. Just because a position is presenting itself to you does not mean it is the right thing for you. If it’s just burnout, and you are still passionate, take a gap year. If the position is a good fit for you, it will still exist in the future, and if it doesn’t, you will find another opportunity.

You're an Australian PhD student, which means you presumably get 4 weeks of paid holiday time a year (depending on your scholarship/funding). Have you taken them? Take them.

Do a tour and meet new people or just backpack around for a while, but get your mind off of what you're doing. Hell even if you just take a road trip down to Melbourne or something it's at least doing something different.

My supervisors and committee are very adamant about me taking all of my time off (hell they've even told me I can take more, as long as my work gets done). It's important to your mental health to take a break for a while or the work will consume you.

d8j0plj,manova,t2_35w8d,"First, you have to assume you even get to work with the person.  I had a former student get into a PhD program working with a nobel prize winner.  She had no access to him.  She worked in a lab with 50+ other people and her mentor was a senior grad student.  It was all just so you could say you were in the lab.  She left for another lab within a year.

I had another former student go to a big deal's lab.  I warned her about the lab.  In 20 years, that prof had graduated one PhD student and there was currently a grad student in her 8th year in the lab.  My former student quit the program after a year because of the prof.

I had another former student go to a top named school, but got paired with a relatively new prof.  He would not let her leave the lab.  He would not let her attend classes and gave her a cot to sleep on in the lab.  Finally, after she almost flunked out at the end of her first year, she went to the Chair and things got fixed (she was moved and he was banned from having new grad students).

OP is talking about his mental health problems.  In my experience, students don't just drop that unless it is a real issue.  That is not something to take lightly in considering a PhD program and the potential of not finishing. 

It does you no good to work for a hard-ass if it means you will not graduate.

e1sib1c,revthwy,t2_c553dju,"Staff do a lot of important work at the university - no one is saying we should get rid of the janitors or the cafeteria workers or the bus drivers or the IT department or the admissions and financial aid officers. In fact, many of those folks on the bottom rung of providing services to the university deserve to get paid more. However, there are several big problems with the growth of administration. 

The first is that not all of these new jobs are actually useful to anyone else at the university - they just push paper around, creating more work for everyone just so they can look busy. Some even admit this. [The growth of mid-level management that does nothing but ""supervise"" people who don't need supervising, thus necessitating a team of useless admin assistants to these useless managers,](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Are-You-in-a-BS-Job-In/243318) is pretty absurd. According to the [New England Center for Investigative Reporting](https://www.necir.org/2014/02/06/new-analysis-shows-problematic-boom-in-higher-ed-administrators/), ""The number of non-academic administrative and professional employees at U.S. colleges and universities has more than doubled in the last 25 years, vastly outpacing the growth in the number of students or faculty."" Think about the amount of resources spent on ""strategic visioning"" or plans to reorganize the internal operations of the university even though things were working fine before or circular fundraising efforts that raise money to pay the salaries of the people who call up alumni to ask for money. I mean, how many useless committees have you been forced to sit on? Maybe at a small school like yours it isn't as much of an issue, but at big state schools there are endless vacuous committees that all the faculty members dred sitting on because they are pointless. Much of this could simply be cut, tomorrow, without anyone missing these positions.

The second problem is that the university is currently expected to take on the responsibilities of the government and fill the gaps in a thinning social fabric writ large. How many resources are expended to provide students with basic healthcare, [counseling](https://www.agb.org/trusteeship/2017/mayjune/under-pressure-the-growing-demand-for-student-mental-health-services), nutrition and fitness? How many resources are spent ensuring that students have opportunities to socialize and connect with one another? How many resources are spent providing help to students facing interpersonal conflicts, difficulty with adult responsibilities, legal problems, social isolation, stress, health problems, discrimination, or violence? This is a complex problem; the university can't cut most of this, or the students will suffer, but it isn't fair that we are being expected to finance basic resources that government or society should be providing, but isn't. And at the same time, state funding is being cut!

Finally, [many of the jobs now being handled by administrators used to be handled by faculty](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-fall-of-the-faculty-9780199782444?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;), but because of increasing pressures to publish publish publish almost exclusively, professors don't have nearly as much time to do things like sit in on their advisee's courses and provide feedback on teaching. Hence, we need a Teaching &amp; Learning Center! Likewise, faculty are too busy to keep track of graduate students' progress or university-wide deadlines, so now we need extra staff at the graduate school and the enrollment office and the dean's office and each department - at least some of which is devoted to pushing students out as quickly as possible with no regard for the pace that is appropriate for the particular kind of research. Many of these rules are new inventions in the last 20 years, and they change constantly. What if we went back to a model where your committee (and to some extent, the department) had the latitude to give you strict deadlines and requirements or allow flexibility, as appropriate for a given situation? Do we need all these people supervising whether some PhD student must go up for exams right now, or must take this course, or whatever?

Sadly publishing in bogus journals appears to be the norm here in China as the journal is actually recommended by my supervisor (he himself has published in it as well) as the whole publish or perish thing is even worse here, with master students required to publish at least one paper in journals just to graduate. I do believe my supervisor had good intentions though - my OCD (and the general anxiety that inevitably comes with it) is still here and only somewhat controlled with a huge dose of medications, and back then, before I submitted my paper for publication, the anxiety of being unable to graduate for not having a published paper had been tearing me apart; getting it published at least helped a little.

I understand that not turning in assignments doesn't mean you're lazy, but you should think long and hard over whether going to grad school is the best choice for you right now (whether or not the grad program lets you in). 

Before you go to grad school, you need to figure out how to get your mental health to a place that you can function effectively in courses. Its *much* better to take a few years off and come back when you think you have the skills and stability to be successful than to build up a record of failure -- remember, if you go to grad school, and struggle and don't finish, and decide later in life to reapply, you'll need to submit those transcripts to wherever you're reapplying. Mind you, this is also true if you take any job in your field. If you take a job and start struggling and missing deadlines, you'll gain a reputation. And frankly, in the professional sphere, nobody really cares about *why* you're not succeeding -- whether it is mental health struggles or not -- they just care that you're not an effective worker. 

You mention this distinction between academic and professional work in your original post, that you never miss professional deadlines, but I'd be very cautious about expecting that this will sustain itself once you leave undergrad. For now, you've been prioritizing professional over academic deadlines but soon enough all deadlines will be professional deadlines.

I'll also add that there is a large shift between the expectations of being an undergrad volunteering on a research project and being a Ph.D. student. On some level, there may be a need to directly clarify expectations.

I'm glad that you are planning to have a real-time conversation with her. Hear your student out: what challenges is she facing right now, are there expectations that she is unclear about, etc? To the extent that she is experiencing challenges (and no doubt, transitioning to a Ph.D. program in the middle of a pandemic, she is), show empathy. This is hard, no one predicted this a year ago, and it is important that you come from a place of support, not punitiveness.

There is also room for a conversation about the ways in which you would like to see growth. I would very much so frame this as you did in one place above: part of normal growing pains between undergrad and graduate research. Share your expectations with her and explore and discuss what feels realistic for her right now. What feels realistic from her right now may be more than she is doing now and perhaps it's less than what you might like under better circumstances. If everything is remote, know that so much of the socialization to a Ph.D. program happens from informal in-person experiences (e.g., conversations in the lab) that may not be happening right now.

Finally, there may things going on for your student that you are not aware of. These include: mental health concerns, struggling with isolation, fear that vulnerable family members will become ill during the pandemic (or grief and loss, if loved ones have died), or caretaking obligations (e.g., if she has children or elderly parents nearby). While you don't want to pry, per se, know that there may be more going on.

To sum it all up: listen. Come from a place of support--so clearly and explicitly supportive that, even though you may be clarifying your expectations and asking her to do more, she will feel supported. Affirm whatever she is doing well already, share that you see her potential, validate that this is an incredibly difficult time, and acknowledge that the transition from undergrad to Ph.D. student has a learning curve. Make sure it is clear that she is not ""in trouble,"" but that this is an opportunity early on to create a plan for success rather than let the status quo go on longer and create more significant problems. Use ""I"" statements and take great lengths to avoid accusations. Conversations like these are never easy, but how you navigate a conversation like this can make or break how the student feels in your lab and the program, so I encourage you to view this as an opportunity to both help your student get on a better track while also building your rapport with them so that they feel you are a person they can trust going forward.",10,2020-09-14 15:41:10,AskAcademia

It just may be less difficult to succeed with (some types of) poor mental health than it is in common alternative careers for many fields, so some people with mental health issues (or some types of physical health issues) try harder to stay in academia than people without them because they don't really have a viable alternative. And some fields and locations have a problem of abuse of PhD students, which can aggravate some types of mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety. 

One possible exception is that some individuals with some types of autism spectrum disorders (which are included in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, but it is questionable if they are actual mental illnesses or neurological disorders or just neurological differences) are at advantage for some types of research work, mainly due to ability/compulsion to hyperfocus on the area of interest for long times, non-verbal thinking and/or hyperacute senses (most commonly hearing and touch). Thus some such individuals in some circumstances do exceptionally well in PhD research (but they can also do exceptionally badly if forced to work in ways which don't work for them) and thus [have higher likelihood of becoming professors](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/is-your-college-professor-autistic/).

But even if this woman's unsubstantiated (and prejudiced, since it involves phrenology) claims made it past the editor's desk, reviewers would notice the gaps and inconsistencies. She may be ""famous,"" but peer review is double-blind for a reason. (Now, sometimes people can make reasonable guesses about who wrote/reviewed something, but that's less relevant here.)

ek3avdg,lumabugg,t2_hx5qq5k,"How much are you willing to reveal to your advisor? Honestly, it sounds like your disability accommodations are things that could fall well within needs for a variety of mental illnesses. Your need for a quiet office, meeting flexibility, and inability to go on a hike with 100 strangers could sound like accommodations for someone with anxiety/panic disorder to someone who doesn’t know your diagnosis, and, at least here in the US, anxiety is the most common mental health issue. Has your advisor spent any time in American academia recently? If so, there should be an awareness of accommodating students with mental illness as there has been a sharp increase in diagnosed college student mental illness in the US.

If you’re willing to at least tell your advisor you have “diagnosed mental health issues,” without giving your full diagnosis, you could then request something like, “Due to diagnosed mental health issues, I need a quiet place to work, experience an increased need for personal space, and may require flexibility in meeting times, with my preference being that most meetings are held in the afternoon, as this is when my health is at its best. I am also unable to attend the Gates hike, as four days of strenuous activity with strangers and no personal space will be very bad for my health.”

Or, better yet, get your doctor to write that out. It sounds to me like you know what you need, you’re just nervous about asserting yourself to ask for it because you can’t offer a full explanation for fear of how it will be perceived.

They are necessary, look at these times as an investment too, and don't feel guilty about it. Have a socisl life, have friends and loved ones you can spend time with. 

That said, balance in all things. Some people party too much and don't finish, others never take a break and work themselves into emotional/social problems (the latter is much more common). Find the balance that works for you. 

The other big one: be nice to people. There's a lot of assholes in grad school, don't be one of them. There's a good chance you will be interacting with these same people professionally for the rest of your career. Be nice, be somebody that others want to hang out with. Help people, have empathy, be generous, even when it feels others are not doing the same. 

It will always end up better for you this way (for example, I know people that have not gotten hired for jobs or gotten conference speaking invites or other opportunities because even though they are great scholars, they were assholes in grad school and now that rep hangs around their neck).

By ""policy""- I don't mean anything official, but that I have cultivated certain reactions that I have with students that protect them from my moments of cynicism. For example, when someone tells me they missed an exam because of a death in the family or some other hardships- I just believe them (or act as if I do, even if I am skeptical) When a student fails a class because they missed some easy assignments, skipped a ton of class or something like that- I assume they are going through something difficult in their life (not that they just don't care). The fact is- life is hard, especially when you are 18-23 years old. Often students are overwhelmed by the things happening in their own lives, dealing with depression or other mental health issues. Many are still learning basic life skills like time management, balancing their financial expenses, friendship and boyfriend/girlfriend dynamics. You can only do so much, and your students are where they are. 

If you have specific issues with written work students are doing- then change the nature of the assignment. Require additional drafts, or build writing into your class time or something like that. Of course they will do the bare minimum of what you require- because they are juggling a bunch of other things and making their own cost benefit analyses in terms of their time and energy.

em1fkzw,EssGee_AP,t2_1t3llkdk,"One major thing that has changed in my field is that instructors are encouraged to design classes to minimize potential mental health issues for the students. Often this has the effect of reducing the rigor of classes. This is due to 2 major reasons:

(1a) A student requesting an accommodation due to any mental health issue, be it depression or anxiety, etc., simply cannot be ignored or else the faculty member risks their career. This is OK, we all can agree that mental health is a serious issue.

(1b) To avoid these sorts of requests, I and others I have spoken to have essentially reduced the difficulty of classes. I used to have an exam and an essay that were due in the same week, along with a (small) progress report for the final project. Although having this much to do, and an entire semester to plan for it, replicates the real world work environment, I simply can't expect my students to be able to handle it anymore. The requests for extensions and/or other excuses pour in - I can't say no to many of these requests without a risk for complaints about lack of empathy for mental health issues, some-sort-of-bias, simply being mean, etc.

(2) A second reason is simply that the administration is advocating for reduced difficulty for the above reasons. So the pressure is coming from both below (students) and high (leadership).

Obviously I have mixed feelings about all this. I worked in the industry for 8 years before pursuing my PhD. I want my students to demonstrate that they can reach a level of planning and productivity that will allow them to succeed.

That said, there are at least two scenarios in which your intervention may be warranted.  First, if the student's mental health problems are clearly affecting their work, you likely need to step in and discuss the problem with the student.  In this case, it might be a good idea to let the chair of the department/director of training know that the issue exists, especially if the problem stands to affect the rest of the lab or the entire department, though ideally the student should contact that individual directly, given the very personal nature of the problem.  Intervention options in this case could include things like a reduced workload or even a leave of absence, with the support of the department.

The second scenario in which your intervention might be justified is when the student specifically asks for your help.  In that case, you'll have to use your own judgment to determine whether the student's requests can or should be accommodated or whether there is anything else you can do to help.  It's okay to empower your student to ask for what they need, and it's your job to determine if what they're asking for is something you can reasonably grant within your scope as an advisor.

There's no shame in discontinuing a PhD if you've found a new career path you're more passionate about that doesn't require the degree. 

But, a few things you wrote stand out to me - 

&gt;Lately, I’ve been trying to self-learn the fundamentals with the help of online-videos and some art textbooks.

&gt;I’m confident that I can train myself to competent levels in making concept-art and illustrations. However, I have very limited knowledge about the industry at large.

&gt;For the short-term, I think I’ll be able to find trainee positions, internships and contract work in art and design: however, I don’t know how things will hold up in the longer term.

I have a friend who is going to change careers in two years. In the meantime she's picked up a small side gig and she's developing skills, making connections, and building a photography portfolio so that when she finishes her current job she is well-equipped to launch a new phase of her life as a photographer. I have another friend who is a freelance graphic designer with 10+ years of experience, and he still has trouble landing clients and finding work, and has been unsuccessful in finding a longer term more permanent position. Now, I don't know your geographic location or financial situation, but if you have no experience in the field, no portfolio, no connections in the industry, you might find it very hard to launch into a trainee position or internship like you're thinking you can find right off the bat, just based on what my friends - one starting out, one more established - seem to be going through. But definitely give it some thought and look into it if you're thinking this is what you really want to do! If sticking with the PhD program is unbearable, I'd suggest finding some other type of dayjob while you work on developing your art skills and portfolio. Graduating with your degree could position you to also take on scientific and medical illustration jobs as well, with developing your portfolio, skills, and connections being a useful hobby to keep your morale up. 

&gt;I have a tendency to get stressed under pressure (e.g. when I’m nearing a deadline).

If you're taking contract work in art, this isn't going to go away.

While I say it's not OK, the logical action depends on levels and nuances and details - e.g., if you're being treated excellently \*otherwise\*, somehow, and that person is actually helping you, and the interaction could be ambiguous in some way... And I realize it's easy for someone not in your position to say, don't put up with it.

But if it's damaging your mental health, screw retaliations, not getting ground down comes first. You could set up a discussion with the PI or module coordinator-type person, without making a formal complaint yet, so you might control the narrative at least. But it's unfortunately always going to be risky (but not doing something could be too - if they might disadvantage you down the line, it might be better to have a paper trail of bullying allegations).

Depression and mental health issues are a serious occupational hazard: for example PhD students develop mental health issues at roughly double the rate of the general population. 

If you need representative numbers, then [this study from the UK](http://go.nature.com/roysoc)[PDF] could provide some insights: 0.45% of people who start a PhD will end up with a tenured position, across all fields. The numbers vary somewhat by country, but the trend is the same everywhere: it's a massive pyramid with very few people on top. ([Here](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf20301/report/postgraduation-trends#job-market) are comparable numbers for the US academic job market). I would assume that as with almost everything else, underrepresented minorities have it even tougher than usual. 

Competition breeds asshole behaviour unfortunately, and you have been at the receiving end of it. I'm sorry that this happens to you, and I'm sure that you are working as hard as you can and make the best out of a tricky situation. Just remember that your academic colleagues have no say about your self-worth - that is your own, and not determined by any marker of academic achievement (though surely it doesn't make getting a rejection letter any easier).",8,2020-09-13 20:41:13,AskAcademia

dog0k4s,Drbananabeak,,"OK first things first - if  a mediator went to your faculty to talk about this, they may have the feeling you do not wish to talk about it (or they may even have some guidelines on how to behave - which is probably not to bring it up unless you do). So they are most likely not indifferent.

Second, if there is something major that is preventing you from progressing as you (or they) wish, then you need to talk about it with them. Professors are also people - they have dealt with their own mental health throughout their uni years, they are not some aliens who won't understand. My advice (if you are happy to talk about it with them) would be to schedule a meeting, sit down and explain it to them. They will most likely be able to work with you and try to come up with a realistic time line.

In my eyes, it is more unprofessional to not say anything, than it is to come to them and try to find a solution together.

That said, since we're on the same page about not caring too much about what others are going through, I'll be blunt:

It's obnoxious that you're self-aware about the length (e.g., mentioning that tweet quote) yet you decide to post a song lyric anyway in your ""earnest"" call for help. Write to your audience, certainly that's something you learned with your humanities degrees.

Here's the rub: You've been unemployed for three years. Unless you're skimping on the details, that's a substantial time and employers aren't going to be sympathetic to whatever personal issues you've had or accept volunteer work as a substitute when you've failed to demonstrate the ability to hold down a job for any significant length.

If you go on to a PhD program, the very real endgame is that you'll be facing the same issues you are now, with an even greater disparity between your age/experience and those of the other job candidates. This would be mitigated by a fallback path that you developed before or since completing your MA, but it seems that hasn't been the case.

On that note, this is frustrating to read:

&gt; So, while I would very much like to pursue criticism via freelance writing, I know that's a risky gambit and I'm quite uncertain about the viability of such an occupation. Plus, there are a lot of related issues that trouble me (let's put it this way, I recently entered the following two words into Google: ""freelancing"" ""pension"").

Have you been doing any freelance writing during those three years or did your risk aversion prevent you from starting? Not only does it provide the opportunity to develop your writing and your portfolio, I don't see how freelancing pensions are relevant when it's being compared to unemployment.

Moreover, you've expressed interest in all these career paths related to film but have you networked with these professionals? It worries me that you write about resumes and film festivals not hiring you while not discussing ways to get your foot in the door. Just because film preservation is a more technical career doesn't make networking any less important.

In short, cast your net wider. It's not just retail, film festivals, or a PhD. I just grabbed an Uber ride in L.A. from a driver who's trying to make his way through Hollywood as an actor after switching careers from TV commercial production and casting.

cif9fo3,Brattipatti,t2_cvl4x,"It's hard! Rejection is part of the package- if you really feel you cannot handle it, perhaps consider another profession. Your mental health and happiness are not worth losing! 

If you are committed, here are some of my tips:

1. Asses your professional strengths and weaknesses. (and realize that everyone has them!)- maybe writing formal manuscripts isn't your strength. That's ok. Realize what you are good at.  Have you gotten amazing feedback on lecturing? Are you the social superstar at your department? Can you read 10 books at the same time? Whatever they are- know what you're good at, and know what you need help with. I HATE asking for help, but when I focus on all the things I can do well without asking for help- it makes it easier to accept the things I just can't excel in on my own. 

2. Recognize your accomplishments. In most fields, being a PhD students means that you have done a lot! take the time to remind yourself of those. Read your CV! It is not easy, but celebrate your accomplishments and focus on them. even small things like ""I completed 9 of my 10 goals this week, AWESOME!"" instead of ""I can never finish all my goals, I suck""... honestly, be aware of your perspective and try to focus on the positive. 

3. Try to consider other end goals in submitting to journals than just publishing. This sounds weird, but if you make it an exercise in something else, rather than getting your paper accepted- you'll be ok with any result. For example, you could submit to journals for the following reasons: getting feedback on a potential chapter; seeing if you can fewer negative comments than the previous time; challenging yourself to submit 3 articles over a year. See how none of those have to do with the outcome? I have found this helpful (especially with funding applications!). It's kinda like the ""you'll find love when you stop looking"" philosophy- but it does take the rejection sting off. If you are not doing it to get accepted, you won't care if you get rejected.

It will be helpful for you to find something you can do that signals to your brain that it is not work time. I personally cannot read fiction with any regularity now, ten years after starting my PhD.

Then another prof overheard me talking about leaving and stepped in. I started working for her and things improved a lot.

The other really rough period was while I was writing my dissertation. I was doing interviews that were reaaally emotionally taxing and transcribing them all myself, so I would pretty much wake up, sit down at my computer, put headphones on and transcribe details of homelessness, sexual abuse, domestic violence, etc for eight hours straight. I was also on the job market and not having much luck, which made me feel inadequate and that all my hard work was for nothing. My spouse was in exactly the same situation, so things were tense at home, AND I found out that my mother and sister would be moving overseas, which was devastating for me. This dark time cleared up as 1) winter passed, 2) the dissertation came together and turned out really well, and 3) we landed jobs together. I also saw a counselor at the campus clinic to help me through. She was wonderful.

I have just finished my first year on the job. In some ways it was really difficult, like the dissertation period, but I feel like I have more resources to cope. Not gonna lie, having more money helps! I started seeing a personal trainer 2x a week, which has been great for my physical and mental health. I've had some publishing success, and getting my research started in our new area has kept me busy and distracted. I started hiking and geocaching to get me outside in the sun and fresh air.

Sometimes I feel guilty that I spend time exercising and doing other recreational things instead of working more, but I realize that working all the time would NOT make me more productive, because I would be miserable and burned out. I am most productive when I make time in my day for exercising and relaxing - having that time off allows me to spend my work hours *working* instead of, uh, crying and hating life.",7,2015-07-17 21:01:33,AskAcademia

Another thing you said, OP, struck me... That at 1.5 years out you are about as healed as you will get.  Healing from sexual assault can take many years.  Sometimes you have a lot of progress with it, sometimes you may regress too.  But sometimes things plateau and stay the same for a while.  My assault was many, many years ago and I still occasionally have little epiphanies.  I bring this up for two reasons.  First, grad school can be one of those regression-casing things.  95% of grad school is all power plays and making other people feel small -- so how could it not be triggering?

dqi89o9,Pathological_RJ,,"Apologies for the incoming typos and horrible grammar as I’m on mobile

I would not stress about the 1.5 year gap, from the outside it does not look like as long as it does from your perspective. It seems like you have good undergrad grades, and if you prepare you should be able to do well on your GREs. The biggest gap you may have in your application seem to be the absence of recommendation letters and documented (published) research success.

I’ve seen other commenters recommend pursuing a M.S., which would be decent option if you can find a funded program. Another option is to work as a lab tech for 1-2 years, which would allow you to gain experience while also getting a salary and benefits. I did this for 3 years after undergrad and it was a great experience, I was able to get my name on two papers and take free PhD level classes while working. When I was interviewing for positions I made it clear that I wanted to work for 2-3 years with the goal of going for my PhD, and ended up choosing a lab that let me have independent projects and take classes. 

One major benefit was being able to pick the brains of both PIs and grad students, which helped me strengthen my applications. My PIs gave me great letters and let me do practice interviews, and also read over my application letters. 

One piece of advice that I would give anyone considering a PhD is to make sure and establish support networks, both in your program and outside of school. Research is difficult and can be extremely stressful and isolating. Set up study groups with your cohort, these will be the people that you spend the most time with in your first years in a program. You may end up at opposite ends of campus once you join labs, but it’s useful to have these connections down the road. Having people to vent to, bounce ideas off of, share protocols with can really help.

Even though the class work and research seem to require more hours than are in the day, make time to have a social life, both with your lab / cohort and also outside of the school. This is incredibly important for maintaining mental health and will make you more productive in the long term. 

Best of luck!

c5y9y72,malomonster,t2_65z4r,"Do you have a textbook from the class? I'd suggest looking at it and what it defines ""spiritual wellness.""

I'm not sure if your exact answers are being returned to the professor. If so, then that is an issue. That's no one's business. Don't complete the assignment and talk to your professor. However, I would think this is just a personal assessment, for you to see where you might fall in a world perspective. 

As far as ""Spiritual Health"" I think that's a bit of a misnomer. If the assignment said, ""Let's look at your mental wellness"" it would make you think you had some sort of psychological issue. Or people would assume they're getting a psychological evaluation. 

A quick search for ""health and wellness spiritual health"" shows a few classes which discuss the topic. Generally, what it means by that phrase is ""How are you feeling in life?"" Religion is a source for people to find hope and greater good in the world. If one believes in a deity or some higher power, then a person can fall back on those teachings for inspiration or guidance. For others, alone time to think about life and goals is good enough.

**TL;DR:** Talk to your professor if s/he will be seeing your exact responses. If it's not reported, this is just a personal assignment -- like taking the personality tests -- to see where you fall in a well-being continuum. 

**EDIT:** If you do talk to the professor, don't come out angry, and don't say you're offended. You're not offended. You're concerned about what will be done with the responses you gave.

I am an MD/PhD and I considered this hard while deciding to do a PhD as well as an MD, or just an MD. I wanted to do research as well as treat patients in an academic setting (no private practice for me). The PhD alone hasn't gotten me more grants otherwise, but it helped me become a better researcher and make connections that I needed later on. 

You should at least finish your BS. At least in the sciences, BS holders can publish, although it is REALLY hard. An MS in humanities is enough to get into major publications that PhDs get into but unlikely. A PhD doesn't guarantee you anything. 

The thing is, even with a PhD, you may be just another person with a blog saying shit few people care about. With a BA/BS, no one will care. With a PhD, a few people might care.

The point of school isn't so much the learning in a structured format (semester learning, building on last semester etc) but networking and learning the format of academia. Making the right connections. And even with all that, you can end up nowhere (I have two friends who graduated in two different humanities programs at Harvard in the past three years and one is a freelancer who mainly tutors rich kids writing college admission letters or edits journal articles etc and the other is trying to start a publishing business in his field, but he's been trying for 3 years now). I remember a story the freelancer told me awhile ago when he first started his PhD at Harvard. He was at one of Harvard's libraries (we have over 100 of them) and he was talking to the librarian and he found out the librarian has a PhD from Harvard. He thought ""what a fucking loser, what is wrong with him?"" Then in his last year of grad school when applying for jobs and getting nowhere, he realized, that is the state of academia today.

No matter what, you can have your blog and some people might read it. You'll feel good about it. But I guarantee you within a year in industry, your blog will dry up into obsolesce and you'll no longer have the energy, desire or insight to write it anymore.

All this is bad, but there are options at most universities. While many of them are inadequate (even at Harvard, just read the crimson or whatever to see the failings of Harvard Mental Health Services, they exist). Here at Harvard we have the Bureau of Study Council that can help you focus better and make better use of your time, therapists that you can see (albeit not often) that specialize in what students go through, pharmacology management, etc. And your health insurance works off campus (and honestly, you are probably better off going the off campus route to a major hospital that can help, in Boston, BWH, MGH or even McLean—they all have outpatient options). 

If you take nothing else from this, remember this: What you are going through is not unique. You are not a freak, you are not a loser, nor a poser and you are reaching out, which is what you should be doing. You *can* get a PhD, it will require a lot of hard work, dedication and lonely nights, but you *can* do it! And if it doesn't happen, you are not destined for failure; life has a funny way of working out.

Lastly, even the top people in the field have suffered with depression through school, whether it be in undergrad, during their PhD when research is stalling, or even as professors. You are not alone. While you’ll never know who I am, I can promise you I’ve dealt with depression and I have an MD/PhD from Harvard and MIT and I’m on faculty at Harvard Medical School, while working at a busy pain practice in academic medicine teaching pain fellows and teaching resident anesthesiologists.

well, first things first: you've got to take care of yourself, seems like your mental health is not optimal, and has been weighing down on the odds of you finishing. I understand there is more than just this (you mentioned finances) but to be honest the way you describe your relationship with your advisors suggests that you've had unrealistic goals. In phd, you're the driver. 

Also keep in mind it's ok to not have a phd, and it's ok to leave a phd program. I heard the figure of 1/3 of phd candidates never finishing their program (I don't know if this is accurate) but you're not at all an isolated case. 

I think you've outlined your trajectory quite well (it's harsh so it must be honest), and to be frank it does not seem (at least in my field, seems the same in yours) to be productive and consistent enough to be recruited as a permanent research/teaching staff (although YMMV of course).

BUT

There are plenty of great careers for people with an understanding for research and/or a knack for teaching. I know of a few scientific writers/journalists, technical manual writers, commercial agents, development engineers,... They're all essential to the scientific community.

I think it boils down to talking to your advisors about your ideas and plans as soon as possible.

I must make assumptions here: ""Mental Health Act"" has different names in US states, so you must be in the UK or other country with a national MHA. I also assume your country has uni and legal policies similar to the US.  I can only explain in terms of what I know in the US, so you need to find the equivalent in your country to what I say below. 

Clinical depression (i.e. at least moderate severity) is an official medical disease diagnosis in every country, when diagnosed by a licensed medical or mental health provider. When clinical depression is severe, causes suicidal thoughts, and requires hold or hospitalization, there is no question that it IS life threatening - and then qualifies both for EMERGENCY MEDICAL LEAVE, and as a MEDICAL DISABILITY (because it requires long-term treatment, not overnight treatment). This needs to be applied to your situation.

First, some things I want to tell you:  Please stop bashing yourself.         When a person has strong thoughts of suicide, they are not able to act rationally at that time.  So you did have a very valid reason to act and freeze up the way you did on exam day.  The day you were held in the ER, your illness WAS extremely serious and life threatening (suicide risk always is) i.e. a most “excruciating circumstance”. 

If you were my patient, or my student (and you volunteered this info and asked for my advice), I would advise the following steps:

1) apply for retroactive emergency medical leave, to a date just prior to your initial exam date (I don’t understand why your accessibility advisor told you to request an actual withdrawal, when all you need to do is take final exams (more about this later).      In your cover letter explain it this way:     a) You did not know how ill you were when you first requested deferred exams, and     b) In fact you required hospitalization shortly thereafter for a life-threatening disease, for which you will have to undergo further treatment before you can return for exams.    c) You will be attaching a letter from your physician that also states this, as well as to state that    d) Your medical diagnosis is severe enough to qualify as a disability. 

In the US, you would be given an “I” placeholder for “incomplete” grade, to be changed to your actual grade when you are better and take the tests later (but you will have a time limit on this, check).

2) In the US, privacy laws (FERPA, HIPAA) permit you to withhold your specific diagnosis and suicide risk/hold from your school and anyone else. A physician who knows your severe depression diagnosis and hospitalization, only needs to write a letter (or complete the university’s form) stating this: that you had a “life-threatening medical diagnosis” as in 1.c)-d) above. (It would be your choice whether to disclose details.  The school would not have ability to request your medical records.

3) In the US, universities are required to give “reasonable accommodation” for a medically-caused disability, via that uni’s policies that are typically modeled after US federal education / work policies (i.e. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)). 

So: what is “reasonable accommodation” in your case? Typically, measures that lower stress but accomplish the same assessment goals - i.e. more time between exams (days rather than a literal minute), and longer exam times: (example - permit 33% - 50% more time to take each exam);  and anything else reasonable that you determine with your mental health professional. Maybe in your case, oral exams - I’m not sure.  And possibly lower class load each semester. Your physician would likely need to list specifics. However, you would be expected to complete and know all of the material for each course and degree.  Also, I would suggest requesting some helpful discussions with your faculty advisors as to less stressful options on your future career path.

MOST IMPORTANT:
You MUST seek, and stay in, long-term treatment. Having suicidal thoughts and incapacitating reactions is very serious. You will get better, but you do need some recovery time as it will not happen overnight, and will not happen without extensive treatment. ",7,2018-07-01 12:01:24,AskAcademia

&amp;#x200B;

In short, yes, it is way worse than in the US in terms of job availability. Realistically, *you will not get the job unless you are a Canadian citizen or permanent resident prior to your application.* This is because Canadian universities are state-run and therefore strictly must make a strong case that there is not an equally-qualified candidate among the Canadian talent pool if they are going to sponsor you for a work permit. You're probably not going to qualify for permanent residency express entry without a few years of domestic work experience under your belt either, so realistically this is a challenge if you want to aim for a TT position.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as discrimination, it depends what you mean by discrimination. There are really good benefits associated with maternity, decent mental health support, decent disability protection, etc. Work hours and flexibility are going to be essentially the same as any TT job in the US or Europe. Health case is public and paid for by taxes; you can get insurance through university employers which will cover dental, mental health care, prescriptions, etc., but heath care in general is public. This is obviously not the case in the US. There is currently a major push to hire diversely, which includes women candidates and candidates from ethnic minorities; this seems to apply in the US as well.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the big issue with hiring (aside from the challenges associated with landing a job if you are not a citizen/PR) is that there just are not a lot of jobs in Canada. There are maybe a dozen major research institutions in the entire country, and some smaller community college style schools, but there just isn't the same sort of abundant private school and SLAC culture you have in the US. Schools are essentially all public at the provincial level and funded by a combination of provincial taxes and relatively low tuition. Many courses end up being taught by adjunct faculty because there simply isn't budget allocation at the state level to pay for faculty and because tuition rates are legally frozen at the provincial level. Additionally there is a whole class of postdoctoral fellow in Canada, the Banting Fellowships, which serve to transition a postdoc into a professorship role; these fellowships generally transition seamlessly into professorships without an open search. So, most of the actual hires at the TT level don't happen through open searches.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, it's a decent system if you are in the top 10% of your field AND are a Canadian citizen/PR AND have the time to wait around for the job to open up AND are eligible/competitive for a Banting or are willing to adjunct it up at an institution for years on soft money.

I can't get rid of it entirely, but I reduce it significantly. My immediate supervisors are aware of the condition and have the necessary contacts, but they don't know more than that. Knowing the specifics of my childhood abuse doesn't help them to help me, and it only muddies the professional relationship. 

That's what it means to have a serious mental illness or psychiatric condition: it's not a card you can play for pity or leniency unless you're willing to pay the price for it. For a lot of mental health issues, you risk losing considerable standing just for admitting to a mental health *diagnosis*, let alone for venting all of your intimate traumas and life story. 

OP needs to know that risk because once you say something, you can never take it back. If you share a very intimate detail about your life and then people act awkwardly or start to see you as fragile and a lesser student, you can't go back in time. 

Once OP actually has this conversation with their mental health team, they'll be told the same thing: discussions about disability need to focus on the accommodations that'll help you. If you're going to talk about being depressed, you need to also talk about what steps you're taking to deal with it (e.g. ""I'm currently seeking ongoing treatment"") and the specific things that'll help you (e.g. ""It'd be very helpful if you could post lecture recordings""). 

Any discussions that deal with the condition in more detail need to be had with a health professional, not your Economics 101 professor. Anyone who is not trained to supply psychotherapy could inadvertently do a lot of harm, and they have the added difficulty that they don't really know OP or their complete medical history. Wanting to air all of their dirty laundry to what may be a professional contact is incredibly foolish, and OP needs to know that they definitely *should not* share those details until they've discussed it with a health professional who actually knows their condition.

It is appropriate to let her know the true reason for your absence. Don't unburden your problems on her, but just let her know in brief. Do seek counseling from the university ASAP. If you already have been doing this, you might be able to get a note from them explaining your situation in clinical terms while preserving your privacy as much as possible. 

PI's often have to deal with students cracking under the stress. I've known plenty of cases where PI's have been sympathetic about mental health issues. Possibly because many of them have been in a similar place in grad school. I've known a case where a young woman grad student developed such severe anxiety that she couldn't leave her room for weeks. Her PI negotiated with the university to make sure she wasn't in trouble. She managed to coax her student out of her room and drove her to the airport so she could fly back home. After recovering at home for a semester, the student was able to come back to school the following year. The same PI took her back and she went to publish and defend successfully.

I'm not sure if this counts as a stupid reason or a practical reason, but I think there is also an element of social capital. When people meet you and find out you have a PhD, they automatically assume that you are a smart and reasonable person with good opinions about stuff. 

And having a PhD opens up a lot of doors. Most of the people I went to grad school with aren't in academia, but they have jobs like consulting that the PhD helped them get, despite not being a necessary precondition for the job.

Specific to your situation, I think the problems you described are (1) surmountable in your current position, and (2) not exclusive to grad school. As you recognized, you could go to a different job and be equally uninspired, and you also won't end up with a PhD as a result of slogging through that job.

I see lots of people who post here who are in desperate or unfixable situations -- abusive supervisors, funding crises, mental health catastrophes, etc. -- and when the problem is unsolvable, the person should get out.

* Respect. eg: I missed a bunch of class due to illness. Fine: being held responsible for missed work when I only contacted the professor after the deadline; not fine -- a TA publicly dressing me down when I got back. Or in orientation, spelling out a strict honor code vs preemptively assuming that the listener will attempt to cheat.  
* Feeling in control of my academic career. Includes having academic responsibilities and rights clearly conveyed, responsive advisors &amp; admin, and a clear appeals process.  
* Clear expectations for grading, conveyed through rubrics, office hours, written feedback, model assignments, or frequent evaluations.  
* Direction and context. Obviously this is mostly internal, but stuff like career advice or course syllabi/paths that explain what employable skills you'll learn helped.  
* Specific supports, like career counselling, advising sessions, time-management workshops, or ombudsperson contact.

I have type II bipolar, which on the meds I currently take means I just get depressed for a few days a month and can get quite bad anxiety. The meds also make me quite tired. 

Do you plan on staying in the UK?  (that's where I'm assuming you are from your mention of England). If so, most UK universities are very accepting of disabilities for a start, and you can get a lot of support, from the course or university in general. I for instance have a mental health mentor (who is a bit like a study coach with more of a focus on the health side, but not a counsellor), got counselling sessions with the university, and have a named person of contact who is not my supervisor. The UK is also good for having more than one person in charge of your postgraduate studies: for a PhD for instance you would likely have a committee in charge of your progress through the degree, instead of just your PhD supervisor. 

My supervisor for my research project has turned out to be quite awful, we have virtually no contact and he's previously suggested I was intellectually inferior to my peers after meeting for 5 minutes, and has told me to aim to achieve lower than everyone else due to my health. I complained about it just today, and have had meetings with several people who are varying degrees of appalled by what he said, and people are trying to sort out what to do next. My advice for this kind of situation is two-fold: 1. pick a supervisor for undergraduate project/ postgraduate research project very carefully, try and make sure you'll get on with them, and try to determine whether they're more the involved type, or more detached. I know now I should have gone with someone more involved. 2. Don't be afraid to let people know that you might need additional support, the worst that can happen is that nothing happens. I kept my supervisor's behaviour to myself for a bit too long, now I know I should have reached out sooner. 

One piece of potentially worse news: after 3 months in a lab, I'm coming to see that my dream of working a combined teaching and research position in academia is maybe not for me. Academia is fierce, very competitive and high pressure. Not only am I not good at dealing with such pressure on a daily basis, I think that my health issues make me lack a competitive advantage. I can probably work 40 hours/week (excluding reading etc) tops, and I cannot compete with those that put in 80 hours.

dn5vn3a,PurrPrinThom,,"When you’re applying for a PhD, you shouldn’t be looking for a program, you should be looking for a supervisor. While your program is important in that the school and the program you choose will affect what funding is available to you and (if in North America) what coursework will be required, your supervisor trumps all of that. 

There’s no point in finding a program you love if it doesn’t have a supervisor who is interested in, or able to properly supervise your topic. That should be your number one priority. Since you already have a specific interest and fairly clear idea of what you should do, you should seek out the academics who have published work that resonates with you, and see where they are. Your former/current professors will be invaluable in this regard.

In terms of finding a good fit, generally that means making sure that you feel comfortable in the program/school. This of course means finding a supervisor that you feel you can work with – not just a supervisor whose research interests align with yours, but someone you feel you can work with. It also means seeking out a department that potentially holds something else for you: if your supervisor goes on sabbatical, or unexpectedly falls ill, will you be alone in miserable in your department or will there be someone else you can temporarily turn to? Likewise location. You cannot underestimate the amount that location matters. While moving halfway across the country to a small city where you know no one and there’s very little going on in said city may seem like not a big deal when considering schools, actually moving there might make you feel isolated and alone and negatively impact your mental health, and therefore productivity.

dqsxblk,the_Stick,,"Once upon a time before I entered graduate school when I was working as a research associate, I met a girl who was in graduate school.  She asked me to help her change the rotors in the ultracentrifuge and I gladly helped.  Then I was suddenly her ""new best friend"" - whenever she needed help with anything, she came looking for me.  It was noticeable that she had latched on to me to the point where my friends were commenting.  There were some behaviors that raised red flags, so I politely distanced myself, but helped her out occasionally.

Gradually, I came to know more about her, especially since a few years down the road, I ended up joining the lab she had been in (but was gone by then).  She was smart and capable in lab but she had some issues that inhibited her ability to perform high-level research independently.  I am not sure exactly what her particular issues were, but when experiments did not work or when unexpected events occurred, she was prone to unhealthy behavior.  These included laying on the bathroom floor wailing and weeping and making statements to various staff about how she could get her knife/scalpel and cut them (she wasn't actually making threats, though they were perceived that way; it was just the way her mind responded to stress).  There were several other incidents, all triggered by the stress of things not working as she wanted them to.

Here's the difficulty.  In Ph.D. level research, a student needs to explore and investigate.  Part of that investigation is going down false avenues, finding out hypotheses are wrong, backtracking, troubleshooting and generally dealing with lots of ""failure.""  A good portion of doctoral-level work involves seeming butting one's head against a wall (this girl actually literally did that; but most grad students only do that figuratively).  If you are not in a healthy place, the stress of all this seemingly fruitless pursuit can be devastating.  It doesn't matter that it's not the student's fault and that it's not fair; it just isn't a healthy fit.

So what happened to this girl?  After the police got involved during one of her more erratic outbursts, her advisor sat her down and discussed career goals.  I'm not privy to the details, but she switched from a Ph.D. track to a Master's track (students in this program were accepted directly from undergrad to Ph.D. and couldn't actually apply for an M.S. though many eventually shifted to an M.S.).  What she had accomplished was mostly enough for a master's thesis.  She struggled through a few more assays with some mentoring and supervision (and a bit of handholding) and was awarded her master's degree.

Here's the happy ending.  So long as things were predictable and ran smoothly, she was fine; it was only when things were wildly out of control that she became... wildly out of control.  She landed a job in a pharmaceutical company overseeing batch testing or quality control or something similar.  And she excelled.  The environment was right for her mental health and the job she did was predictable and routine.  It's been many years, but I know she worked there (happily!) for at least seven years.

So here's the takeaway message:  Not everyone is in the right place for a Ph.D.  That's not an elitist statement or a condemnation or anything.  It's just that to do it successfully, one has to have the right environment, support, health, and personality.  If your issues are preventing you from successfully independently pushing back the frontiers of knowledge, maybe it's time to re-assess your goals.  Take a critical examination of your life, where you want to go and how you can get there.  What do you need to do to be in a place where you are healthy enough for the work of a Ph.D.?  

I have seen students who looked headed for disaster find ways to get to a healthy place.  I want to encourage you, because you can do it.

(Personal things you can do in parallel: lean on your family/close friends; think about what you would love to do for the next six months/one year if you faced no external pressure; make sure that your short term goals are your own and not some random checklist of prestige.) Your advisor, professors, counsellors, and physicians want you to succeed. However, the school probably can't let you magically pass if you miss the requirements by a large margin. This might give the appearance that you have an adversarial relationship with the school, but that would be the wrong conclusion. You'll have to work with them to find a solution sooner or later, so the best thing to do is just go forward and discuss your options with your advisor while simultaneously taking care of your mental and physical health.

I noticed that your posts place heavy emphasis on career steps (e.g. working long hours at a PE shop and earning a return offer). I'll venture a guess that part of your hesitance to consider medical leave stems from fear of potentially derailing a hot career trajectory. If that's the case, let me assure you 100% that taking care of yourself is the stronger play in the short, medium, and long term. Even if this involves doing things like taking time off or graduating a semester later.

d7r3y8v,NotQuirkyJustAwkward,t2_grara,"Firstly- You obviously need to find help for your anxiety. Look online for sliding scale or free mental health services in your town. I'm very lucky to live in LA where there's an abundance of social service programs. You might also try asking a higher-up in the psych department for suggestions. Otherwise, use websites such as IPrevail.com, which gives you the opportunity to chat with peers and counselors as a sort of online therapy. I've had some success with ""self-help"" books that are basically manuals for cognitive behavioral therapy, some even written for specific illnesses such as GAD or MDD.  Mindfulness meditation sounds super hippie-dippie and I hate it, but it shows results pretty consistently in cognitive neuroscience studies. Please go to your school's student services office and ask to speak with a counselor about disability accommodations. They give your professors a letter that simply says you belong to their program, and that you need ______ as an accommodation. They'll let you know what's standard or appropriate, and in my experience that's 1.5x time on tests, testing in a private room, extra considerations on absences or late work, and the ability to leave class to stop an oncoming panic attack. 

Second- An advisor who writes back saying they figured if you didn't show up, there was a good reason, is an advisor who genuinely respects and cares about you. And if she DOES chew you out in person, it's because she's hoping the ""tough love"" approach might work better for you. Please, please don't blow it out of proportion when you talk to her. Catastrophizing and repeatedly apologizing does no good. It puts the person in a place from being upset with you, to babying you to make you feel better. A good, direct statement will do wonders. 

""I greatly apologize for having missed our appointment, I really appreciate you taking the time out of your schedule and I want you to know that I do respect your time. I'm going to try to be more diligent about my commitments in the future, since keeping appointments on my phone's calendar doesn't seem to work well enough."" You've avoided the cliche ""I'm so sorry"" that people throw around haphazardly, shown her respect and appreciation, explained what went wrong only after stating how you plan to prevent the problem in the future so it doesn't come off as an excuse. It's hard for someone to lecture you after you've covered pretty much every grievance they might have. 

Please realize that this isn't just for her good, but for yours as well. Rumination leads to stress, and stress is what caused your problem. I know it feels impossible at times, but you need to get in the habit of forgetting and forgiving your mistakes. One of the easiest ways to do this is imagine you end up with that person's position, and a student just did the same thing. Would you be furious? Would you be okay with knowing that this student just had a sobbing panic attack over it? Would you tell them to just drop out now because they've destroyed their life by missing a meeting? 

Finally, it's not true that there's no crying in academia. What IS true is that there is a tremendous amount of pressure, a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety, and a heartbreaking number of suicides in academia. And it's terrible that we have a self-perpetuating stigma of mental illness makes us feel shame, so we are ashamed of our mental illness, which makes us think that mental illness is shameful. It is not. Diabetes and depression/anxiety can be caused intrinsically or extrinsically, and (with the exception of relating to obesity)intrinsically we don't tell people to hide their diabetes. Depression and anxiety have real-life effects on your physical health, and you shouldn't treat it like a cold that shouldn't slow you down and will go away soon. If you'd like, you can reach out to me anytime. But do reach out to someone, even strangers online. You need to see that you aren't alone, and that you're already excelling by ""mentally fit"" standards. 

Take care.

d6qct5q,cletus-cubed,t2_4rmkr,"PI here, so I'll drop my 2 cents in. First, let me assure you that R1 vs. R3 has nothing to do with it. All PhDs are rigorous and all have the same trials and tribulations. Some students will breeze through in an R1 and that same person may have problems in an R2 because it's not so much about the individual program, it's about jumping through the hoops, proving you have the chops for research, and who you match up with. 

In terms of finding a lab, everyone wants a student who works hard, is reasonably intelligent, and will be an asset in the lab not a pain in the ass for the next five years. A lot of the bad habits that annoy your PI will likely be chalked up to naivete and they will assume you'll grow out of them. One piece of advice given to me is to look for anything that annoys me, multiply it by 10, and if I could live with it then the student is fine. Right now my rotation student is an ""interruptor"", presumably because she wants to demonstrate how much she knows. That's something I can deal with, I'm pretty sure the post-doc already mentioned it to her. 

In regards to your specific problem... keep in mind that everything you think you know about how a student should be treated can now be thrown out the window. No one wants to see a student treated badly of course, but you are looking for a relationship like none other, your mentor wields a lot of power and you have very little. They can get by with a lot. I've seen all sorts of bad behavior get swept under the rug, and even if it's not, the student always comes out with the worse, even if they are in the right. 

So from my perspective, you should keep any mental health issue to yourself until it gets to be an issue. There's no reason why the PI shouldn't accommodate this, but don't give them any reason to reject you before they commit. If I felt my student might not be mentally stable all the time it would definitely affect my decision. I would also suggest you keep it to yourself in dealing with other students. New PhD students can be very gossipy. You want your PI to base the decision on your abilities, and not some perceived or mis-perceived notion. 

At some point you will obviously have to show folks your arms, there's no way to go 4+ years without them seeing it sometime. But get in a lab first. Also, be prepared for awkward questions. Scientists can sometimes be very socially incompetent and they may ask something inappropriate, you may want to have a practiced response.

e8coez7,xbloodsugar,t2_29yccvlx,"Thought I'd comment as I used to be interested in clinical psychology too (but have now since moved on to quantitative psychology)!

I'm not from America but if you are - from what I understand, you're going to need a clinical psychology PhD to be able to practice treatment of mental disorders. If you aren't, many places are moving towards that sort of certification as well, so you might want to consider that (especially since you mentioned that you do not want to leave your job just yet). A clinical psychology PhD is one of the most demanding PhDs in psychology and also one that can take quite a few years (since it involves practice and research).

Also, psychology has largely moved past Freud - you might want to check out some more updated materials on the treatment of mental illnesses. 

Most importantly if you are serious about entering the field as a practitioner, I highly recommend that you go beyond book-reading and consider volunteering in perhaps mental health centres or the like. I used to volunteer for a few and I got to help plan activities and interact with people who were battling depression, schizophrenia, etc. It was also good to be able to find out from the professionals on the field how their day-to-day jobs were like and think seriously about whether this was the career path for me. I would also recommend for you to eventually get some research experience in the area since placements for clinical psych PhDs are highly competitive.

For me in the end I decided it was not for me. But as a prof once told me, there are many ways to help these individuals besides working directly with them as a clinical psychologist.

If you’re struggling in any of these areas, put education to the side.  Get treated, get functional, and maintain for a year before looking at school again.  Type 2, is it managed?
2.  An associates is a respectable degree!  Can you do what you would like with it?
3.  Is it your goal to finish undergrad or are you fulfilling a promise to your grandfather.  If you do this, you have to be in it for your own reasons...a degree has to be more important to you than it is to wanting to please someone else.  Your grandfather sounds amazing but is he accepting?
4.  What type of support system do you have?  Are you accepted and supported?  If not, I would start looking for that support from other people and communities.  There is a great bipolar community here.

OP, I think before you can find answers to these questions about school and work, you need to make mental health your first priority.  If it is great!  If it isn’t,  I can empathize bc making decisions when symptomatic is often impossible or unwise.  Can you talk to your grandfather?  Is he supportive?  And finally you have to establish a support system that you can rely on.  That knows you, supports you, guides you and keeps you compliant if needed.  I think if you address these things first, you will find there are interdisciplinary majors that would allow you to combine your interests.  Set some measurable goals and truly figure out is school is the best avenue at this time.  Once I stopped living by someone else’s definition of time, I made much more progress!

ct6x5oe,AlwaysPutSaltInUrEye,t2_46vlr,"Absolutely agree. A year or two ago I remember [this article](http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/mar/01/mental-health-issue-phd-research-university) going viral. Although there are few studies on the subject, the ""culture of acceptance"" for struggling in academia rang true for a lot of people.

It's something I have been thinking about a lot lately. Not only do many people feel powerless because of the issues they are facing, but many also (including myself) feel powerless to do anything about it. I mean, we can set up support groups and mentoring programs, but [there is evidence](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26365-lighting-dark-fixing-academias-mental-health-problem/) to suggest that these might not really help all that much. There is still isolation, fear of appearing weak (both personally and professionally), alienation, &amp;c. &amp;c.   

I agree with azendel that the very structure of academia - its culture, procedures, professional expectations, &amp;c. - needs to change before these issues can be fully addressed.

A - no one who hasn't done a PhD will understand. Fuck them and their shitty opinions, ""you only work 1 hour per day how can you say it's hard?"" They never had the courage to try so ignore them. Listen only to other people who have done a PhD and I guarantee every single one will tell you it was really hard. Because it is really hard.

B - Don't beat yourself up over it. if you are struggling that's fine. That's ok. I imagine you see yourself as this really smart person who just makes it all look easy and everyone thinks that makes you cool. And that's fine for the kiddy crap but this is proper research. It's hard. So hard most people are incapable of it. Have pride in that. You have found the edge of your abilities. Now who do you want to be?

ctbri8m,Vitalchimie,t2_ap1lc,"I'm no expert, but I've gotten a solid sense over the years that most people in academia are primarily interested in how you have been trending within the most recent 2-3 years. That is to say, if you spend a few semesters succeeding in the relevant coursework and explain your situation to any potential lab manager/PI, then he/she will almost certainly disregard whatever hangups you had in the past. You need to prove to a potential mentor that you have worked through your mental health issues, or at the least that you have it under control to the point where it won't affect your work. If you're as passionate about learning as you say, then this shouldn't be a problem :D

And honestly, don't worry at all about switching fields. When I was a freshman I had the opportunity to interview a Psychology professor who told me about how he spent he spent the first few decades of his life studying/working as an engineer, then just up and decided to jump into a Psychology PhD with very little background in the field. Your case is different in a few details, but the point is this: If you love to learn, and are passionate about a new field then it really doesn't matter if you studied something else earlier in life. It's never too late to jump into a different academic discipline, just know that it may be significantly harder as you get older due to a changing lifestyle (you want to settle down and have kids, don't have the energy to work/study long days, etc.). If those issues don't affect you, then you should definitely be able to get out there and live your dreams!

Work dissatisfaction (and mental health issues, candidly) were very shockingly common in this group.  It was really alarming. I'm not sure the humanities scholar's life (particularly during the Visiting assistant professor pre-tenure phases) is all it's cracked up to be in the 2020 academic landscape, particularly if you are a person who is predisposed to depression. Life in so many departments is marred by hugely unpleasant politics, yet jobs in fields like English are so rare that if you find yourself at one of these places you have no mobility. You don't have the option to move to escape as you would in nearly any other job so many people become effectively trapped in toxic environments.

Also, you're making a ton of incorrect assumptions based on limited or simply bad information. First, there are plenty of interesting jobs in different industries that would welcome a top liberal arts school grad who studied English.

I realized in grad school that I'd been dealing with depression since I was about 17 in some form, which is strange since in undergrad I was very close to two roommates who had undergone treatment for depression. Somehow I didn't see the signs or recognize what was going on with me at the time. Experiences when I was 17-18 exacerbated my depression/anxiety, then I cycled in and out of it throughout undergrad, but it was still ""manageable"" in the sense it didn't impact my grades or ability to perform well. 

When I started graduate school, I joined an awful lab that was terrible for my mental health and realized I couldn't just keep going as I had and as a last resort saw a doctor and got on anti-depressants, then therapy, for both depression and anxiety. Then I left the lab I was in and got into a much better environment and weaned off the anti-depressants during the second to last year of my PhD. I still have anxiety and depressive tendencies, but the tools I learned while I was taking anti-depressants and in therapy let me handle those a lot better now for the most part, although I'll admit I still sometimes ""crash"" for a few days and need to take a mental health day every now and then.

The minimum I would say is along the lines of: ""I have recently been dealing with a health condition. I'm receiving care from a doctor, and I am hopeful that my condition will improve. At the same time, I'm aware that my condition has affected my ability to complete work recently, and so I wanted to touch base with you and establish some new deadlines that feel realistic. I want to assure you that I am really passionate about the work we're doing, and I look forward to continuing to work on these projects.""

With that, you let your advisor know what's going on in terms specific enough that they're not in the dark, but generic enough that they don't know it's a mental health condition, specifically. I think it's important that you at least say something -- if you say nothing, your advisor will still notice you're behind but may attribute that to something else (e.g., laziness, disorganization, etc.). This way, you let him know that there is a health-related reason.

It's up to you if you want to share more, such as that this is a mental health concern, specifically, or your specific diagnoses of depression and anxiety. Ideally, there wouldn't be a stigma to sharing mental health diagnoses--it is completely appropriate to share these and you have every right to do so--and I am also cognizant that the stigma is real, as well as the fact that you may not feel comfortable sharing some of the details.

In so much of our culture, we’re taught to expect frequent congratulations and plaudits.

In academic life, any outcome or achievement takes a lot of time.

I understand the frustration with taking subjects you think you already took in school, but the truth is, they will go into more detail at every step of the way. In undergrad they will go deeper than in school, in postgrad they will go deeper than in undergrad.

fo9hlnw,Rec0nSl0th,t2_yry3o,"I’m not in a lab environment so I can’t help there but I do have bipolar and work in social science research/teaching so I can give insight there. Bipolar is really hard to gain a balance with. If I’m not medicated and paying close attention to my mental health hygiene, I would naturally fall into either depression or mania. Depression is as much physical as it is mental. You have less energy, less resilience against things that normally don’t bother you, less ability to “make” yourself do what you know you need to do. This all clicks for me in what you mention about not making lab hours, taking feedback badly and seeming apathetic. 

There’s also mania which looks like thinking you’re doing really well regardless of evidence, talking fast/a lot, not being attentive to others and feeling super connected to everyone. I’ve put in enough work to realise when I’m falling into this pattern of behaviour and to realise my mania is not reality but it can be hard to recognise and might need medication to balance out. This clicks with the talking in the lab and thinking they need/can reinvent the wheel better than established procedures etc. 

Now, the thing is mental health hygiene is the responsibility of the person with the mental health issue. This person has a number of diagnoses so it’s probably trickier to manage. I had been stable for about 7-8 years before going to grad school and I have a lot of tools that I use daily. I take my meds, I engage with therapy if I need to and manage myself pretty strictly. It doesn’t sound like this person has as much proficiency around managing their mental health and Grad school is a *very* difficult place to learn those skills because of the pressure and constant critical feedback. I’ll also say that working from home has been detrimental to my mental health even with all my tools. The not showing up to meetings might look like not actually being able to get out of bed (yes, this can be a symptom of depression). 

If you are required to manage research output, I would give clear tasks and deadline. Offer resources such as counselling/medical services if available through your university. If need be, document their failed deadlines. If they fail to meet them, give them the same task (not new ones) until they finish the existing task. I’m not familiar with a lab environment so I’m sorry if this wouldn’t work but consequences for inaction, especially if they’re being clearly communicated, is helpful for both of you. Being a stubborn but calm PITA until you get what you want will help you. I wouldn’t engage any emotions in any of it and have prepared responses if they get unprofessionally emotional at you.

I also sometimes have a low attention span when I start  and can get really obsessive about little things that don't actually  advance the process and waste a lot of time in various ways even though  I'm giving it my all.

In my personal opinion, based on this information, I think you *should* talk to a therapist. You're grieving, dealing with a (suspected) mental illness, and under a lot of stress for your degree. Plus, I bet the current state of global affairs isn't helping things at the moment.

I'm sure you've been giving this your all, but I think if an outsider is recognizing things that you yourself are recognizing as well, then you should take that into consideration. I don't think your advisor saying this was a jab at your intelligence; I think they're expressing concern.

Inconsistent output (doing great work sometimes and then going silent other times), in my case is from being bipolar (""beneficial hypomania"").  Bad at estimating completion times (perfectionism).

diokiu3,Tabarnouche,t2_cccu6,"I just graduated after struggling for 6 years through a PhD program that was supposed to take 4 years. I struggled with imposter syndrome for probably the first 5 years of the program. For a long time, I didn't feel like an academic; I felt like an actor pretending to be an academic. After a lot of soul-searching and taking steps to address mental health problems, I've come to believe that, paradoxically, my case of imposter syndrome was the result of pride. I had this image of success and what an academic is/should be, and I tied all my self worth to how closely I matched that image, and, in particular, whether I was keeping up with my peers: ""Are their research ideas better than mine? How many working papers do they have? How many conferences are they attending? How many fly-outs did they get on the job market?"" The more I compared myself, the more anxiety, discouragement, and self-doubt I felt. I compared myself constantly, and I've realized that tendency to compare was a manifestation of pride, which encourages unhealthy comparison from the top down (""I'm better than you"") AND from the bottom up (""You're better than me"").

Over the past year, I've taken several steps to improve my well-being (e.g., going to a counselor--both individually and with my wife, taking medication for depression, exercising more, eating better, cutting out video games, developing a new hobby, etc.). In addition, I've come to several realizations which have helped me divorce my ego from my academic/career prospects: 

* I can only control the inputs to my career, not the outcomes.
* My job is a means to an end. It only matters to the extent that it supports the things I truly care about and which bring me the most satisfaction--developing meaningful relationships, being challenged intellectually, feeling like I'm progressing in some measurable way. 
* The people I care about most couldn't give a rat's ass about how much money I make or how good of a researcher I am. They loved me before I tried to be an academic and they love me still, so why am I fooling myself into believing I can somehow earn their affection and respect if I'm an awesome researcher? They only want me to be happy (for their sake and mine), so if I *am* going to care about what other people want of me, I should at leasts make my focus on being happy, not on being an amazing researcher.
* My expectations for what it means to ""make an impact"" need to be properly calibrated. By that I mean, as a social science researcher, frankly, my research doesn't matter much in the grand scheme of things. That may sound cynical, but it's simply a reality of the field I study. I'd argue that even the research of even the most successful academics in my field makes very little measurable impact on the world. I do believe, however, that I can make an impact on myself (by learning and progressing) and my students in the classroom. So I've tried to shift my focus toward those ends. 

The only advice I will offer is to read the book, [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck](http://a.co/bOIGvTG). I read the book recently after working through a lot of my imposter syndrome issues, but the book was thought-provoking, and it resonated with my experience. I think any driven, high-achieving person who ties a lot of self-worth to their achievements could benefit from reading it. ",6,2017-06-09 17:14:12,AskAcademia
e3z88sk,Weaselpanties,t2_5w94f,"What everyone else is saying is true; avoid burnout by not doing the things that make people burn out. Believe it or not, there are ample studies now that show that working more than 40 hours a week long-term not only has diminishing returns (imagine that by hour 10 of a 12-hour day, you're only actually getting 15 minutes worth of work done), but also takes a steep mental health toll. Long story short, you won't get more done, and you'll suffer for it anyway. There are times when working 18 hours a day are inevitable, like some kinds of field work and the occasional hard push in the lab (I ran an assay that took 39 hours once... in a row, with 5 people coming and going to help me) but I'm talking about your day-in-day-out routine. Keep those hours in check, take weekends off, and take a week off twice a year, to keep burnout at bay.  


I also want to add that when you love your work AND you give yourself plenty of space around it, you end up thinking, reading, and talking about your work a great deal in your free time. Free time is when my best brainstorming happens. So you'll be a better and more creative researcher if you have unstructured time, with plenty of space for thinking and reading.

There is a specific programme and department for skills development, which provides (among many other things) mentoring for those staying in **and** leaving academia; courses like you suggest on leadership, budgets, etc.; they organise weekly profiles with people who have gone into industry, and you can go to careers/CV advice sessions (one on one).

e9okm3s,natebam,t2_zlbx2,"Hey friend, I'm sorry you're feeling down. Grad school can be difficult. Here is my advice, as a current grad student.

1. Find something to get involved with outside of grad school commitments. I know, it sounds counterproductive because you're adding something else to your plate. But, it helps me a lot. I sing in a local chorus and we rehearse once a week and that makes my entire week better. Give yourself that outlet.

2. Make sure to stay socially connected with people outside of grad school. I am currently struggling with this because, as a natural introvert, I don't want to be around people after a long week of class and work. But it's going to be healthy for you to be around people you love and care about most. 

3. Seek mental health resources. Grad students are put under so much pressure. You are not weak for seeking help; no one is expecting you to be be strong all of the time. Remember to voice your needs to your advisor; in my opinion, they should be one of your main guides. 

4. Try to plan a fun little event or trip. Sometimes physically removing yourself from the environment temporarily can work wonders. I love to travel and I have found dirt-cheap flights and AirBnBs and it's refreshing for the soul to just be somewhere else for a while.

e07awpy,olusso,t2_123adf,"I agree with other comments, I have diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depression this year, in a single year masters and a completely new university.

Although I went with medication and therapy it got worse and worse, and I don’t know what would’ve happen if I didn’t go through with it. Probably I would drop out at some point at best. So go get her to the treatment and medication, in my case thinking about depression as a physical chronic illness helped, I would use painkillers if there was something wrong in my body wouldn’t I?

As for saying anyone lest her PI, NO! At first stages of my illness I was fucking so ashamed about it! Still nearly one year over it, I seem to forget how it is rest affecting my performance.  I fell like in a imposter syndrome, where I am a really bad and shady student that coming up with continuous excuses to just to pass. So it’s her choice to tell her condition, otherwise it will be worse for everyone. But to do that she had to accept first, and as first real step of acceptance go with the treatment. And in fact when you say your condition most of the people become overly understanding and tries to help, even the worst profs.  So I don’t know maybe drag her  stubborn ass (mine is still going strong,  r/depression helps) to a depression support group where people tell their stories and she will see she isn’t a special snowflake that got depression but It can happen to anyone.

Yet, for any hope to survive in academia she have to be completely open about her condition to department. As my condition got worse I had to say them, and if I wouldn’t I would seem as a liar and incompetent student because of the quality of the work I submit and increasing number of missed deadlines. I still have 15 days missed an essay, can you imagine justifying it in another case?
Also my mental health problems drained all my performance with lots another physical things, I’ve got hemorrhoids, physical injuries due to loss of balance, uncontrolled jests, panic attacks. In normal condition I would have finished that my last essay in one week, but now I blankly look on computer after 1 hour of work and I try to force myself I get a panic attack. In the end she cannot explain such performance problems with another white lie or she cannot try harder.  She had to say or will lose scholarships, degrees and respect. If she will say she will gain atmost respect; graduate life even demanding for normal people imagine going through it with a mental disability!

I went into this field full of hope and optimism.  At first, I loved the job because I enjoyed teaching.  But work-life balance is horrible as an adjunct.  Part of the problem is that I spend countless hours fine-tuning and adjusting everything in my course because I’m so invested in it.  And because I’m so invested in it, I end up working at home and on the weekends.  

At first I justified it as being passionate about the job.  Now I’ve realized that the physical and mental toll it has taken on me is incredibly bad for my health (physical and mental).  I have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts daily.  Got a cough and the constant lecturing made it take 6 months for it to go away because I had to keep using my voice.  The emotional burdens and stress of this job have caused me to develop frequent migraines and constant brain fog.  I can never take time off because of my schedule...and I can never take summers off because I can’t afford not to.  Then I realize I haven’t had a break or vacation in years.  I even have students that make MORE money than I do.

In that case, I'm not sure why you're getting any of your degrees. Your career goal is the type of job where the typical career path is still starting at entry level and working up, maybe picking up a master's along the way to be eligible for upper management roles. One reason for that is that the skills and concepts you're learning in the grad programs will have limited overlap with the day-to-day of the job. It's actually common to have applications from people who are clearly smart, but who would need a lot of extra training relative someone less credentialed but more experienced in industry, because what they have been trained to do fits for academia but not for an office job. To that end, most businesses wouldn't know what to do with somebody who is this credentialed but has no or limited work experience.

Try to find what's working well on the nicer days and do more of it. And try to find out what the connection is between you having a down day and coming across, to your students, as mean, and seek to stop those kinds of actions before they happen. (They may be subtle things! You might even, at some point, consider taping a few class sessions--all the easier if you are teaching remotely on Zoom right now.)

I do not think it makes sense to give a daily announcement of your emotional state. As another commenter remarked, this is essentially asking your students to manage or respond to your emotional state. If I were a student, I would feel some sense of slightly nervous anticipation wondering whether today my professor was going to say they were in a good mood or a bad mood. And I'd feel a bit on edge if they said they were in a bad mood.

That said, I do think it's good to convey your self-awareness to students in a way that is appropriate.

Each day I do my best to be present with you when I teach, and I'll continue to do that today, but my best today might not be the same as my best on other days. Know that I'll be flexible with you, too, if you're having an off-day."" An announcement like that, if it's once, maybe twice in a semester, shows self-awareness and humanizes you.

I think you did the right thing. You have invested a lot of time in Sarah, and seemed to have been very understanding and accommodating to her needs. 

As someone who has used the mental health resources at my university and gone through a rough personal patch in my graduate studies, I am sympathetic to her issues. I remember you saying she is new to Canada (she is from the States?), which can exasperate mental health issues and work productivity. It seemed like she was making use of her resources, and advocating for herself which is important, especially with the stigma attached to even getting academic help. At the same time, I have been an instructor who has dealt with students who have basically threatened me with complaining when I didn't give them the mark they thought they deserved.

It is disheartening to hear that it seems Sarah is basically throwing a temper tantrum when she didn't get her way. You seemed to have gone above and beyond your role as a Masters advisor (and in an unofficial role, I might add). Yes, we do not know what Sarah is going through. So let's not assume, but I do not agree with some posters here who've said that we shouldn't ""blame"" her for her reactions because her dreams have been dashed. 1) At this point, people have to take responsibility for their actions. She's not a child. I would think she's at least 22. In order to be a successful adult, researcher, and a grad student, Sarah needs to learn to take setbacks and failures with grace and maturity. It is a skill set that needs to be learned, and she doesn't have it (yet). Of course she can cry and yell at home, and even express extreme disappointment in front of you, but then to put the blame outwards and ostensibly threaten you - someone who has seemingly done nothing but try to listen and assist her - is very unprofessional and burns bridges. 2) Her failure should not be surprising, and it was more a fact of willful ignorance since she was struggling in many classes that she believed she could get accepted into a PhD program.

e5pd287,drarch,t2_rd1ha,"I'm in architecture. Before I was an adjunct for two years, I provided guest reviews for students, which was how I stayed engaged. I left professional practice to start a career in academia, starting out as an adjunct, thinking I'd like to one day be tenured. 

A couple years in and a funded PhD opportunity opened up, and I decided to pursue that. I also learned that tenure track positions are rare, especially in certain fields, and when they do open up it's even more rare for a former student to get that opportunity. I wasn't going to get it just by being present, even if I was a good former student. 

From a school's perspective, they will think it's better to use that faculty line and bring in an established outside talent to round out their faculty, rather than bring on a former student who is already willing to teach for little pay. Staying on as an adjunct and just hoping to get the tenure track job may set you up for disappointment down the road. 

While it's not impossible, I'd recommend two things. 

First, have an honest conversation with someone you trust to give tough but solid advice (preferably a department chair or someone that makes hiring decisions). Talk about your teaching/career aspirations, and how likely what you're trying to do is. Take it as constructive criticism, but not gospel. I was told (in grad school) that I likely wouldn't get a tenure track teaching position without either a terminal degree (PhD in my case), or a stellar portfolio. It was good advice, and it changed my plans a bit. 

Second, don't set your sights on being an adjunct for too long. The pay stinks and the school is taking advantage of your talents to fill a budgetary gap. Take advantage of that time to connect with other departments or programs, and identify what might make someone with your experience more marketable. When I started I connected with public health, and now the rest of my career will be shaped by a hybrid approach which lends itself to cross-disciplinary research and collaboration. As an example, what would your art look like if it was in collaboration with early childhood development, or mental health, or sociology departments?

I will not discuss further details, and so far I have also not had anyone inquire for more details - you can expect that professors are well aware of the boundaries and keep details confidential. The knowledge that somebody was ill or had other problems is sufficient to do the job on the jury, but might also sufficient to trigger some nice and sympathetic words later - I mean, why not, the fact that you managed to do a good thesis even though you were ill/had children/had bad luck with your data deserves to be praised, even if the details aren't known! We as senior researchers have all gone through phases where life was hard for some reason or another, and we had to still do our work, so we know how difficult it can be.

It’s theoretically possible to do research as a side gig.  I know a guy who works a government job 9-to-5 but spends the rest of his time studying and supposedly doing research on theoretical physics (“supposedly” because he has no training beyond undergrad physics and his work didn’t make a huge amount of sense to me when he explained it).  I’m not saying he’s the model to follow, but if he had done a postdoc in the field, he could be potentially quite productive based on the amount of time and effort he puts into it.  

Have you considered a career as a medical physicist?  They are quite well paid at hospitals and always in demand.  It would require some retraining (~2 yrs) but so would almost anything else.  It can be semi academic job.  Many medical physicists are involved in research and still write papers although not typically as the PI (this might be good thing from a stress level perspective).

In taking a step back, also ask yourself if you would have any regrets switching to a program closer to home. Academia can be extremely stressful and if your passion is disappearing to the extent that you are engaging in self-harm, don't beat yourself up over it. Going back home could very well be the best thing you can do for yourself - remember that what you're going through is part of a much larger learning experience and you have to protect your mental health to get ahead. Leaving home is difficult, and while it can be an extremely valuable experience pushing through it, it's not for everyone, and maybe the time just isn't right.

If after this contemplation you feel that you want to leave not because you are giving up (something you would regret later) but because it's the best decision for you, do it. Life is too short to be miserable.

Whatever you decide, it is always best to keep your options open, so look into taking a leave of absence, or deferring your program for a year.

Even when we got onto other topics, we would gradually drift back to talking about either Our PhDs or The University. Yes, a PhD can be hard, and yes, those can be useful conversations, but that can't be your social life. If you spend a good chunk of your social time talking to other PhD students about how difficult PhDs are and hearing horror stories - many of which will be second or third hand and possibly exaggerated - then that is going to contribute negatively to how you feel about your PhD. It will potentially feel more all-encompassing, more overwhelming, and more difficult than it might otherwise be. 

Conversely, I also kept up an active social life with friends who weren't doing a PhD and had no interest in talking about my PhD or anyone else's beyond the usual chat between friends about how they're getting on in life.

de9bbd2,emailanimal,t2_mkohp,"Meh. Applications are relatively cheap, even for a poor student - or at least the application fee investment is well worth the flexibility you get.

Typical principles are:

1. Quality of the program. Figure out what your floor and ceiling are expected to be. You want one-two safety options (places that will take you no matter what), and one-two stretch options (places where your chances are small).  You want other applications to fall in between so that you had a good chance of being admitted.

2. Geography. You are going to spend five best years of your life (quite possibly, they *were* best years for me) at that place. Make sure you actually like it. If you cannot stand humidity, don't head out to the East Coast.  If you hate driving, go for schools in big cities. If you want to be close to the family, draw a radius around the family hometown. If you want to surf, apply to UCSB. And so on.  Do not underestimate the importance of actually liking the place you are at, and having things to do off-campus during your copious spare time (because mental health depends on it for many people).

3. Program curriculum. I've been at places where getting a Ph.D. is a really straightforward affair: take X courses, find an advisor, defend proposal, write thesis, defend.  I have also been (not as a student though) at places where the Ph.D. curriculum is structured to punish the student: course, two breadth exams and a depth exam, which take semesters to prepare and which require a retake if you did not pass them from the first try, only then proposal and defense.  Run AWAY from places like this. Poorly structured program will add years to your stay without giving you tangible benefits.

4. Faculty. If you want to work with a specific person on a specific topic, apply there. Plain and simple.  Be sure to have a plan B once you are there. In my case I had three people in mind as potential advisors: one of them wound up retiring almost as I came, the other one was an awesome person but would've made a horrible advisor for me, but one of the three became my eventual advisor and I am very happy about it.

You are training to be a professional, and your PI likely trusts (or will teach) that you understand what is needed by X deadline. You will learn how to plan experiments accordingly, and I learned it’s sooo impt to factor in time for things to break/fail/pandemic. 

I just defended my MS mid pandemic and started my PhD a couple of months ago so any thoughts of regular work hours went out the window. When I was getting ready to defend it sucked, straight up. But I made sure to sleep when needed even if that meant 4am-noon bc I was writing until 3am or hadn’t slept for 2 days or something. You do what you need to. I would go in and image at midnight bc no one was around, machines were open, and I didn’t have to risk exposure to people. I was also SUPER burned out so after my defense took time to do ZERO work, sleep in, and hang out with my family ☺️

Also rmr that many people in grad school have families with kids so they also are among those working when needed at times. Some can’t come in until X to drop kid off at school, have to leave by Y to pick them up. Again, you do what you need to. 

Last couple things - I found weekend meal prepping and having things to reheat every week day has saved my mental and physical health. Also, getting a dog saved me even more!! They have to eat and get walked and play and stuff and hey, so do you, so this actively encourages you to take care of both of you. Time for pups breakfast? Cool same. Dogs save lives and are amazing 🥰

TL;DR - work when you need to, not by arbitrary standards set by the business field when you’re in STEM and it’s totally different. Self care. Meal prep. Get a dog ❤️",5,2021-01-16 15:41:55,AskAcademia

dum2j4n,Murderous_squirrel,t2_ywhkn,"Uh, OP, you'll never have anyone sensible recommending taking any kind of meds over the internet. That's just not done. (a) there's more than one kind of anti-depressant on the market and the side-effects, or taking the wrong one is no joke, (b) no one is equipped to evaluate your mental health online and (c) medication should be a last resort scenario, which cannot be resolved by therapy or management. 

If you believe you're in need of anti-depressants, then the best thing I can recommend is to go get an evaluation from a professional who will be better equipped to walk you through the process. 

ALSO, regarding your writer block. 

This: 

&gt;The thing is, I just can't get myself to do any writing exercises. The only time when I'm able to write is if I just have to,

Is your problem. That's just an excuse. Writing is like drawing, math, or playing piano. To get good at it, you need to do it often. If you can only write when you have to, then you'll never get good at it, period. Stop with that ""I can't do it"" attitude and start doing it, even if it's only 5 minutes a day. And if you think that analytic writing do not require creativity, then I got bad news for you... it's evidently different than writing fiction or a novel, but creating sentences and the flow required for a paper is still creative in its own right. 

To be frank, OP, your post seems to be more about finding excuses for your own lack of discipline than any lack of talent or block in and of itself. WITH THAT SAID, I am not you, I do not have your feelings, or your perspective. I know what it is with anxiety and I fully empathize, but it should not lead your life as it seems to be now. If you believe your mental health is inferring with your life enough to cause problems, then my best advise would be to seek a psy or any kind of expert which can councel and advise you on the matter. 

Best of luck. ",5,2018-02-21 19:42:52,AskAcademia
dayobyg,Tianmeihua,t2_hw6t3,"Hello there,

So I am currently in grad school at a canadian university, and registered with Disability Student Services after being diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety. 

At first I didn't want to tell any of my profs what i was going through due to the same fears as you. I was afraid they would have negative reactions, would feel disappointed, would judge me etc. But then i had a meltdown during the office hours of the prof i was TAing for after one of my students tried to commit suicide and was hospitalized. The prof was great. She comforted me, went to get my supervisor and wencame up with a plan so that i could succeed. I did end up having to take medical leave but everyone in my department has been extremely supportive since they know what was going on. They really had no idea that i was struggling and as soon as they learnt they did everything they could to help me. They teamed up with my doctor and counselor and are helping me get a service dog so that i can start functiioning on a day to day basis again. 

Eventually at some point i collapsed when i was giving a guest lecture for a history class. Intense chest pain, everything went black, diziness, numbness in limbs etc. I felt that i was about to faint. It ended up being a bad panic attack. Since the prof knew i was having some issues she was able to catch me and i didnt hurt my head by falling. It really helped that she knew: she called 911, my supervisor (who came to the hospital) and they did all the paperwork while i was there to grant me a medical leave that would not affect my funding whatsoever. Mental health is very serious and most profs take it seriously. With just a doctor's note in Canada you. An register at DSS/Access service or whatever it is called in your university. I didnt take my health seriously and would work a crazy amount of hours each day without taking care of myself. But thanksfully, my profs forced me to take care of me.

I ended up helping my student register at DSS too and last I heard she got extensions and is doing much better as well. I actually sawbher smile and laugh for the first time, which was priceless. 

So the thing is, it is very likely that your profs will be understanding. A lot of people in academia have either dealt with mental issues or are close to someone who does. If your profs know, they can help you better if you develop a more serious health problem all of a sudden. Mental health is important. You are not alone and you are doing all the right things, and my seeking help you may actually end up helping others. Put your health first :) there is help available when you ask for it.

clec2hn,myaltimateform,t2_iy6f7,"Worked for 5 years and went back for my PhD (in neuroscience). Worst decision in my life so far. I'm on the verge of finishing, and with all the endgame bullshit I'm about one more worthless meeting away from just leaving.

It is probably more tolerable to do it right after undergrad, but once you're paid a fair wage for your expertise, earn the respect of some coworkers, and see what life is like on the other side of schooling, going back is soul crushing. Of the 5 over 25 year-olds that entered our program, 1 was kicked out, 2 left in frustration, and myself and another are left. Neither of us is happy. At least 3 started taking antidepressants during enrollment. I would say the overall incidence of depression is ~50% in the program.

During my first few years, I actively recruited people to the program during interview weekends. Now, I honestly feel that pursuing a PhD is bad idea for *anybody*. Academic science is awesome in theory. In practice, its mired in high school level politics, egos of a magnitude man may never be able to measure, and a faux antiquity that from far away appears charming, but up close is grotesque and self defeating. Almost every person I know that has completed their degree has had to go through a 'decontamination' process before they felt human again. Why? Because for 5 years, your job is to shit on everything. Your lab mates' work, the papers you read, the talks you attend, your own work, everything. And it gets to you. It has to. 

Our school had enough problems that there is a support group for current graduate students. It is one of the few times I've heard of a support group existing for something you willingly walk back into at the end of the meeting. And this is a top tier university.

Maybe it's me. Maybe it's this school. Maybe it's this program. But, do yourself a favor and research the incidence of mental health programs in graduate schools. Seek out articles on the cons. You'll find plenty on the practical issues related to pay and employment options coming out. Then look for feedback from junior researchers - those looking for tenure track positions or the 2nd postdoc. Then come to terms with the fact that whatever groundbreaking research you *think* you might be headed for, you *will* settle for something significantly less interesting and less far-reaching than your worst case scenario because you will simply want out.

I fucking love science. I fucking hate academia with a passion. 

(Reading over your post again, I thought I should note that I had 3 years of lab experience in my exact field/subfield. My grades were good but not great in undergrad and I majored in neuroscience. I went in fully aware of the sacrifices I would have to make in a practical sense, but I was still floored by what I experienced.)",5,2014-10-20 03:57:56,AskAcademia
dbffsye,riggorous,t2_asvfd,"&gt; it's better if I just don't care.

I think you will have considerably better mileage with this proposition anywhere but academia, tbh. Graduate school isn't like undergrad. It's not writing a 15 page paper the night before it's due, getting a pat on the back from your professor, an A in the course, and watching netflix the rest of the time. You're a student in name only (in fact you're an underpaid, totally expendable junior faculty member), so you are expected to look nice and act professional and have lots of responsibilities. Also, as in any highly competitive field, your professional network will have immense impact on the progress of your career, I'd say more than your academic record. When it comes to hiring, it is imperative that you make people like you. 

Some undergrads romanticize the academic profession because they see maybe 10% of what their favorite professor does every day. It's almost entirely not about wearing comfy sweaters and talking about books. Professorship is a job. It involves office politics and responsibilities.

I'm not a mental health expert, and certainly I know people with both depression and anxiety who are successful in academia, but if social interaction and having responsibilities stress you out, academia (or teaching broadly, perhaps?) isn't the field for you. It's a job heavy on both of those things. On the other hand, a generic office gig is by comparison pretty chill. You go home at a set hour, you don't have to talk to anyone unless you're in a client-facing position, and your responsibilities are commensurate with your pay (which, if you're getting paid how much junior TT faculty in the humanities get paid, won't be much). 

This is why people frequently recommend that you get some real life experience before going to grad school. Most people don't know what academia is like, or what working is like, when they graduate college.",5,2016-12-20 16:59:38,AskAcademia

fphypoo,synthesis-synthesis,t2_3ev125pt,"Professor here. First, congratulations ! I'm glad that you have clarity about whether or not to pursue an academic career. To answer some of your questions:

""Should I feel guilty for not wanting to pursue these?"" **No.**

""Can I tell them (my past advisor) that I do not want to pursue them?"" **Only if you want to.** Since you already explained you don't want to go on the academic job market, they shouldn't be surprised.

""Can I request they stop asking me to work on this?"" **Yes.** It's somewhat surprising they've been hounding you if you already communicated your desire to leave academia.

Your advisor isn't the only person from your university who can provide a reference letter. I assume you had a larger dissertation **committee**. I also assume you took **coursework with other professors**. Make sure to keep those relationships in good shape, at least for the next year or two. As soon as you get a job, you'll start developing a new roster of people who can vouch for you.

You provided further context to Quant\_Liz\_Lemon when you wrote ""I think they’re adamant about getting the papers published because they are a co-author."" **This is not your problem.** This is especially true because they are **1)** *tenured*, **2)** in a different research area, and **3)** did not fund you (beyond a 60 day period).

Even if they funded you for a significant period of time, that doesn't obligate you to expand their research profile. *Your mental health and your boundaries are more important than their ego.* It's also very possible they think the work is valuable and their reasons are mostly altruistic--that still doesn't obligate you.

I'll also give them the benefit of the doubt since you haven't explicitly told them you're not going to publish.

When you write , express gratitude for their guidance over the years. Then tell them you're not going to pursue publication. Thank them again for their time and wish them well. **Don't JADE:** justify, argue, defend, or explain. That makes it seem like you're doing something you don't have the right to do or like you require their approval. **This is your intellectual labor, and you're no longer a student.**

Don't mention future job references in this particular email. No need to link that with the frustration they may (or may not) feel about your boundary setting. They may or may not respond. Just reach out in however many weeks or months to secure a reference. If you have any suspicion at all that this person would undermine you, then seek references from other faculty and staff.

g56hmlo,torgoboi,t2_1xpanblf,"Like other users have said, this sounds like a mix of depression and not knowing how skills from your degree will translate. I'd like to address the mental health component.

You talk about your traits, skills and temperament as if they're this static thing beyond your control. I think it's understandable to feel that way if you're very set on a single idealized version of your future, or if people have constantly told you that you're suited to be this *one thing*, but that mindset can be very self-defeating and isn't objectively true. Many people go into their degrees and their jobs with no idea what they're doing; only with time and practice (and often, a great deal of messing up) do they get to be good at something. People may naturally excel at some things more than others, and their temperaments and interest sets may make some things easier for them, but by no means are they an absolute determiner for success.

You mentioned you have 1-2 years of school left. This is time you can use to get into a better headspace and evaluate what you need to do for what's ahead. If it's going straight to a job, you can find stuff that you're strong with and start from there. That process of improvement doesn't stop with graduation; plenty of my friends taught themselves new things and took on unfamiliar stuff during their first few years on the workforce and it bumped them to better jobs down the road! If it's grad school, learning self-assurance would be very valuable; you will need to have some faith in your skills and your ideas to push through those rougher points in your research.

If you want to see if you're interested in something like research or academia, I'd say it would be worth talking to your advisor for a realistic sense of what that looks like. I would also recommend maybe trying to get a larger independent project (independent study, a thesis) or a research job. So much of the research process, separate from the other things mentioned, can be tedious and mind-numbing, rather than that idealized vision of long hours at your desk writing profound new things.

d1v70yq,HM_D,t2_find4,"Short answer: Agree with psiklops. Basically the job is very flexible and people care about results. Most coworkers will treat your mental illness the same way they treat other important non-work 'distractions,' like cancer or divorce or kids or car accidents: sympathy and a willingness to let things slide in the short term, but no real long-term change in standards or expectations &amp; certainly no relaxation of deadlines. 

Most university jobs come with access to health services, and most universities have a disabilities services office, at least in 'the west.' 

Longer answer: As you move up the ladder, you will basically need to satisfy three groups: the admins at your home university, reviewers of grants/papers/tenure, and your research colleagues. 

The first group makes sure that you're teaching your classes, organizing the things you need to be organizing, etc. In my experience, they're willing to make lots of accommodations if you are sick. At some point,  e.g. if you are totally unavailable for weeks at a time, you would have to go on sick leave - but this point is MUCH later than it tends to be in industry. However, this is also generally the least important group.

The second group is generally anonymous and doesn't care at all about personal factors.

The third group you get to choose. Most people are pretty sympathetic, and you can normally set up your research so that everything is fine if you sometimes can't work. Some people are assholes and won't be accommodating; if you're paying attention, you'll figure this out pretty quickly (I didn't pay attention to this until I was a postdoc, to my detriment). 

Suggestions: try to find out, through the gossip mill, who has a reputation for being a good mentor on these issues &amp; then try to buy them a coffee.

Setting boundaries and pushing back against being assigned duties that you can't handle (needing to stay sane makes it ""can't"" not ""won't"", imo) is a healthy action. Now, your PI may feel let down, but you seem to be switching fields anyway, so she can deal with some disappointment. And probably should, it's good that someone pushes back. I do think that it strikes me as odd that you are so committed to your 40 hour week. Sometimes I have slow weeks where I probably don't work 40, other weeks when deadlines are pressing, I work much more. I have a work-life balance, I take time off for vacation or mental health days, but I also know that sometimes I'm going to need to be 24/7 on a project. I think being committed to your work-life balance doesn't have to mean being committed to 9-5 and not a moment more. The project you're managing and the people on that team may view you as not a team player or a crappy leader if you have to go home at what seems like an arbitrary time to grad students. I think my PI encourages us to have a work-life balance, but I think the nature of our lab work is that sometimes you have to work 12 hour days. And the nature of writing, I have found, is coordinating edits at 1130 pm for a midnight submission. I would have tried to avoid a 24/7 push push push lab group if I were you, but welp, that ship sailed.

I don't think they exist in academia, which I feel like you should have had some concept of coming into being an RA in the type of lab you chose. I'm kinda hung up on the fact that you've been in this lab for half a year and haven't had problems and yet you're now worried that you will be a slave to the job. Maybe you're already doing fine setting your behavior? Who expressed these weekend and night obligations, and did they give you a sense of like how often or how long those demands will persist? How did you respond when those expectations were laid out?

Some of us have much to offer this world, but if I have a seizure (or some highly stigmatized mental health episode) during a high workload week, then it doesn't matter. I cannot share capabilities with the world. Just because my brain does not work on someone else's schedule.

Many people cannot grasp the concept of ""twice-exceptionality."" Either you're ""smart and capable"" or ""dumb and incompetent."" I once told a redditor that I had a professor (PhD in Math) who had a learning disability and the redditor accused me of lying, because ""people with learning disabilities can't graduate college.""

People are more complex than that. Most people just want to demonstrate their true capabilities, and for many, all it takes to do so is some flexibility or some extra time on a test.

I certainly do not condone reduced rigor of classes. But increased flexibility for individuals who are facing personal challenges? That's not reduced rigor-- that's allowing people to take time to tend to their very real health needs. The assignment will still be there when they get back (I assume you're not getting rid of assignments in their entirety-- just allowing them to be done on a time-table that is more convenient to students).

Reducing rigor would imply that you are decreasing standards for what constitutes ""A"" level work. The disability laws specifically state that this is something that you do not need to do, and if it something you are being pushed to do, I would give a nice nudge back in their direction (I understand the political pressures, but if you are genuinely being asked to lower standards, then that is a problem).

Remember, the laws that dictate you must be given accommodations in school are laws that apply in the ""real world"" too. A person cannot be fired for a disability unless it actually affects job performance. A person must be given reasonable accommodations.

More and more people are able to go to school and fulfill their true potential as a result of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I see this as nothing but a good thing.

Again, if you are actually reducing rigor, this is something you should push back on (if you can without getting yourself into too much hot water). But extending flexibility to those who need it is most certainly a positive development. Students have a right to be imperfect humans (hopefully they'll realize this someday, too).",4,2019-04-29 15:11:11,AskAcademia

eon16bf,i_sideswipe,t2_8j08y,"I wouldn't have done it. I took a medical withdrawal from mine back in 2015 due to rapidly increasing depression and anxiety. I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2016, and I'm currently going through the diagnosis process for autism as well. It's now 4 years since I withdrew from the PhD and my mental health is still affected in significant ways.

It's not all bad though. Through counselling and introspection I discovered that I'd started the PhD for the wrong reason. I went into it not because I wanted it, but because I felt like it was expected of me. Through the diagnoses I've learned more about myself than I ever thought possible, and I'm more understanding and forgiving of my limitations than before.

These days, when I'm not working on my mental health, I'm trying to figure out how to become an indie game developer. Unlike the PhD, becoming a game developer is something I've wanted to do for a very long time, ever since I was about 4 years old or so. Given I was born in Northern Ireland in the late 80s, and grew up in the 90s, I was discouraged from that by family and teachers. But it is something I've wanted to do my whole life, so I'm trying to figure out how to do it. 

None of this answers your direct questions though. So here we go.

&gt; What were some things that you would have dedicated more time to?

Life. When I was working on my PhD, and especially on my thesis I didn't so much have a work/life balance as a work/sleep balance. While I had some great experiences presenting at conferences and getting published, plenty more passed me by. My PhD was pretty standard for the UK; 3 years research with 1 optional thesis write-up year. So this advice may not apply completely to you if your country structures the PhD different, but don't let life pass you by.

&gt; Would you have focused more on your research/increased your productivity?

I think my productivity when it came to research was on the whole pretty good. If I had to do it again, I would ask for more support, structure, and accountability from my supervisors, primarily to help me navigate the PhD while compensating for the areas that ADHD make me weak in. 

&gt; Or would you have allocated more time to things such as leadership experience, education, side-projects? Any cool ideas that would be fun to try?

Being involved with teaching for me was probably the most fun and rewarding experience I had while doing the PhD. As I had to repeat part of my final undergrad year due to missing two key exams because of migraines, I was able to get an early start on this. By the time I was properly settled onto the PhD; about 4/5 months after I started, I was able to request to be a TA for a new undergraduate module that was starting that semester. I very quickly became friends with the lecturer, and together we developed the module's content and in the second year of the course also the delivery mechanism. Though this I was then able to get experience with marking and assessing undergrad projects and exams, exam invigilation/proctoring, and mentorship for final year undergrads working on their dissertation projects.",4,2019-05-24 12:34:12,AskAcademia

g1pbe9h,astro-temp,t2_16xoe9cy,"No, none of this has to be true.

It's a very common problem for PhDs that we get too involved in things, too personally invested, too worked-up about academia issues. We don't have to be siloed. It's partly the fault of bad supervisors, but it also happens to the overly neurotic students of *good* supervisors. If you're passionate about a topic and really care about a career, then it's natural that you'd have this kind of tendency to get too involved in your own work and to be consumed by it. You have to do the work to control yourself and hold yourself back.

You need more perspective, basically.

Right now you don't have the mental or physical space for other perspectives beyond the pinhole you're looking through, so you'll need to chat to a counsellor or other mental health professional first. It's a good idea to go for a checkup with your doctor too, just to make sure there's nothing glaringly wrong and easy to fix like a vitamin D deficiency. Simple things like that can seriously affect mental health, but do it in vague ways that are *identical* to the symptoms of stress/anxiety/depression/etc so are easily missed. It can really mess up your treatment though.

You go to the counsellor (or psychologist/psychiatrist/whatever suits) and you start talking about how you feel, how long you've felt that way, and what kind of improvements you'd like to see in life. They might suggest talking therapy, medication, or both. You might go to group sessions for people with work-based anxiety. You might have to keep a mood diary for a while. These things do take time, often weeks, and they take effort on your part. For medication specifically, you need to give it time to build up in your system, and if it's not the right one for you then you need more time to withdraw and build up on the next med. And maybe you don't like the first counsellor, or you just don't mesh well, so you need to spend time looking for someone you feel respects you.

Then, once your mental health is a bit more stable (or concurrently), look at getting a life outside of academia. A whole life: accommodation, friends, hobbies, favourite locations, weekend activities. That means having days off. If you're worried about supervisor expectations then it's time to *communicate* and tell them that you're changing your work habits and will no longer be contactable on weekends.",4,2020-08-16 03:37:22,AskAcademia

We got into different programs at the same school, but while she was eager before, now the only thing she says keeps her going is the idea of going back home. She says she's been lying to herself and is terrible at school (she always does better than me). She says constantly feels like the dumb one in class (all her classmates have said they're jealous of her work). The rest of her cohort all knew each other in undergrad, so she feels like an isolated outsider here. She can't bring herself to care about her work because with all the stress, she just feels like it's a giant waste of time. But she also says she'd never forgive herself if she dropped out. And I don't mean all this in a ""haha I'm the worst~ nevermind my perfect scores i'm terrible"" way, but a ""sobbing on the bathroom floor every night for a week, self harm risk"" kind of way.

First of all, get rid of the idea that there's any shame in dropping out of grad school. Grad school is a job, and jobs don't work out all the time. And grad school is definitely not a one-size-fits-all kind of job. Three of my closest friends dropped out of undergrad, and they're all incredibly happy and comfortable with what they're doing now, and that's the important part. Grad school's riddled with accessibility barriers that are never worth sacrificing your health to get over. My partner's case is a little unique, since we're overseas and dropping out would force her back home, but if that weren't the case, I'd recommend her drop out for the sake of her health. But it's not because you're not smart enough, I guarantee you, and your work ethic is something for you to decide, not compare to other people. For me, I work best when I don't pay attention to how other people are doing. You don't need that stress.

Since dripping out's not an option for my partner, what we do is focus on giving it her all, as much as her mental health can take. Don't get caught up in anxiety about the big picture--set short term goals and hit them one at a time. Find a pattern. Get outside and into the sun. Make friends. If you come out of your program without the highest marks, so what? It's a glove that doesn't fit perfectly. Not your fault, you did what you could, which I guarantee you is better than you're thinking. Nothing is more important than your health and happiness. It's easy to think school is the end-all-be-all of life, but saying that not doing well in grad school means you're a failure of a person is like saying not getting into a ritzy party in Manhattan means you're a social outcast.

She felt she needed to sabotage most PhD students, and in general, men. (She had a chip on her shoulder about how hard it is for women in science. The irony was that originally she was a Master's student for my PI, they became lovers, the guy divorced his wife, and married the lady in question... so her hard work happened mostly outside the laboratory. Anyhow.) So she sabotaged us. One student for example was essentially funded by another prof: all his reagents were purchased by a postdoc in the other guy's lab, as our dear lab manager did not order you stuff, unless you have shown success. But without stuff you can't really show success, can you; not to mention as a PhD student you are being trained -in theory- how to be a successful researcher, so a couple of hiccups are kind of expected.

 There were three postdocs who took up similar horrible attitudes- as they themselves were suffering. Grownup women behaving like the cast of Mean Girls; you can imagine how great it was to go in every morning to work. Needless to say there were nobody graduating from the lab for seven years; everyone either left, or just got stuck. It was an incredibly toxic place.


After sticking out three years in that lab, I just gave up and left. The best choice I've ever made. Should have done earlier. I was depressed, suicidal and utterly without hope. Once I left I finally felt this weight I was not even aware of lifting off my chest.

At some (and more every day) universities, they have skilled staff ready to deal with these kinds of issues. It has helped in both cases. One thing I've found in the cases I've referred is that they're scared that the uni will contact their parents because that's happened previously (when they were minors). 2&gt;I definitely Academic activities were useless to this person because their cognitive skills weren't functioning.

At my institution, we frequently will grant requests for leave if students are suffering mental illness with diminished capacity.

I think it really depends how high your interest in research is... personally, I think you should really be very, very sure that the area you want to continue research in is something that you find super cool and something that you are naturally intrigued by. Whilst the initial proposal for a PhD project will probably be determined mostly by a supervisor, you have the opportunity to carve out what you want to discover and what you want to research -- I imagine this will be less true if applying for jobs in a similar area.

I graduated from a physics MSci from Imperial in 2017 and also suffered from mental health issues throughout (I had to take a year out), but I have to say that whilst PhD is stressful (I stayed at Imperial), there is a much stronger support group of supervisors, postdocs, fellow PhD students who all know what it is like and who are all really supportive. Personally, I've found the relaxed nature of a PhD (being able to work which hours I want to, being able to take a day off if I'm feeling particularly down, being able to work all day if i'm feeling manic!) has been relatively beneficial for my mental health.

Obviously, sometimes I think about how much I could be earning doing banking or being a consultant or something in the City, but at the end of the day I really love my PhD project and I'm really invested in it. I earn enough to live comfortably so for me, it's not that big of a deal.

This is what I'd personally say to a professor. It sounds serious, sincere, and humble. You want your professor to know that *you know* that you're relying on their mercy, and that you're willing to do what it takes to pass their class. You do not want to sound like you expect to get 100s on late assignments. When you meet with him/her in person (which you should definitely do, it reinforces how serious you are, and it will demonstrate how dedicated you are), reinforce that you are ready to work with them to resolve this problem.

I had a problem in college, and when I went into my professor's office to talk to him (after sending an email with a similar tone as above), he told me he just wanted to make sure that I was okay, and that he'd waive my 2 absences. Professors are humans, too, and I'll bet you aren't the first student who has gone through this problem. Just make sure that your prof can see how genuine you are. Don't be surprised if he/she emails you later in the semester/pulls you aside to see how you're doing. Most of them do care!

I had a friend whose parent died during school, and I helped him write a similar email to his professors when he missed their finals to go to his mom's funeral. They can help, as long as you ask. If you never ask, they don't know.

I would also set up an appointment with the school's counselors. That way, when/if your professor asks about how you're doing/steps you've taken, you can share that with him/her. Plus, it'll help you!",4,2018-11-06 18:56:29,AskAcademia
d8yhxai,woxihuan,,"Make it theory heavy. For example, choose a small, non-emotional personal *behaviour* - not emotion, but an action you do - and write about that action with a theoretical lens. For example, if you are a man who fosters kittens, address how gendered codes are visible, how this one applied generally to men, do some research on statistics on perceived nurturing qualities in men versus women and connect it to some bigger issue in society, like men getting custody. Do that for a few behaviors.

I do not think it's necessarily good to be emotionally invested in your academic research. It can be a barrier for a lot of students, for a lot of reasons, and classes structured around personal experiences *massively* privilege students with good mental health, ""normal"" or ""ideal"" backgrounds, and students who are financially privileged and have more self esteem because of that privilege. It's a pedagogical quirk that teaches to the ideally positioned student rather than the real student who ends up in the class. Obviously, there are also arguments for this kind of teaching, but it's also quite frankly just trendy right now to have a student-centered and emotional-narrative driven classroom activity. 

I find the activities a huge barrier to comfort, and therefore learning, in the classroom, especially if they're public. Private written assignments aren't as bad, but it's so problematic to be assessed on the quality - the subjective quality - of your ability to write an emotional narrative for a grade. 

I have done many of these classes. I've gone to experimental colleges and had teachers in standard university programs, both undergrad and MA level, and the classes have always been a struggle for me emotionally and my grades suffer. I've looked into these practices as part of a teaching and pedagogical year-long course I've taken as well as from the position of an educator, and I think that while some students benefit, others are harmed, and these coursework assignments need to be flexible.

Hopefully your advisor is supportive in general. I know some students who feel comfortable crying in front of their advisors (including other students in my lab), but it makes me uncomfortable. When I feel overwhelmed or spread too thin or am on the brink of tears already, I'll email my advisor and say that I'm having a rough day and would like to meet later in the day or the week when my head's on straight.",4,2021-02-23 01:51:13,AskAcademia
crg86v5,phdbynight,t2_nln60,"Take at least a year off.  My partner was in the same situation as you, and pushed through to do a MSc right away at one of the universities mentioned, and has been dealing with the repercussions for three years now.  

Take time off, get the help you need, and then go back to studying if you still want to.

I know several people who are doing or have completed PhDs with a history of depression/anxiety, and who are able to manage their stress levels and maintain high standards of work, but all of them took time off to prioritise their mental health before moving from Undergrad to PhD/Masters level.  

Properly working through these issues should be your number one priority right now - once you are feeling like you are in a more stable mental situation, and able to deal with high levels of stress, you can always go back and do a Masters.  You may even discover that your area of interest shifts after a year or two of working and thinking, which can be a positive thing for your career in the long run.

There is no reason why someone with a history of depression can't do a good Masters degree (my partner got a distinction, while in the throes of a nervous breakdown because of the stress) but there is also no reason to put yourself through this incredibly difficult 'trial by fire' when you have an alternative.  

Trust me, if you found doing an undergrad was stressful, you will be shocked by how much worse a Masters and PhD are.  Prepare yourself by taking care of yourself fully before jumping in!!",4,2015-05-21 11:25:21,AskAcademia
gepmln2,Galactica13x,t2_2dfbs3uu,"Agree with this very much. If you're actively receiving care and working on a plan to deal with these moments of ""extreme inattentiveness"" then I think you can let your professor know that you're dealing with some medical issues that you are working to resolve, and you appreciate some flexibility/understanding. But you also need to think about whether or not you're in a place to devote the time and attention to graduate school, which can itself be a difficult mental health experience. And it's totally fine if you decide you're not ready! Better to decide that and take time to take care of yourself than to try to power through and end up burning bridges because you're not able to be as present as you need to be to do the work.

The difference here is that the potential PIs get 6 weeks of me doing a rotation in their lab before they make a decision. I was wondering if the scars would be enough to be likely to sway that decision, compared to the 6 weeks of work. I know that, all else being equal, almost anyone would pick the student without the scars. I just wasn't sure how much it was likely to affect a decision.

As for addressing them, most people usually know what they are. There's not much to address. I might try to gauge from current lab members how understanding a PI is about mental health issues if I'm considering that lab. If a PI brings it up, I'll answer any questions and address their concerns (within reason), but I worry that bringing it up would make it seem like I'm trying to force my PI to care about my personal life, if that makes sense.

e0ohb2u,bbbright,t2_dpmx4,"Are you having trouble paying attention to other things you try to work on, or is it just papers? You mention being stressed by the conditions you’re dealing with during school (which is super normal). You might consider getting screened for ADHD or depression/anxiety. Before I was medicated for depression I had a ton of trouble focusing long enough on anything to get stuff done, and I still have similar problems whenever I have flare ups. If you think something else medical could be going on that is affecting your ability to focus getting a physical isn’t a bad idea either. I’m not necessarily saying this is the case with you, but it could be good to rule out. 

Practically, with paper reading, what’s worked for me has been not killing myself trying to read every single word of the paper. Unless it’s super, super important/relevant to my research, I read the intro and results. I will usually look over the figures as I am reading the results and make sure the data supports the claims the paper is making. I skip the discussion and methods unless there’s a particular method I’m interested in or I’m unfamiliar with a lot of the techniques used. Sometimes then I’ll even just Google a technique I’m unfamiliar with because figuring out what a technique actually tests isn’t always super easy from what’s written in the methods. 

I take a decent amount of notes while I’m reading (either on the paper itself if it’s a hard copy or as digital annotations in Mendeley if I’m reading it on my computer). I have trouble paying attention in lectures if I’m just listening and not writing things down, and I think I do better with papers if it’s a similarly active process. YMMV on this one but it’s also nice to be able to glance back at a paper and have the stuff I’m interested in highlighted or have the important results summarized in the margin. 

I also have found that as I’ve gotten deeper into my work, there’s a HUGE temptation to try to read Every Paper In Existence on whatever topic (because I feel like that’s what I have to do for my knowledge to be “complete”). Obviously you want to be as familiar as possible with the literature, but you should also be judicious about how much you throw in the “to read” pile, because at a certain point it becomes overwhelming to me and I just end up not doing any of the reading. I’ve gotten a lot better at scanning abstracts more judiciously and not downloading every single paper I see. Basically just avoid doing unnecessary work if reading is super time consuming for you. 

Tl;dr version: get your physical/mental health checked out to make sure everything’s ok there, think about what parts of the paper are actually helpful for you and try to just read those, try taking notes as you read, and don’t waste time on papers that you don’t 1000% need to read.

dukof2s,mnchemist,t2_46bnvbu,"I would agree with the previous poster that said it entirely depends on the cause of your depression. 

I don’t know that I’d call myself depressed during grad school but, I was pretty miserable and I did have a lot of anxiety. I literally had a panic attack during a seminar presentation in front of everybody (professors included) in my department during grad school. Afterward, I ended up sitting in my car in the parking and just cried for I don’t how long. That was probably my lowest point during grad school. 

After grad school, I accepted a post doc position in a new lab, in a new state, far from everyone I knew. I was even more miserable than I had been during grad school and I can confidently say I was actually depressed during that time. I stayed in that lab for almost two years before moving on to another post doc position. When I took the new position, I moved in with my fiancé (now husband) and most of the reasons that caused my depression (terrible project, less than ideal work environment, long commute to campus, constant worry over money, overall loneliness) went away. I’m so much happier now. I love my current lab. I feel more productive and more engaged on all my projects. My overall anxiety levels have gone down despite having to do far more oral presentations than I ever had to do before. 

It does get better but you honestly have to figure out what’s causing your depression and find a way to change those things that are making you unhappy.

dk6qthv,tah_infity_n_beyarnd,,"Ehh..that's a very subjective question, one which I'm not sure I can provide an adequate response to. I'll begin with a short story.  

Most of my (tiny) cohort were older, nontraditional students. The two students who ""dropped out"" were both pretty traditional students in some respect. The first person was very young, 20 years old, just graduated with an MA and had no real world experience, and had never even held a real job, let alone ever had their first drink (so they said). This person didn't even finish their first week, because ""Everybody was always talking about what they wanted to research and had ideas, and I had no idea what I wanted to do. I just knew I liked [our discipline]."" So, not a good reason to go to grad school, IMO, but I don't think it's a good reason to acquiesce to defeat either; this person surely could have given it a shot and left by a different means.  

So, to answer your question, if you don't know what you want to research by the time you apply for grad school, I would do some SERIOUS thinking. I wouldn't recommend it, but if you're committed, at least ask yourself these questions:

1. WHY do you even want to go to grad school? What is your end goal? Your end goals in academia can be various, and have different requirements. For example, if you want to research at a top-tier institution like Harvard, you are going to need to go publish your butt off and get a PhD and publish some books. But, if you want to teach instead of research, having an Master's allows you to teach at (some) community colleges (but this is changing). A Ph.D., however, is requisite at most research institutions, in order to teach undergraduates and/or graduate students. Even as a tenure-track professor, you are not guaranteed to teach grad classes (I might have this wrong...).  
2. Have you talked to other grad students, in real life, just about their daily experiences? We are helpful here at /r/AskAcademia, but you might want to browse /r/GradSchool specifically, and maybe take a gander at occupational related publications about academia over at /r/HigherEducation.  
3. Are you in a committed relationship or married? Will your partner be willing to suck it up with you for 2-8 years, and move probably across the country with you?  
4. What is your fall back plan? A lot of people fail out or drop out of graduate school, period. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It's hard, it's sometimes brutal, but everyone has a different experience.  
5. How willing are YOU to stick to a goal for 2-4 years, or more if you decide to pursue a Ph.D. beyond a Master's?  
6. Do you mind being poor? Constantly broke? Taking out student loans?  
7. Do you have kids? 
8. Do you intend to go to school for a Master's or Ph.D.? Part-time or full-time? Do you plan to have a ""real job"" while going to grad school? 
9. Did you do well in undergraduate courses? 
10. What makes YOU special? How will you market/sell yourself to admissions committees? 
11. What DRIVES you? What is the reason you wake up in the morning? 
12. DO YOU HAVE A SUPPORT SYSTEM? Also, how well are you with managing your schedule, mental health, and physical wellness? (I have ""real"" anxiety, formally diagnosed by health professionals [contest it sure but this isn't the time or place], *and it's not like grad school ever made life any **easier**!* Real talk, but people don't often want to say/hear this).

Think long and hard, talk to people. Browse the other forums. Talk to your professors. Talk to grad students at the institution where you go to school/went to school.

dpt9xoc,DarkwingDoctor,,"I can second the advice from u/anjkris.  Doing a PhD is an exercise in persistence and willpower as much as anything.  A PhD is not something that you do because you need a place to go.  If your heart is not in the work, then your work will suffer.  Then your emotional health will suffer because the work is suffering, which will make the work harder, and so on.  It can end up being a cycle of negativity that you don't want.

If you're really wanting to look into a doctorate, then your plan should start about a couple of years before you expect to be admitted.  That way, you have the time to work on your resume, start some publications, research what doctoral program is right for you, and maximize your mental health before you start the journey.  The couple of years in advance of coursework also allows you time for other opportunities to materialize themselves that may result in you not pursuing a doctorate.  If you're doing good work, you may find more opportunity waiting for you.  

Seriously, though, a doctorate is very tough on a person mentally.  It can make you doubt yourself, your abilities, and who you are as a person.  If your mind isn't right going into a doctoral program, don't go in.  I've never met anyone who got happier by going through the process.  ",4,2017-11-14 17:20:41,AskAcademia
frsn8m1,thoughtcity,t2_h9yet,"I will add onto this comment: the experience is also very overwhelming, almost all of the time. There always seems like there is more that you can be doing. Even when I feel like I may busting my ass, I may still feel like I'm not doing enough. Whereas with a set of classes, the goal is a lot more clear and success is more tangible: to get good grades and to learn so that you can potentially apply the knowledge. But as a PhD student, those milestones are less concrete and sometimes feel like they are always out of reach. I have found that even if my experiments are working, and I'm spending a lot of time in the lab, there is a plethora of literature that I'd like to go through, which is only ever a growing list. And reading literature gives rise to ideas that I'd like to try in the lab. Then there are seminars that I may not have time for, or opportunities to network that I may not have the energy to attend.

The constant criticism is also difficult to handle, especially when mental health is at a low. I have found few things more soul-crushing than pulling long hours to prepare something in spite of being at the edge of a mental breakdown, only to have the project ripped to pieces and scrapped because there isn't the right kind of information available for us to use it.

eqdzfac,foibleShmoible,t2_i61ju,"I want to start off by saying that I am sorry that you've had all of this happening. I want to be very clear that I do sympathise with your situation, because I'm afraid that what I have to say is going to come across as harsh. To be clear, I don't think that you did anything wrong in how you attempted to handle the situation from your side, **but** I don't *necessarily* think your university did anything wrong either. So I'm going to try and show why from the university's perspective a grade bump isn't necessarily due.

&gt; I applied to have counselling at the university which was 6 sessions starting at the end of September 2018. **These 6 sessions didn’t have a major impact on my situation but they definitely helped.**

(Emphasis my own) This statement shows first off that the university has been supporting you this year. However the second sentence negates somewhat the point you tried to make about your lower second semester grades (""11.67% less than the previous semester where I received counselling and support."") You can't argue that counselling didn't have a major impact and then claim that without it you had a major drop in marks.

&gt; I arranged a meeting with the welfare officer again and told her my mental health is deteriorating... The welfare officer emailed the counselling service at the uni and asked for me to have urgent sessions because of my situation. I was offered a group mental health workshop a month~ later, which I could not attend 

Now you had a very good reason not to be able to attend, but that isn't the university/welfare officer/counselling services fault; you asked for support and they did make it available to you.

&gt; I contacted the welfare officer again saying I’m seriously struggling ... and that I had not heard back about counselling sessions but just received a generic response of maybe deferring or extending my modules for this semester. I asked whether my circumstances could be taken into consideration when marking my assignments and she said the university doesn’t do that. So I go and get extensions on my modules for this semester. This wasn’t a good idea, without much support it was just extra time for me to struggle with.

&gt; In May I was called by the counselling service and was offered sessions, 3 months after requesting them and that’s 3 months of not much support from the university other than maybe extend or defer, dealing with my family issues and my own mental health - lonely times. I had moved back home shortly before this as I was not receiving support and thought being home would help, so I couldn’t accept the sessions but also this was after lectures had ended and it was just deadlines.

You had previously had extensions and you accepted them this time, and that is a pretty standard form of support for students with extenuating circumstances like yours. It is unfortunate that the offered sessions came 3 months down the line, but again you had been offered a group session (that you had, I acknowledge, been unable to attend) and since the sessions were offered before your extended deadlines there was arguably time for them to help you prior to submitting your final assignments. Again, it is not the university or counselling service's fault that you had already moved home.

&gt; After seeing this I checked the university policy and it states that if a student has circumstances which affect their academic performance, it could be requested to be considered during marking of assignments, with **potentially a different marking system in place**. Whereas the welfare officer said the university doesn’t do this.
It states that appeals can be made if academic performance has been affected by circumstances of the student that are unknown to the marker and results are lower than expected.

(Emphasis my own) Your welfare officer might have been incorrect previously, or they might have known that *in your particular circumstances* a different marking system would not have been used. IMO/IME, one might expect extensions *or* marking adjustments in your circumstances, but not really both, and you'd already had the former.

I also have to agree with u/another_secret_prof on this point:
&gt; nobody knows what you would have achieved without these problems.

First off, it is entirely possible that your final semester courses were harder than the ones previously. Secondly, a person's grades can fluctuate at any time. (During my own degree I had a 30% fluctuation between my highest and lowest marks.) Especially since your *mean* for second semester was 53, implying that on some assignments you did better than that, surely?

---------------------------------------------------------

To conclude (because that was a wall of text), I do believe that the university took reasonable steps to accommodate you. Were the accommodations perfect? Probably not. But that is not for a lack of trying. There is no way to know exactly what will work for every person, but they offered you both extensions and counselling support (which you were not always able to take up, for legitimate reasons, but that is not their fault), and you have no way to *prove* that you would have scored higher under different circumstances.

By all means, appeal if you want, you have nothing to lose. But I honestly think they took reasonable steps to accommodate you in very difficult circumstances. Best of luck, and I hope that things improve for you moving forwards.",4,2019-06-08 12:33:31,AskAcademia

dwvx7fi,NoxiousQuadrumvirate,t2_kywisro,"Well sure, I can tell you my story, but most of what I did was intimately tied to the life I live, who I know, what resources are available.

I was ill my entire life. I had a psychotic break at 16, attempted suicide, was sectioned, practically dropped out of school, lived on the streets, and got addicted to heroin whilst dating a skinhead. 

I got a scholarship to attend university for physics, chemistry, and maths, and I moved 300km away. I tried to get through without any assistance but figured out that was pretty damn stupid after I failed all of my midterms. I got disability accomodations, and managed to salvage my grades. Next semester, I mentioned to a psychiatrist that I was struggling, and he sectioned me. If I refused medication or made any complaints, he'd threaten to have me admitted. Rather than feel like I was at the mercy of his decisions, I stopped all treatment. 

I used ""performance enhancing drugs"", but not anything to do with ADHD, and nothing technically illegal. I also drank coffee, the most widely used cognitive enhancing drug. Those drugs don't make you smarter. They don't make you better at learning. If you don't put the hours in to study yourself, no drug will magically make you know and understand everything. This is real life, not Limitless. I disclosed this drug use to my doctors to avoid any risk of contraindication.

Every semester since then, I've juggled assignments alongside hospital trips and constant hallucinations. If I take medication, I'll be violently ill, unable to stand up without immediately vomiting and fainting. I got a new mental health team, which costs me upwards of $300 every single week. That's 3x my rent per week. They reviewed my case and decided that medication was doing too much harm and I was heading into the risky territory of kidney damage, so all known medications have been discontinued permanently. That's just the price you pay for many anti-psychotics, both typical and atypical. 

My only coping mechanism has been to place my academics above all else. In the years since then, I've had weeks where I was completely disabled and weeks where I was performing at the top of my game. The only way to survive is to know how those periods work and to hyper-engineer my life around it. I keep emergency sedatives on me at all times. My supervisors also have access to these, along with the personal numbers of my treatment team. The only hospital in my state recently lost accreditation for psychiatric care because it was so abysmal, so if I fall ill now, I'm more likely to head to gaol and I'll definitely have to deal with police, who are notorious for abusing the mentally ill. 

There's no great ending here. Sure, I graduated with top honors, the 4.0, the university medal, the academic publications for maths/physics. But it doesn't mean a whole lot. Those achievements don't stop me from being ill, they don't reduce my suffering or my medical bills, and the joy from earning them lasted a grant total of about 10 minutes. My hallucinations have lasted almost 20 years. 

When you fall down, you either get back up and try again, or you get back up and go do something else. Maybe you come back to it and maybe you don't. It doesn't matter either way. You are free to do literally whatever you want, bar physical impossibilities like growing a third arm. So take a break or don't, fail or pass, do maths or do something else, just make a decision for yourself. Get career advice from your professors and health advice from doctors.

f570n0x,kdeck40,t2_hm8lz,"As a PhD student myself, some of the best advice from my advisor day 1, was not to compare yourself to anyone. (Don’t matter if your crushing it- looking down or drowning-looking up).  Hope is a funny illusion we all have because truth be told, until you get your doctoral degree- you are still very vulnerable. Overworked with minimal securities. And that’s discouraging. I like to say works comes in waves- you work over time then decompress (then repeat).  Very few people understand the true inner workings of what it takes to get a PhD. So I respect you reaching out for advice. 

As far as advice. Routines. Most people overestimate what they can do in a single day, but drastically underestimate what they can do in months/years. To get an idea... create a “to did list” where at the end of the day- write everything you have accomplished to get an idea of what’s feasible. Wake up a set time and just read something. Some focus on 60 minutes of writing a day, I find it better to just have a set time of the day 9-10am is dedicated to just “research- read/write/stats/figures/anything else. Also- make short and long term “progress goals” as opposed to “outcome goals”. What I mean... I will dedicate 30 min/5 days a week on my dissertation as opposed to- I will finish my dissertation in 3 months. The former you can measure as time goes on. 

Affirmations- no joke. Start hijacking the subconscious mind. More than “I feel great, I am great, I will succeed”. Think more “One day closer to becoming Dr.______”.... as a significant other the best you can do is clear the mind and feed the soul. Unless you’re in the same field and can offer intellectual insights. Some showing affirmations are best time right before bed or after after waking up. 

Since I do research on cardiovascular function- there is indeed merit to exercising.  Caught in a funk- switch it up and do something different. Hike, walk, bike ride, have more sex, anything physical. Life is about perspective. Immediately changing your environment can have a positive domino effect to get back on track. 

And finally- make sure mental/physical health is in check. I know too many souls victimized by the educational system demands that honestly end up so much happier/healthier when they leave. Short term solution at the cost of long term goal IMO. But hell what do I know- I could easily be in the same boat as your BF (only if I let myself). I would suggest if. leaving is the best option- make sure there is something more promising to immediately start.

crsucrs,nomely,t2_hse9b,"Hi!

This may be a long response. Hopefully I can condense it.

I have mental and physical health issues. Autoimmune, food allergies, migraines, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. Another friend nearly failed his courses due to a bad bout of depression. Another has had ongoing issues requiring major medical expense and whatnot.

It is doable. It's not even necessarily harder than what others are doing. Key things:

1. Look for a program with full funding. It's really a necessity.
2. Ask about department flexibility. Feed it into discussions about opportunities to collaborate abroad or do internships, and ask whether any students who have had family or personal emergencies and taken leave of the program have had an issue coming back. Ask the grad students as well, and try to get info specific to your advisor.
3. Check out your school's disability services. You may well qualify (I probably do, but haven't used them). Not only are there academic accommodations if you have a bad spell medically, there may be vocational rehab or other programs with financial assistance for medical bills. Don't bring this up with department members; check into it on your own.

My advice to keep it quiet initially is not because of *overt* stigma. It's just best to seem as independent as possible during the interview stage, and handle things only as they come along.

I don't think illness should keep anyone from going to grad school, assuming they know their limits and have decent coping skills. It's rough, but so is the rest of life.

Remember, your previous mentor has worked with you and doesn't seem to think it was a problem.

I may recommend against grad school for those without specific career goals (preferably in industry) that require the degree, but that's another matter... :)

Edit to add: Our disability services even has support money for grad students that they don't even have enough applicants for. It adds ""diversity"" to the department and gets you off their payroll, which, if introduced after acceptance, could be seen as a plus.",3,2015-06-02 10:37:15,AskAcademia

e3grl71,PurrPrinThom,t2_6t2ba,"There's the opportunity cost associated with academia: pursuing higher education pushes the start date of you entering the workforce back by a few years. That means that while your friends might be buying houses, starting families etc. you'll still be in school, and likely not making much money. If you've taken out student loans for your education at any stage, you'll have to push back paying them off, while your friends will have already begun to chip away at them. 

Working a lot without much pay is pretty accurate, as while many PhDs are funded, they don't exactly pay *well*. It's usually just enough to live - and frequently below minimum wage. Many programs also prohibit students from working outside of their PhD, so students are often forced to scrape by. It's also very difficult to balance what are, essentially two full-time jobs, meaning that those who *do* work outside their degree often delay finishing by a few years. Post-docs vary wildly in funding, but many do not pay particularly well either, so even after you've gotten the degree and are working, it's not as if you're starting in a well-paying job. I've seen post-docs that also pay just barely above minimum wage. 

As touched upon by u/exsuit, mental health struggles are common in academia because it feels like a race you can't possibly win. In order to get a job you need to have ample publications and teaching experience, but these things are often time-consuming and detract from your actual degree, so many of us are overworked and burnt out. There's also ""imposter syndrome,"" which is feeling like you've faked your way to where you are and you're not nearly good enough. 

Because there are so few jobs available, pursuing a career in academia - especially in the early stages - often means opening your job search to the entire world in hopes of finding something. I don't know anyone in the early stages of their research career who *hasn't* made multiple, international moves - essentially job-chasing. For many people this entails leaving a partner (and possibly children) behind, or delays having children, pets, buying a home, also means you have to leave family and friends etc. And to be clear, this isn't necessarily moving for the *best* job or a *dream* job, it's usually moving for the *only* job.

* Regular exercise. The absolute minimum for exercise is 5 days a week, 30 min per day cardio. Try the seated bikes at the gym and just bring a book. Lacking a gym subscription, get a [jump rope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYkJIOnT78). This  also helps your mind and mood.

* Meditation. Start with 10 min per day of [concentration meditation](https://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe5-6.html), and slowly work up to 20 min. This topic is kinda tricky and can take a while. It's best to find a teacher or a therapist in real life to guide you while still meditating.

fkc4hdf,oooomgg,t2_48fb8stv,"I feel like you're asking about a specific situation for you personally. 

But, let's continue with the hypotheticals. Many emails between people is not a problem, because email content (assuming you send through school servers) can be retrieved. If there's an issue with someone accusing harassment, you can just go back to those emails and show they're innocuous or work related.

If you're worried about talking to a student with the door closed, open the door. 

I would not discuss my mental health with my bosses or dean, so I don't know why I'd share it with my students. Sure, if a student came to me and wanted to express something about their own anxiety and/or depression and wanted advice, I'd let them know about my experiences and tips. Or, if my sick family member would impede our work or make me less responsive, I'd let them know.

But if you want to lean on grad students for emotional or mental health support, it'll depend on the culture of your department and norms at your school. To me, it seems highly inappropriate to share that kind of information with someone who is ""lower"" than you on the totem pole, because they're kind of obligated to listen to you. However, none of this really has to do with Me Too. It's just about oversharing in a professional space.

I don't think it's ever wise to send an email that ""I'm thinking of you"" to anyone other than a family member or close friend. At best, you seem way too earnest. At worst, creepy. I would argue you should not ask them about their personal lives unless they volunteer information. Wishing luck on exams seems innocuous because it's very related to your professional relationship.

Being with a partner who is also in academia, however, is hell because of the two body problem. I’ve seen couple split because of the constant nomadism between VAP and postdocs, or cases in which the trailing spouse has to compromise their aspirations and this ends up creating resentment. And not all relationships are good, nor are all partners supportive or even respectful of your career goals as an academic. Ultimately I think it matters little whether one has a partner or not, but it’s important to protect your own mental health. Take steps in self care, try and build a network with friends, cultivate one hobby outside of academia, interact with other people who are outside your department bubble, and remind yourself you are not your career. Oh, and don’t be ashamed to seek counseling if you’re ever hitting a rough patch-we’ve all been there.

e27vxs9,hellohello2204,t2_plckw,"I would have applied to cognitive neuroscience programs if I decided on a PhD. The advice I received was based on that, and as discussed below, psych programs are very hard to get into. There are probably more poor candidates applying (therefore lowering admission rates) because there are few decently paying jobs available to psych majors in the field with only a bachelors. In other fields, people might be more satisfied with only a bachelors or masters because there are potentially more jobs available to them. 

Anyway, I *was* a little miffed at the fact I majored in something with very low chance of me getting a TT position. You’re right about that. The point of my post was that no one I knew understood how difficult the process of getting into a program and then getting a job is. Everyone I knew in high school and my entire family figured I’d get a great paying job and get into the programs of my dreams because I was a great student. Of course, the highest degree anyone in my family got was an associates from a business trade school, so I went into college with big dreams and little knowledge of the field. My professors did warn me (certain ones anyway), but it came a little too late. So I switched focus to becoming a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner. 

I also had financial troubles that forced me to graduate early with heavy course loads along with working a lot. I didn’t have time to be part of academic frats, clubs, or take on summer internships because I needed to make at least 5,000 over the summer for school or I couldn’t finish my degree. So, even though I had 2 lab experiences and a 3.98, I did not have the stellar CVs I was competing against because I had to pay bills.

fwlweqq,variablyinstrumental,t2_fz8on,"I had a lot of trouble with this in grad school (and still do).  The biggest shift in my thinking was to treat grad school more like a job.  Unless I had a big deadline looming, I tried not to do any research outside of time that I had designed to be ""on the clock.""  (This usually meant I did TA/RA-related tasks in the evenings, after I had come home from the department, but those never felt linked to my self-worth in the way that research did.)  If I felt exceedingly anxious/exhausted on a particular day, I tried to accept that this was my body's way of indicating I needed rest and that, if I forced myself to work on research, I would be both miserable and unproductive.  A lot of it came down to trusting in my work ethic -- it is unlikely one gets to grad school without a good one, after all -- and that I would get the work done, eventually.  Knowing when to step away is an important part of the research process.

On a more practical note, hobbies are really helpful.  I think this is especially true if they let your mind work in ways different than your research.  I'm in a very quantitative field, and I found a lot of release in running, playing piano, and reading fiction.

And, on one last practical note, don't be afraid to talk through these issues with a therapist.  I wish I had known earlier than therapy is not just for people in acute mental health crises.  I would not have gotten through my PhD without it.",3,2020-07-01 18:15:49,AskAcademia

devv98r,coldseaweedsalad,t2_x20kz,"I was going to say almost the exact same thing. I don't think ""Am I worthy"" of going to grad school is really a particularly relevant question; there is a whole host of different people who do and don't get into various programs and schools based on a wide variety of merits. If you can get you, you're ""worthy"" and then all you have to do is actually finish.

So, beyond getting into grad school, you have to think about finishing grad school, and whether or not the lifestyle of being a grad student is something you want to take on, and whether or not it's compatible with where you are in your life at the moment. There are plenty of people with chronic illnesses, mental and physical, that are able to be successful academics. But if you feel like you are currently more in a ""constant crisis"" phase and not so much in a ""management and maintenance"" phase, adding the grind of grad school may not be the healthiest choice for you *right now*. That doesn't mean it never will.

(There is also the slight chance that grad school will be better for some people; for me having a lot of flexibility and independence compared to a day job has made it a lot easier to manage my health conditions, because I have more options on days when I am feeling like garbage).

You should also take into consideration what your health conditions would be like if your health insurance were to change. If you become a grad student, you might have different coverage than what you currently have, and that might impact who you can see and what kind of treatments are covered (this is assuming you're in the US).

If you are currently seeing a psychologist (which it sounds like you should consider if you aren't already), they might be a good person to talk this through with. You could mention that one of your goals is to go to grad school, and that getting yourself to a place where that is possible is something you want to target in therapy. Since your psychologist is someone who has also had to go through grad school, they might have good insight on how to help you.

But I would get away from the idea of being ""worthy"" of grad school. I don't think that there is really anyone who is unworthy, it's just a matter of what specific steps any given person will have to take and what it will demand from you.

Doesn't much of this come down to individual and institutional standards? I think if someone 'randomly walks into successful labs', there's an impetus to question how this lab is so successful, if such seemingly incompetent people can just be carried in. 

And as you say, these are usually junior career researchers. They may have barely got through their PhD, possibly in a slightly different area, and been offered a postdoc position due to appearing strong during interview, but then it might have turned out they weren't that good or motivated in that area of research (or indeed research in general). People can also have mental health problems and other issues that might affect your judgements of them when you do interact. That doesn't necessarily speak to their overall performance, and certainly I'd be doubtful of calling people useless, or especially 'impostors' based on such interactions. 

Perhaps we're differing on our definition of what an impostor is as well.

Businesses do sometimes solicit specific investigators to do stuff for them. I know of one business that has some kind of nutritional supplement that they believe improves cognitive abilities, so they gave money to a neuroscientist I know to test out their product to see if it really did improve cognition or not.

Sometimes, if you're really lucky, you don't need to ask anyone for money. I have a hypothesis that I developed years ago that has been in the back of my mind since then (that a common medical treatment can improve symptoms of a completely unrelated mental health condition). Conveniently, the institution I work for grants researchers access to an enormous database of de-identified health information that will allow me to test that hypothesis. So for that I just had to get permission to use the database, and now I can test my hypothesis and if I'm right, write a paper.",3,2016-03-07 18:16:25,AskAcademia

chx8mg0,manova,t2_35w8d,"Your major does not really matter for medicine or law.  Psychology is a popular pre-law degree.  Take elective courses in philosophy, history, political science, ethics, criminology, sociology, etc.  You should have some type of pre-law adviser on campus, and they can advise you on the best classes.  You really want to focus on your research skills and thinking analytically.  You also want to have a high overall GPA.

As for med school, you can major in psychology but you want to have a strong natural science background.  You really want to be making A's on your 1st year level science classes (biology, chemistry, calculus/stats, physics and mostly A's and a few B's on the more advanced classes, organic chem, genetics, physiology, cell bio, etc.).  You need to make all A's in your psychology classes.  The more science classes you take, the better.  Consider getting a minor in biology (or look into neuroscience if your school has it).  Look into getting involved in a professor's research lab.  Pick something interesting, research is research.  Neuroscience, psychophysiology, or health psychology would be more relevant to medicine, but anything is better than nothing and you can spin almost any areas as being relevant.  Once again, find your school's pre-med advisers. 

You can spin the benefits of having a psychology degree for either medicine or law in your personal statement.  That is all in how well you write.

As for what else you can do with psychology...basically a BS/BA in psychology is a general liberal arts degree that does not train you for anything in particular.  It can give you strong basic skills in research and critical thinking.  Where you go with that is up to you.  If you want to stay in the mental health field, the good jobs are going to usually require a graduate degree.  A psychology degree with pre-med classes (with B's or better) will be a great course background for PhD programs in either Clinical/Counseling or going into research.  Once again, working in a professor's research lab is very important.  I'm assuming that if you are thinking law or medicine, that you are more interested in the PhD and not master's.  Note that most people go for a PhD right out of undergrad, you do not need to get a master's first (but you can if you need to make your application stronger).

Asking for anything you can do between now and then is really not much in the way of demonstrating that you know the material. Plus the professor is likely swamped at the moment. Perhaps consider if it would be possible for you to take an incomplete in the course for now and then the professor can come up with appropriate make-up work for you to complete.

Professor's are people too and they understand that there are legitimate reasons why student's struggle and are often willing to work with you if you show you are willing to work with them. The problem is that professor's also get a ton of bullshit excuses and entitled students who ask for grade bumps at the last minute and you want to steer well clear.

dyhtmdy,PurrPrinThom,t2_6t2ba,"This is one of those posts where I would love to help, but I'm not sure that advice from a stranger on the internet will really do anything.

Whether or not academia is the right path for you is a pretty personal decision. Are there people with poor social skills and mental health struggles in academia? Certainly. Are there people with similar challenges who cannot handle academia? Certainly. The category you fall into is far too personal for any here to really know.

So I suppose, could you ""do something"" in academia? I really don't know, and I'm not sure anyone else here will be able to say either. Do you feel you could handle the stress and pressure of a PhD? Are you capable of conducting independent research? Do your career goals necessitate a PhD? Or is there another route that you're more confident in that you could take? 

That being said, I recognise that therapy is out of the question but it certainly sounds like you would benefit from it. The issues you list with your social skills sound more like you over-thinking situations than actual social faux-pas.

cplokx5,possiblegirl,t2_kn4vg,"This sounds like a really stressful situation, particularly if you're already prone to anxiety. I'm sorry you're in this position; having had some difficulties in my own undergraduate career (and having also graduated with a ≈3.0 GPA), I can definitely sympathize with the difficulty of dealing with the ramifications of life after college. I would second what /u/Impune has already said, and add a few other thoughts:

You mention that your mental health issues are currently largely unmanaged. I don't know the details, of course, but I would tend to recommend that you wait to apply to graduate programs until you feel you have these issues relatively under control. Grad school is a really intense environment that can bring out mental health issues even in those who might not have believed they were prone to them, and it might well exacerbate the issues with which you're struggling. (For a somewhat disturbing discussion of this, see [this article](http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/mar/01/mental-health-issue-phd-research-university).) I am *not* suggesting that people with mental health issues shouldn't go into academia; indeed, I--and many of my colleagues--have struggled with such things. But I would say that it is important to start grad school from a point of relative stability, and to have figured out reliable and healthy ways (whether this is therapy, medication, or other coping mechanisms) of maintaining that stability.

Once you have these issues reasonably sorted out, you might want to see if there's a way you can formally or informally take more courses before applying to graduate school. This would allow you to build connections that could get you stronger letters of recommendation and to potentially improve your transcript (if you were taking the courses for credit). Once you apply, I'd recommend starting with MA programs (preferably one that offers funded TAships). Like extra pre-grad school coursework, an MA can allow you to develop connections, grades, and writing samples that will make you a stronger PhD candidate. (I did both of these things--informally auditing classes and doing an MA--and they were invaluable both from a pragmatic point of view [in terms of improving a somewhat shoddy undergraduate portfolio] and from a personal point of view [in terms of helping me figure out how to navigate the academic world].)

Finally, regarding not being picky--while this is a generally good attitude to have, I'd urge you to think carefully about the costs and benefits of various programs. In the humanities, graduate programs are typically intended to prepare you for a career as a professor. And--unlike undergrad--the more highly regarded programs generally pay *you* to attend (via fellowships, TAships, etc) rather than making you pay, precisely because grad school is to a large extent a form of academic apprenticeship. If a program will require you to spend substantial amounts of money and doesn't have good job placement, I would think hard about whether it's really worth it.

ciw0hxu,SnowblindAlbino,t2_7ild5,"Yeah, you'd have to isolate the variables somehow. Your freeze proposal would easily be blocked by the claim that it was too risky-- ""how could we stay in business if we risked missing our retention goals over five years???""  But clearly it *should* be studied, rather than accepted uncritically.

I can with some certainly say, however, that in the case of my institution while the ""quality"" of the students coming in has remained steady (per ACT/SAT scores, GPA, etc.) their readiness for college and ability to self- direct toward academic goals has indeed declined. In our case that has resulted in a major increase in funding/staff for mental health services, disability services, academic support services, etc. Some of the residential life staff investments were probably necessary as well.

In your case, though, it sounds like you're having the opposite academic trend-- lower quality/less selective admission. One could counter, though, that those students come with greater need for support structures and the staff required to provide those services. How do you test that without risking failure for a significant number of students over multiple years? (""Let's close the counseling and disability services offices for a semester and see what happens."")

These evaluations are very tricky. Clearly there are ridiculous examples of featherbedding and bloat at many schools...there are far too many obvious examples to not take it seriously.

cnzc430,professorchat,t2_kfubg,"What I'm wondering is what you plan to do with your PhD, and why you're pursuing it - this would influence the response I would give you.

I'm someone who has worked full time while working on a PhD. My scenario was rather unique, and while it was really difficult, now that I'm nearing the end, I see that it was the right thing for me. The reason is: I'm going to hit the academic and professional job market with nearly seven years of full time professional experience that's directly related to my degree (plus being able to maintain a decent standard of living, having retirement accounts, broadening my network, paying off student loans, saving for a house). I've also been able to keep a similar time table to my peers who had GA positions, or didn't work at all. 

Would I recommend it? Absolutely not. Can some people do it? Sure.

Why I don't recommend doing it: Burn out, burn out, burn out. The feeling of constantly treading water just to stick your face above it isn't a pretty one. You'll constantly be split between your job and your academic work, never really able to give 100% to either. I find that concerning if you're a mental health professional, as your clients need to be 100% present. 

As some of the other posters mentioned, going to an institution that's not going to support you in some capacity isn't really invested in you. However, in the field you're interested in, the financial support isn't really going to be that solid to begin with, unless you're going to a top program. There's a big difference between a ~20k stipend, and a full time professional salary, so I can see why you would still want to keep your day job if you have debts.

In addition to these reasons, the most important thing to remember is that life happens to all of us. The challenges I've faced in this process (and my peers, too) are going to be a true test of your grit and resilience, and not necessarily in a good way. Issues of health, exhaustion, relationships, death, family, whatever...they're going to happen - and you're still going to have to write. Consider if that's something you really want to deal with in addition to your job and other responsibilities. If it is, then that's a huge skill you'll need to maintain as an academic - it's the kind of work that never really leaves you. That's sort of the beauty of a lot of full time jobs, many of them, you can leave at the office. With academic work, it's ALWAYS with you.

Do an internship with a company, try to get your lab involved in a ""applied project"" wrt to the research you do, or try to do some research-for-hire. If you're in Canada, look into MITACs.

And for godsake, go get some [career counseling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career_counseling) and then go to your career centre. You have no idea how much your job impacts your mental health, and career counselors can be sooo helpful. University career centres can also help you identify your marketable skills, help you turn your CV into a resume, and might be able to hook you up with a business mentor or internship.

I was useless when I finished my PhD. I tried to get a job outside of academia, but I had no marketable experience. Any job where it didn't hurt me that I had a PhD required 7 years + experience, and any job that would help me get experience didn't want to touch a PhD with a 10 foot pole. It costs organizations money to train you, and if you are likely to leave within 6 months, it will cost too much... someone with a PhD is overqualified, and is likely to leave. So, you don't even get an interview.

My biggest mistake: I didn't look into career counseling or career centres until I was a post-doc, and those sort of resources are for students (""fuck post-docs"").

eubur7m,NTGuardian,t2_10is70,"A cheap shot would be to say that Normal random variables have no minimum or maximum so since there is a minimum or maximum grade, grades cannot be Normally distributed. This is a cheap shot because lots of phenomena that's effectively bounded this way are fit to Normal distributions and no one bats an eye since the probability of being that far away from the mean is vanishingly small (albeit non-zero). However it could matter to grades since a larger standard deviation in grades and clumping of grades near the higher end of the distribution could mean that the probability of seeing an impossibly high grade is higher than tolerable if the grades were modeled with a Normal random variable.

Next we should agree the the objective of grades is to measure students' understanding and competency, with an ""A"" grade meaning ""This student has mastered the material"" and an ""F"" meaning ""This student is not competent in the material"", which ranges anywhere from the student knowing something about the material but not enough to the student basically knowing nothing at all about the material. If the class size is somewhat small, it will be hard to see a Normal distribution naturally arise due to the natural fluctuation of students' innate ability. It's easier for instructors to get ""smart"" classes where the students overall are above-average, and also to get classes where the students are not like that. Part of this is just randomness, part is associated with semester and time of day. But there should be some natural variation due to random sampling that can make natural grades not look exactly Normal with some specified mean and variance. This could be less of a problem for ""jumbo"" classes, though.

Now let's talk about grading. There's likely some scheme that awards points to students based on their performance. These schemes are never perfect and always arbitrary but there's generally some truth in the resulting numbers. Some people say that grading this way produces bimodal distributions, suggesting there's clumps of students that either do or do not get the material. I often observe left-skewed distributions, where most students range between mediocre to good, some are great, and some are *catastrophically bad*. Neither of these are features of Normal distributions.

So to get a Normal distribution one would have to take grading based off of points then determine each student's percentile in the class and then see what the corresponding grade would be for the respective percentiles if grades were actually Normally distributed.

Two things: first, this produces a distortion in how points work. You get non-linear benefits for points scored on anything, from homework to quizzes to tests. Specifically, it's possible for the third point to be more valuable to your grade than the second point, and the second less valuable than the first. This is technically already true since grades are generally thresholds, but each point has an equal contribution (withing their own assignment) to reaching a particular threshold. This will not be the case if grades are curved. Students are going to struggle to understand and appreciate that.

Second: when you're doing this, the Normal distribution actually doesn't matter. You're effectively assigning grades based on percentiles, not Normal percentiles specifically. You could make the grades fit any distribution you want this way, from Normal to uniform to beta to Cauchy to exponential and so on forever. You're just saying that the lowest 20% will get Fs and the highest 20% will get A's (or the lowest 5% will get Fs and the highest 5% will get As, if you're actually sticking to a Normal distribution). But you're putting artificial distance between, say, the students at the top; two top students could have mastered the material but one got an extra point because of luck, yet her grade will look *much* better than the other stellar student. This is because of how tails work in the Normal distribution. In fact, if students at the top figured this out, they'd start obsessing over every single point because every point would have a big impact on their grade, which would be bad for their learning and mental health.

So summing up (or **tl;dr**): aside from being literally impossible, natural student grades don't look like they're Normally distributed; they have statistical features Normal random variables don't exhibit, and there should be natural variation in scores. When you force grades to follow a Normal distribution, you must distort the value of points and in the end are just grading based off of percentiles, which doesn't seem fair.",3,2019-07-20 21:18:50,AskAcademia

If you don’t absolutely need the PhD, it’s a huge commitment in terms of time, stress, and lost potential wages. So many people are ending up in jobs outside of academia because there aren’t enough spots for all of the new PhDs being produced. If you think that you’ll end up outside of academia, I’d think long and hard about whether to commit to the PhD.

As someone who’s in the biomedical sciences, here’s what my experience has been. My goal has been to stay in academia since I started doing research seven years ago, but I’m now about halfway through my PhD and am not sure if I should continue trying to pursue academia once I’m done. I knew intellectually what the pay situation would be like when I was in undergrad applying, but the reality of it is that being poor is REALLY stressful. I can make ends’ meet but I’m constantly terrified that if I have any big, unexpected expense, I’ll be totally fucked. I don’t know if I can do this for another five years or so as a postdoc while grinding my way towards an academic post that will most likely never materialize. I’m not able to put much money away for retirement at all right now, and the prospect of god knows how many more years of that absolutely terrifies me.

e1rbdid,odway,t2_sqpe7,"This could literally be me, only in a different field.

It took me 7 years to finish - I didn’t make the most of the years that I had a stipend, and then I suffered through the ‘full time work, spare time phd’ act for what felt like forever, the whole time wondering “what’s the f\*ing point?! I have no future in academia, I hate this and it’s costing me everything” (health, mental well-being, happiness etc). I would work a 9-5, then come home, walk the dog, eat dinner with my partner and attempt to spend some quality time with him (all those other life things that we also need to do justice to) then head to bed with my alarm set for some obscure time between midnight and 2am (thankyou [sleepyti.me](http://sleepyti.me/)). Then I would pull myself out of the warm bed and my partner’s arms to go to a lonely, cold study, squeeze in a few hrs crappy work while exhausted, then back to bed around 5.30am for a power nap before starting the day again. I would say no to extracurricular activities because I ‘had to work on my PhD’ but then would procrastinate all day and then hate myself even more for it. Weekends were the worst because when it got to 10pm Sunday and I hadn’t finished that section I’d imagined knocking off then the stress and sense of failure became overwhelming. It was hell. I would cry in the car every day to work, and then put on a smile and a solid work ethic until 5pm when I could fall apart again (yes I was in therapy). Rinse and repeat for years until it was finished.

Was it worth it?

For me it was, and I have a sneaking suspicion you’re like me, so it’ll probably be worth it for you too. Why else would you still be in the program? Like you, I would agonise over whether I should quit (I even posted a ‘should I quit’ post to reddit at around year 4 – also on a throwaway because that’s how paranoid I was about being judged), and people would keep telling me I was so close and to just keep going. And my response to them was I didn’t care, because it was causing me so much grief and suffering, and there was still so much to do, and I didn’t need the PhD anyway so why should I keep going?! But yet I didn’t quit, even though I had plenty of opportunity to. Like you, I was my supervisor’s first student (and in the meantime others started and completed), but by the end I didn’t care about disappointing her or even pleasing her, it became about me. And all I knew was that if I didn’t finish, that perceived failure would stick with me for the rest of my life. And I didn’t need that shadow haunting me forever.

So I might be going against what others have said here, but I vote that you apply for a short extension (your grandmother and depression are more than cause enough), then meet with your supervisor and come up with a completion plan you can both get behind, rather than pushing through these last 4 weeks in turmoil. Then I would aim to write 200 words a day. They don’t even need to be good words, just put something down in your thesis document. Every day after you’ve done that, also write out ‘Dr Sadthrowaway667’ a few times for good measure. It might be poxy, but it helped me. Just do that, let the momentum build, and trust me very soon you’ll wake up and be ready to submit something that you’re mostly happy with (and that is a truly amazing feeling!).

I finished six months ago and graduate in December, and honestly, the sense of achievement, having friends jokingly call me ‘doc’ all the time, and just the overall feeling of freedom, success, pride, and accomplishment... it’s so, so worth it. In my experience, the rewards have been proportional to the suffering.

So OP, you *have* got this, you *can* do it, and you *will* do it if you want it enough (and if you don’t want it that’s fine too, but then make a meeting with your supervisor now and quit before you’re forced to fail out of circumstances).

Their mother was dealing with a lot of health issues at that time, so instead of finding a new school they started working full time. They've struggled, living paycheck to paycheck since then, spending some time living with their mother, before finally just last year getting into a program that will help them complete their GED in hopes of eventually furthering their education so they can get a job that will make them more than minimum wage.

Most people who drop out of high school don't do it because they are ""lazy"" or because it's ""easier"" to quit - they often do it because of circumstances beyond their control, because of coming from low income families that need the extra money from them having a job as soon as possible, because of dealing with discrimination, because of physical and/or mental health issues, because they aren't receiving the support they need to do well or feel engaged in their education.

You are not ADHD. You have ADHD, which you only found out recently, having completed a bachelor's degree that came with deadlines and time restrictions. ADHD didn't impede you there, why now? 

ADHD is prevalent among graduate students and postdocs. So are depression, social and general anxiety, OCD, etc. Guess what? They get degrees and publications. I know an emeritus professor who is a legend in their field who has diagnosed depression and takes medication for it, and I know established, but not famous, professors with mental health conditions, too. 

I don't know why you are required to tell your advisor. I'm not implying you have to distrust your advisor, but I see no reason for it when you are unlikely to perform any differently from other graduate students. Everyone sucks in graduate school, just like professors suck during the uphill battle for tenure. The clean shaven man always with a smile, active and talkative, to the guy holing up in their office with stubble, droopy eyes, blank expression, and seen only where they're obligated to be during grant writing season. Don't worry, they come back to the living.

Funding is time sensitive, but what funding? Your stipend? Grants? You're a graduate student, of you're not getting help to move things along at all, you're the one screwed over. Get your treatment for ADHD by the psychiatric and psychological professionals who will point you to appropriate resources tailored for graduate students, and get your research specific help by the your advisor, committee, department, whatever who have the job to get you where you need to be. 

You are not alone. You're surrounded by those of the same, equivalent, and even more difficult struggles. Have faith. The only conclusion to your journey is the conclusion; don't create a self-fulfilling prophecy; don't worry about failing others at the cost of enjoying your passion.

This kind of thing is actually quite common. For various reasons, including health, people hit a wall at some stage during their thesis. The only thing to do is just move on, forget about it, get writing. Remember that the hardest thing to do is to write, but once you have accepted that it is always hard, and hard for everyone most of the time if not all of the time, then you realise that the only thing to do is to just sit down and do it. 

I'd also recommend that you might consider seeking some form of extension or remittance from your university. Depression is an illness. I have had students take time out because of back trouble that made writing impossible. The same should apply for mental illness and indeed frequently does. Something you had no control over took you out of the game for a period of months, and that's not something to be ashamed of. I totally understand the feelings of guilt or even shame, which are both part of depression and socially produced by the way (some) people still react to mental health difficulties. But any well informed professional academic should have a clear understanding that depression happens to lots of people and it's just an obstacle to be overcome. It's not the same as physical illness, but it's not all that different either. 
So to summarise, you'll be fine. Just get writing and try to forget about the past. If you can access supports in your university, do so, and do so without guilt or remorse or shame. What you are experiencing has happened in some shape or form to most of the students I have supervised and all of them got through.  ",3,2018-01-08 11:31:48,AskAcademia

She did grade for one class in that time to keep her fellowship but that was it as far as I know. I don't think that taking maternity makes you any less of an ambitious and hard working academic. Some departments have very toxic cultures, and ultimately it's up to you to decide how much you want to accept that (not that I am in any way condoning these toxic environments! Just to say that in my observation, universities will take without remorse as much of you as you are willing to give). This is your life, and you should prioritize the opinions of your supervisor vs the time with your child as is important to you, however that may be. I am truly sorry that it seems you are in the position to choose one or the other.

I still have mental health issues. I'm not done yet and it's a daily struggle. Sometimes I question why I am here, was this worth it for me, and whether it is worth it to continue.

Thankfully I have an advisor and department that are very understanding. But I'm here, I'm over halfway done, and I won't give up.

I would say, overall, if it is something that you want, you should go for it. Consider starting with an MS. Make psych appointments and keep them. Get or stay on some medication and a therapy plan.

I'd been wearing short sleeves with visible scars for most of my undergrad (long sleeves when any cuts were new, but short sleeves otherwise). If a peer who should know better asks, the answer is ""rabid squirrel attack. They may look cute, but they're vicious little fuckers."" That's usually enough to change the subject while indicating that I don't want to go into it. Very few people do ask though. If a peer asks with genuine concern, I'm usually willing to discuss it with them, with varying degrees of personal info depending on how well I know them. If an adult unfamiliar with self harm or someone who grew up in a different environment where it's not as common asks, I usually just opt for ""long story,"" and leave it at that. It's not that I couldn't discuss it, but if they don't realize what they're asking it would be uncomfortable to explain. 

I would be able to discuss it with a prof, if it comes up. I have in the past during undergrad. It's not my favorite thing to do, but I'm fine with it. 

The answer to the second one is more complicated. I've dealt with the issues that caused me to attempt suicide. Self harm isn't intrinsically bad though, and I still do it on occasion. Some people go for a run to clear their mind and get endorphins. I cut. It's not the best option, but I'm more focused on working on my underlying issues than actually trying to quit. If I try to quit cutting, I'm more likely to turn to other, more dangerous, maladaptive coping mechanisms. So I still do it, a lot less frequently than I used to, and in places that aren't visible. If it comes up, I'll let them know that I'm in therapy and on medication. 

As for the other part, I'm too emotionally sensitive. But I'm emotionally sensitive about anything and everything, whether it's a high-stress environment or not. I think that overall academia is what's best for my mental health (ironic, right?), because it gives me a community of people who are weird like I am, and it keeps me busy solving puzzles. My mental health was best when I was spending 12+ hours a day in lab one summer of my undergrad, and doing so because I was so excited about my project. I get stressed about deadlines and expectations, but boredom and free time are also terrible for my mental health in their own way. 

In my interactions, very few people would know that I was sensitive. I tend to appear fairly confident and self-assured. There are moments where insecurity can sneak through my walls, but I've gotten better at controlling it over the years, depending on context. Like when I TAed, my students always saw me as confident and competent, even when I was struggling with my own mental health at the time, and I'm pretty much the poster child for impostor syndrome.

So keeping in mind that my advisor and lab all know my shit, which isn't normal probably, here's my two cents.

If you have any say in the choice of lab, I would keep your arms covered. That way when you get to pick which of the pis you liked, you can ask them instead of having all the PIs know.

However, if it's assignned/up to the PIs, I wouldn't cover them. You want an advisor who recognizes the worth of your work. Also, as an advisor, I'd be more reassured by someone who is open and in treatment than someone who is hiding and could possibly have a meltdown with no support.

*1) Publish more. One thing that holds me back is losing interest in a project before it is complete, thus slowing down progress. Finish projects before disinterest sets in.

*2) When you get stuck, don't spend too much time trying to fix it alone. Learn to ask for help.

*3) Closely related to #2: get more face time with others, especially more senior people. Ask questions, show that you are engaged, curious, knowledgeable. Their recommendation is often THE most important part of your application to the next position. Talk to others at conferences and to those visiting to give seminars. Forming a network of academic friends and colleagues makes a world of difference. If people on a hiring committee already know you and like you, you will almost always be chosen over someone with a couple extra papers.

*4) More than just work hard, prioritize your time. When you are at the lab/office, get stuff done and don't procrastinate. But be sure to have time set aside, explicitly to not work. This will help make you more efficient when you are working and maintain your mental health. Getting that TT position is not worth a mental breakdown or 10 years off your life.

*5) If you have to TA as a grad student, be wary of giving students too much of your time. Do a good job and enjoy it, it can be fun. But also keep in mind that a PhD is a research degree.

duhp727,khaleesi_onthatbeat,t2_lfjpqys,"I deal with this issue and i’m not even a phd student. I’m paying for my full undergrad out of pocket, no loans or scholarships available to me (im not studying in the us) while working 3 jobs on top of a full course load to cover my tuition costs and living expenses. I literally live off of rice, eggs and kimchi most days and have no social life at all and keeping up with studying and work requires sacrificing sleep and social interaction and mental well-being overall. I share a tiny studio apartment (only one room and a small bathroom- no separate kitchen or living space) with a friend and walk everywhere i can to avoid even public transportation fees. I skip meals regularly, and eat free food at work whenever i can. the only “investment” i’ve made for my health was my gym membership at my school and i wake up at 5am to go there before my day of classes and work officially begins. Every cent i earn goes to paying bills and i’m currently in a deficit too, behind on rent but cant get more hours and its SO stressful. 

Like you though this is also my second time in school and i feel like i am obligated to see it through to the end even if i die as soon as i receive my damn diploma! But things like emergency medical expenses, accident or like my slowly dying laptop are what make it unsettling indeed! 

The system is shit and unfortunately this is what situation we are given and we cant do much to fix it while we’re in it. 

If i were you, I would stick it out for your remaining two years and figure out how to cut your budget down to the bare minimum. If you have a credit card stay on top of any bill payments and stuff first and foremost, so that you have the credit to take a loan out if you need to in the event of an emergency. 

Figure out all the best ways to get access to free food and coffee near your home or lab too! Campus events, food kitchen, faculty lounge that’s always empty....

Hell, our tap water isnt really best for drinking so i carry a backpack full of like 5-6 2Liter bottles and fill them up at the water stations on campus and steal rolls of toilet paper all the time, napkins and sugar packets from cafes...If your school cafeteria is like a buffet kind of style bring containers and take extra food home. Considering how much it costs to go to school taking “advantage” of some things doesnt make me feel guilty at all lol

And eat rice. Its cheap and easy and keeps you full. Collect coupons, always look out for sales. If you live near a wholesale store, get your home products there to stock up for your remaining two years... (toothpase, detergent, soap, etc) and basic staple foods (ie milk and bread for some people) Some local grocery stores discount some of the produce before closing time so do your grocery shopping at night. Also, if i recall correctly, Beans and spam and tuna are usually good cheap sources of protein in the States. 

Complain often and make sure everyone knows how miserable you are. Eventually the system will change, but it wont happen overnight and bringing awareness to the problem is the nest you can do. And also get the stress of it off your chest lol ",3,2018-02-19 14:37:03,AskAcademia

dj8yuex,dataispower,t2_ekpaj,"&gt; he doesn't see much research related to it in his field

That professor must mean in their very specific subfield of neurology. Each professor will be in a certain field, like neurology, but will mainly only do research in a very small subfield. For instance, my advisor is in robotics, but is mostly just focused on how to move certain types of robot arms.

&gt; Should I just get a normal job and write or do research and write

In order to make an informed decision on this, you need to get some research experience. Ask your professors if there is any way you can volunteer in their lab. Express your interest in mental health and they *might* be able to find a way to tie your volunteer work to mental health. Or, ask if there is another professor at the school that is more focused in that area. Don't forget that each professor should be listed on the department's website, and they should have individual pages that outline their research. Search those pages for a while and see if you can find somebody that lists mental health. Another option is to check if there is any class related to mental health at your school, and then contact the instructor. The main thing is that you just have to keep trying to contact people.

&gt; I just want your opinion(s) on what field I should go into If i wanted to make the biggest impact on Mental Health.

This really depends on you. Mental health is a field that can be examined from several different viewpoints - psychology, psychiatry, neurology, etc. You can probably even study how to affect mental health with human-computer interaction. What field you go into will depend on how you want to look at mental health - do you want to study it from a mood disorder viewpoint, or from a chemical imbalance viewpoint (I am not in medical fields, sorry if this is not the correct terminology for the neurology side of things)? Do you want to focus on understanding the symptoms or do you want to study medication for mental health problems? These are questions that should be answered before making a decision on what field you focus on.

Here is what I'd recommend:

1) Find a professor (or *all* of the professors) at your school studying mental health from any field, and contact them about helping with any research they do.

2) Take a survey of classes related to mental health: psychology, biology, chemistry, and maybe more fields depending on your school. Take several courses in each (if possible) to see which of these fields you enjoy the most, and figure out how that field can contribute to understanding mental health.

While it seems like the circumstances you mentioned are causing most of your anxiety, consider that these circumstances might to some extent be the effect of your current mental health. My biggest piece of advice would be to speak to a counselor or therapist. It's rather blase, but they really are good at their jobs, and a good therapist can work wonders. 

Second, don't worry about your career prospects right now. The point of a liberal arts degree is not to simply make you more employable, i.e., the product of a cost-benefit analysis. The beauty of a liberal arts education is that it frees you (""liberal"") to live the life of the mind even outside academia. You don't have to enter the academy or do a PhD to appreciate good art and read powerful works of literature. Regardless of what you end of doing for a career, you're being specially equipped by a liberal arts education to follow your intellectual pursuits to your heart's content.

As for employability, this is an area where the humanities and liberal arts take a lot of flak. But the truth is, as I'm sure you know, studies have shown that liberal arts majors are just as employable as anyone else, and sometimes more desired because of their reading comprehension, critical thinking, and writing skills, etc. It's cliche, but you'll be fine with regards to occupation. You have a ton of time left to figure out what you like to do (your college's career center is invaluable here), and something will always work out. Don't overthink yourself into thinking you regret the choices you made. 

So, for the time being, don't worry about academia. Focus on your mental health first and your studies second, visit your college's career center, and everything else will eventually fall into place. We're rooting for you!",3,2020-09-13 16:50:48,AskAcademia

g57gjyw,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"Mental health is part of health, and if your friend is considering acting on their suicidal thoughts, their depression would constitute a life-threatening condition.

To answer some of your specific questions:

* I do not know if your friend would be able to remain on campus. My guess is yes if they remain enrolled (e.g., pausing for a few weeks) and less likely if they withdraw from the semester.

* How a semester would be completed would vary--for example, it may look different if they are mostly taking classes or mostly doing research. For classes, some options include withdrawing or taking an incomplete to have additional time to complete coursework after the semester has finished.

Frankly, if your friend is suicidal to an extent that they are considering a leave of absence, the biggest priority needs to be their safety; it is OK if they cannot return to their graduate program within a couple of weeks, and getting the care they need is more important than finishing coursework this semester. It's okay if they take a long pause and okay if they choose to leave the program entirely to be in a less stressful space or closer to support networks. Of course, suicidality is a spectrum--some folks may be seriously thinking about suicide but have no intention of making a suicide attempt, whereas others may be seriously considering an attempt and need intensive psychiatric services. Ultimately, how severe your friend's suicidality is (a determination for mental health professionals to make) may determine how likely they are to be in a position to return this semester.

Finally, supporting a friend who is suicidal can be incredibly stressful: there is so much fear that goes with it, and it is difficult, as a friend, to know what may be an emergency and what may be concerning but not quite an emergency.

Sure, probably, but the more important question is whether you will be well suited to a grad program given the issues you've been experiencing. Grad school isn't kind. 

The early adult years are a crappy time for mental illness and it's made worse by lack of access to services in one way or another. These things do get better and your situation with your meds should improve, and with time you'll develop a better range of coping skills through good therapy.

&gt;I still do it on occasion

This might end up being a bigger problem with your future PI than scars from your past. They will be more concerned about where you are now. The relationship between a PI and a grad school is a bit like a marriage, a bit like being a parent, and a bit like a traditional manager-employee relationship. A good PI will be invested in your success, emotionally as well as professionally. 

My advice would be to hide the issue for the length of your rotations. If you reveal the problem to one PI, they might privately mention it to their colleagues. After all, if they barely know you, they will feel a greater sense of loyalty towards the other PI's they have known for years. For faculty who haven't gotten tenure yet, each grad student is critical to their future. Whether they get tenure or not will depend significantly on the achievements of the handful of students they advise. This relationship works both ways. While you are sure that working 12 hours a day solving a gnarly research problem is the best thing for your mental health, your PI will need to be confident that you being part of their lab would be a net positive. Grad students crash and burn frequently. Years of hard work a PI put in amount to very little. Some grad students kill themselves. The emotional fallout can devastate the entire lab. One my friends in grad school killed herself. Another ran away abruptly and cut off contact with everyone. 

Reveal the issue once you have found the lab you like and have proven yourself. Your PI needs to know you can handle stressful situations and produce good research. Once that is no longer in question, you are home free. You don't want to end up being the person everyone treats with kid gloves. A lot of grad students have difficult pasts and end up being a stronger person for it.

Say your doctor has told you that when you feel an attack coming on, you need to - breathe cold air, dry air, humid air, drink cold water, etc.  Something you can't get in the meeting room.  It's close to the truth and there's no reason they should deny it.

dqfp9ik,PlasticWhisperer,,"On an interdisciplinary project, first remember that the other disciplines have been brought in because they have something to offer to the work.  I understand it's frustrating to start from square one to learn this new approach, almost like being an undergrad in your foundational classes again.  However, these new disciplines can offer surprising insights if you put in the work.

As for general grad school motivation, it is natural for your enthusiasm to vary.  Some weeks, your project is working well and you can't wait to get to it each day.  Others, you feel as if you're not getting anywhere and it can be difficult to get out of bed.  Separating out your work into multiple project lines, or splintering off a minor subproject or two, can be helpful because they give you something productive to work on when the main project is being stubborn.  There is also nothing wrong with occasionally just taking a weekend for yourself, recentering by doing something relaxing, and coming back fresh.  Giving the back of your mind time to play around with your work is an important part of research, and can lead to ""aha"" moments.

Lastly, if you feel you may be suffering from anxiety, depression, or any other mental or emotional issues, please seek out your institution's counseling office.  We often hear that grad school is suffering, and you just have to gut it out, but this is not the case.  Grad school is difficult and frustrating, yes, but it should not cause you to compromise your mental health.  That is a lie higher education has been telling for centuries.

I'm not sure what your professor told you would happen next. If it's a matter of just taking the zero, that seems fair enough. Having been on the other side, something as small as having a classmate add your name to an in-class assignment (which would be difficult to prove you asked for--it was your classmate who wrote it down) seems unlikely to trigger a major academic integrity report or hearing--frankly, they have bigger fish to fry.

dogz1je,LentiviralLatte,," My currently life seems to parallel your own so I empathize with your situation. Honestly, as I read this I thought it was something I had written myself. This seems to be an innate nature in the environment of academia and you are not alone.  Conducting individual research requires a level of dedication and passion that even the average person could not handle, and even with the best mental health state. I attempted to seek out advice from my PI and mentor, neither of whom were very receptive. They both expressed that they cared about my well being, but I also felt there was a level of disappointment; that I wasn't as capable as they thought I was (of course my anxiety also blew this out of proportion). They wanted to see my prosper but there was not much in their realm they could do to help. 

There is definitely an ""every man for themselves"" kind of environment in academia. It's like even your collaborators are your competitors. And this isn't a conducive environment for depression. It's easy to feel isolated. 

If you had asked me 2 years ago where I would see myself after my undergraduate, I would have immediately said getting my PhD. But now, as I am in my final year of undergraduate, I am deciding to go another path. For the sake of my mental health. I know that research was once something that I was driven to do, and that I loved to do, but depression strips away those emotions. I am instead planning on working in the industry, getting more lab experience, but outside of the cut throat academic setting. It will give me time to focus on building myself back up so I can continue on with the things I once loved. 

Remember, this feeling isn't because you aren't successful or that you aren't worthy of the praise of the work and dedication you have already put in. It's hard to motivate yourself to go through the motions of research when it seems like everyone else is pushing forward.

do2vitv,riggorous,,"&gt; Even if I don’t enjoy it that much, using all of my mental faculties to focus on solving something makes me rise above the bullshit that surrounds me and makes me feel less alienated.

This logic mirrors the thinking of a close friend of mine who went into academia partly for the reasons you cite, and what happened afterwards was a bit sad, so I just want to give an fyi. Academia is full of bullshit. It's an ossified dinosaur of a system, and the bureaucracy/hierarchy/petty nonsense is on par with federal government work. Academics spend a lot of time writing grants, navigating department politics, fixing what collaborators fucked up without pissing anyone off, doing ""service commitments"", etc. You get double that work at double the inability to say anything to anyone as a grad student/post doc, too. So my friend, who has depression and also feels much better when he's doing ""great things"" with his mind, went into academia about 10 years ago, he's still not a PI, and his mental health has suffered a lot due to the amount of busywork he has to do and also due to the fact that he doesn't deal very well with setbacks in his research. I'm not saying this is the experience of every mentally ill person in academia, just saying that academia is far of a panacea for anyone's mental illness - in fact, it is usually a major stressor.

That said, a PhD is 5-10 years out of your life, but it's not life-ending. tbh you do sound like you're mainly doing this because you have unresolved emotional issues around your family/the unfairness of the world/your self-worth, but that's not indication that you can't finish a PhD. idk what your field is, but if it doesn't confine you to pretty much only working in academia, you might break even on the time and money investment, and hey, maybe you'll find the experience worthwhile.

f4u906k,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"First of all, I'm glad to hear that you're sober (congratulations on nearly three months!) and getting support for your mental health.

You asked how honest you should be, and I agree it's worth considering how much detail you'd like to share with your professor. You can note that you experienced a serious health concern broadly, share that it was a mental health concern specifically, or choose to share that you were grappling with addiction. You can share that you spent the summer putting a lot of time, effort, and energy into your recovery and that you're in a better place. 

There's not a right or wrong amount of information to share. I do think it's worth considering that there are pros and cons to sharing less or more. A potential pro is that the more information he has, the more he can consider it to understand what was going on for you (especially knowing that your mental health concerns were very serious). A potential con is that there is considerable stigma about mental health concerns, and that that could further color how your professor views you depending on his views. It's also up to you how much you feel comfortable sharing (you shouldn't feel pressure to share anything you don't want to). 

As far as rebuilding trust, you may have to accept that you have lost his trust (or some of his trust). You're not taking more classes with him, and I would not recommend taking on more projects at this point in time, so it is what it is. Hopefully, your other experiences outside of the summer left a strong positive impression. And he may take what you went through into consideration, too. Also, honesty and opening up can build trust; your meeting with him to share what you experienced while also acknowledging and apologizing for your mistakes is a good first step.

It sounds like you're being hard on yourself. I get that--I probably would be too if I were in your shoes. But I also hope you can have some self-compassion for yourself. Mental health concerns are serious, and it's not your fault for experiencing them. It sounds like you took initiative to get treatment and have been actively engaged with that. It's unfortunate that that affected your summer project, certainly. But life happens and it sounds like you're doing the best that you can to get back on your feet.

To go back to my abusive partner comparison, if you want to leave a relationship but the other person says they are depressed and you leaving will make it worse are you then compelled to stay? No. That would be toxic as hell.

Someone having mental health issues isn't their fault, but it *is* their responsibility. And they can't demand others take more responsibility for managing it than they do themselves.

If a student has any issues that impair their learning they should seek out the relevant disability services and arrange any accommodations that are necessary and proportionate. From a legal perspective reasonable accommodations should be made, but they must first be *sought*, and again, I stress the word *reasonable*. As long as someone is being professional and sticking to rules and policies then you can't expect more of them. You sure as hell can't force someone to accept an apology and ""reconcile"". That is up to the wronged party to decide, and the person who wronged them doesn't get to act like the injured party if they refuse. An apology isn't meant to be for the benefit of the one apologising. This isn't just relevant here, it is true in all walks of life. Heck, I'm sure you realise a forced reconciliation wouldn't be sincere, so what? Do you expect an Oscar winning performance of the wronged party acting like everything is forgiven?

Real talk time: Given your dogged responses to this post I took a look at your post history. And ooh boy. Enough people have told you that what you did with your professor, chair and dean was wrong, and I'm not going to retread old ground. And I'm not a psychiatrist, much less your psychiatrist, so I'm not going to go into your specific mental health concerns.

But straight up, on an intellectual level, you need to understand that your impression of academia and how people within it should act and treat one another (and I suspect this would extend to the rest of the world should you join the non-academic workforce) is very *very* off. Whether you feel it or not, you need to *know* that your expectations do not align with reality and other people's perceptions. 

You may invest a lot emotionally in some people\*, or your idea of those people, but you aren't owed the same in return. As long as someone treats you with civility you can expect nothing more from them. This will be true in school/college/grad school/business or industry. When you try and force it you make things worse. And when you demand that they accept your apology you make it abundantly clear that you are apologising because you want forgiveness, and you want to feel better, not because you want them to feel better. You should know this by now. And mental health might get you some understanding, but it doesn't get you a free pass, nor can you use it to get your way. That comes closer to being manipulative than I think you want it to be.

cizm1r2,ender17,t2_43u6g,"Clinical psyc PhD student here.  If you can get a job doing research, that would be a great move.  You'll get the experience to decide if pursuing a PhD is something you're game for, and if so, you'll have the experience on your resume to help you get in.  If you hate research and want to go the more clinical route, there is nothing wrong with an MSW.  Friend of mine just finished her MSW and got a job at a school making a reasonable starting salary.  Burn out is an issue everyone in mental health care has to proactively address, and we discuss strategies for this in our training.

While it likely will not make you money, I'd recommend trying to find a volunteer clinical position as well.  As an undergrad, I worked on a general mental health crisis hotline and a sexual assault crisis hotline.  Those places train you and can be very supportive experiences, depending on the site.  That experience will also be two-fold: it will help you decide if you want to do clinical work in the real world and, if so, it will help you get into a MSW/PhD/PsyD program.

If you take a year or two after you get your BA to do work that is related to psyc, you will be much more competitive if you apply to grad school (thinking here of PhD specifically - with good grades I would bet you could get into an MSW straight away).  

Do not do what other people want you to do.  This is your life, and it isn't a dress rehearsal.  I remember the stress of trying to make these decisions, and the uncertainty makes for a difficult time.  At the same time, it's exciting because so many doors are open to you.

It is absolutely the case that there are pros and cons to MSW vs PhD vs PsyD.  For me, PhD was the right choice because 1) I do not pay for my degree, I get paid to get my degree, 2) I am interested in forensic assessment for the courts, which prefer the PhD.  I am sometimes jealous of my friends who I graduated undergrad with, as they have just finished their MSWs while I am starting year 3 of my PhD program.

I'm sorry to hear that. As /u/ThSGM pointed out, in cases like these, it's usually very helpful to have someone at your current school who can vouch for your character and academic abilities. Perhaps you can speak to one of the teachers in the courses that you did well in? 

E-mails are very easy to disregard, in my experience. Or answer bluntly. I would argue that a call is a good way to go, since you won't have to make a 3-hour train journey only to find the office closed or the person unhelpful. If possible, contacting the disability services department at the school might be a good first point of contact. They can then refer you onwards to other people if need be. 

I'm not doubting that your course has made your depression worse, but simply saying ""I didn't like my course of study"" isn't likely to impress the people making admissions decisions. Having good marks in the course you want to go on instead will help. Having good marks in the course you want to go on and a letter from someone vouching for your abilities in that course will help further. If that letter can also vouch for your past mental health issues and say that you have been proactive in addressing them, that will likely help you a great deal.

The most common reason for not finishing (and having to return to retake the class entirely) is actually when a student simply disappears. That happens maybe once a year on average...they'll miss a deadline (i.e. no draft or something), stop responding to emails from the instructor, and then simply never show up again. Obviously some kind of avoidance issue, usually linked to addiction or mental health issues, but that's the one place I draw the line: if the student won't *try* and can't be bothered to respond to faculty efforts to contact them, I tell my colleagues to urge them to withdraw or assign an F.

In brief: as you know, mental health is a long haul, not a quick fix. You obviously have a strong drive and can work very hard, so your experience might be different, but I want to mention that healing can take a long time. Like, if it takes you an extra semester or year to graduate, that's fine in the long run, if it gets you healthy.

In particular, get healthy *before* you start grad school. Be stable and have a support plan in place for dealing with stress, including lack of drive like you're experiencing now. It's super common to lose motivation mid way through grad school, because your academic problems are bigger, harder, and less clearly defined. 

I love that you want to do math so much. It's great that you have a thing that you want to do (depression's good at hiding that from you). Protect that thing and keep it strong and healthy.

Do fun things, if you can. You've been under so much stress for so long. Go for a walk in the forest. Think about a beautiful proof while you're there.

You will make the impact you make - depending on where you settle you will make some impact but nobody starts work thinking that particular petri dish will get them the Nobel prize.

Figure out what you are interested in and find work in that - it will make an impact, but figuring out why enzyme X does y is just as important as figuring out which dose of drug z works best in schizophrenia. 

Everything is connected, everything makes an impact. You can make an impact by being a clinician and working with a person and making them feel better, you can make an impact by exploring psychological models, you can make an impact in a wet lab working on neurons or on drug activity, but it depends on what you want to do.

If you want to work in a lab and work on new compounds you can do that by taking pharmacology, if you are interested in neuronal behaviour in mental health do more neurology (beyond the field your neuro prof might work on), if you want to work clinically work towards a degree in clinical psychology (or go to med school and become a psychiatrist).

You are in your first year, you got time to work this out, to explore different things, to settle, to realize you settled wrong, to resettle, to get your graduate school degree, you start a job, to hate it, to find a new job, to love that one... you got all the time in the world.

Best bet is not to bring it up with anyone.

So this is something that I think could gain a lot of momentum, but there isn't a good way to do it right now. Journals are expensive, researchers aren't interested in training people outside academia and there really isn't any good way to easily filter out bad papers before an expert has to review them.

There are tons of reasons to not do academia apart from lacking the capacity: finances / horrible pay, location, can't find a suitable advisor, rampant mental health issues in the environment, etc. 

If no academics are willing to supervise, perhaps we can form communities of intelligent people, communicate and peer-review what we can. It seems like a fairly natural next step from accessible online education and the elimination of paywalls. Well managed communities are quite possible; many open source projects are extremely selective. 

Hobby doesn't mean part-time. Many people work far harder on their hobbies than their jobs. I think it would be extraordinarily difficult, but quite possible.

That said, if you feel your mental and/or physical health are at risk, then there's no shame in just withdrawing your poster. If you've already paid for the conference though, my guess is that you can't get that money back. ",2,2017-12-07 16:50:37,AskAcademia

dsxime1,TheAxeC,t2_k0j34,"It seems to be a bit too specific, but it could be molded into an interesting research question. If you want to study the effect of hijab on mental health, then you need to be aware of several aspects. 

I don't think I need to explain that this might be a sensitive topic, which does not make it less valid. However, this makes it quite important to remember to be objective. If you make a survey to send to people, you need to be wary that you don't let your own opinion flow into the survey. For example, you could make the survey in such a way that positive effects of the hijab aren't visible. 

Another important aspect is the correlation vs causation issue. Just because two elements are correlated doesn't mean that there is a causal relationship. 

Why do I say it's too specific? Because the hijab doen't exist in isolation. The hijab could be linked to religious reasons, cultural reasons or it could be a habit. Are the effects of the hijab always the same, do they vary depending on the reason for wearing it. Does culture influence the effects.  

As an example, you don't want to end up with the conclusion that ""hijabs have effect x on mental health"" when in actuality it's ""y has effect x on mental health and also causes people to wear hijabs"".

I just finished my 1st year of grad school, and I suffered from depression through most of it. Most of it was brought on by a break up (from my partner of 7 years) and the remarks/actions of my advisor at the time. So I switched advisors. 

I made the choice of opening up to my new advisor and telling her what I was suffering from and the reasons why (since it was mainly from the previous advisor). She was actually super supportive in the beginning. I thought whew! I can actually focus a bit more on my own mental health and getting better than always having to push through everything and push aside what I am going through. It really felt awesome to have my advisor on my side and care about the REAL me as opposed to just the ACADEMIC me, since you really do give so much of yourself to this academic/professional endeavor. 

I thought I was on my way to having a healthy relationship with my new advisor all summer until this week she said: ""I know I came off touchy feely but in the end, I am all about business.""

It bothered me so much. All I could think about was why is mental health treated like it doesnt fucking matter??? There are several other things that happened during the summer that greatly affected my ability to concentrate and work and just lead a productive life period, but it was all boiled down to that comment, and it hurt...a lot. 

So moral of the story? Don't tell your PIs/advisors. I learned the hard way. It is just safer that way. Talk to people who care and who actually understand what is going on and can actually help you through it (i.e. a professional counselor/therapist). And if it begins to affect your work, just get a doctor's note. PIs/Advisors understand that ""business exchange"" rather than you actually being honest about your limitations as a human being. 

She made it clear that she wasn't a counselor and wasn't meant to fit that role, and I totally get that. She is my advisor. I know. But since we have a close working relationship, I thought I could be real, but I guess not. It sucks....it really does. :/

f5gf7pz,restricteddata,t2_8brve,"To be charitable: the question the other person is really asking is, do you think you are ready to cope with a PhD program? There will be a lot of work, a lot of stress, far less support system than undergraduates tend to have, and it lasts a long time, which means there are a million ways in which your life can go sideways over that time. 

Almost everyone has had stuff stolen. It sucks. It can make one feel helpless, victimized, traumatized. Nobody doubts that. And most people's undergraduate years are a tempest of one sort of another. It's a tricky time of one's life. 

But this sort of thing will continue for the next 5-8 years in your life. Are you intellectually mature enough? This is a question you should ask yourself. (I do not know you, so I can't say. But you seem to blame all of your difficulties on external forces. This is generally _not_ a sign of maturity. You must take some serious responsibility for your own habits, issues, etc., if you are going to hope to overcome them.) 

This is a more important question than you GPA; if you are still prone to major difficulties with anxiety, commitment, whatever, then grad school is probably going to make these things _worse_, not better. Grad school is generally _harder_ than undergrad, except as much as you get to focus on what you enjoy more of the time. But the workload is higher, the responsibilities are higher, and there is a lot less room for excuses. Prioritize your mental health first. I generally recommend undergraduates have at least a year away from school (working in a job, etc.) to think about whether they really want to go back to school. Having that ""break"" can also help one mentally re-adjust from the undergrad to the grad mindset.

A one sentence explanation for red flag is all you need.

I would give some PhD programs a shot even with your current GRE scores.  You are probably not getting into Harvard with that, and I/O tends to be quantitative stats heavy, but having several publications as an undergrad is really going to help balance out the low quant score.  Also talk about your experience analyzing data and especially your stats (and stats software) skills you got from doing all of this research.  

If you apply to I/O PhD programs, tell them in the application that you plan to do academic research.

It's far more common than you'd think. The academic career is quite rough on the life part of life -- it's stressful, demanding, competitive; plagued by uncertainty about employment; subject to the schedule and rhythms of your pesky brain; underpaid; hard to evaluate own performance; and just for fun, you usually move (far!) every few years, ensuring that the little social life you've set up on the side gets swept under the carpet. In other words, extremely unhealthy, and the longer people have spent in that world, the more likely it is that they've either developed or discovered various mental illnesses in the process.

Faculty should be experienced enough to understand. Provided they're not socially inept/aloof/lost in their own world. Which happens, and that can get ouch. But if you're working for a somewhat functional human being, it shouldn't harm them to tell them you are having issues (don't get too emotional or detailed unless they care) and are working on them -- who knows, maybe they can even advise you on the subject.

dvzcmi3,barkupatree,t2_10zxnu,"I read your question and had to respond. Because I've been where you're at. In undergrad, I was sort of a ""black sheep."" I struggled with severe depression. I didn't really feel supported by or connected to any of my peers. Usually my professors wrote me off as an odd ball or slacker. I received poor grades. It was difficult because I was so excited about attending a university to expand my thinking, but instead I felt really shut down. 

However, when a topic really captivated me, I excelled. I threw myself into the class. Probably like you. I ended up working with two faculty who loved my passion and I assisted with their research. It even landed me a research job right out of undergrad. It's there when I realized that JUST because you are good at school, doesn't mean you're good at research. And vice versa. 

I'm now in a PhD program and I'm kicking butt. Pumping out writing, very self-directed, and getting wonderful feedback from faculty in my department. It's seriously not to brag, but looking back, if you told me 8 years ago - when I was suicidal and felt like a total idiot compared to my peers - that I would be considered a highly productive and intelligent PhD student, I would have laughed in your face. People with mental health challenges enter and complete PhD programs all the time. It's possible. People do it and some do more than complete it -- they excel, land faculty positions, and go on to make a difference in their fields.

But, as people have already said here, it's not easy. PhD programs are brutal -- lots of criticism, low resources and support, lots of isolation. If you're serious about this, here's my advice for you:

(1) Don't jump right into a PhD program. Take time off. Seriously. Work with your professor for pay for a year, if you can. Why? Because:

(2) In that year off, meet with your professor regularly to talk about research and writing. Learn the process. Learn how publishing works. Learn how people secure tenure. Learn about the future of jobs in your future area. Know what you're getting into.

(3) If you haven't already, find a therapist you love. Then work on your self-confidence. People who have low self-confidence get destroyed in PhD programs. I've seen it. Don't get cocky, obviously, but learn how to love yourself. Learn how to respond to criticism. Learn how to really take care of yourself. Pro-tip, especially if you're doing heavy theory work: criticisms  of your work can feel deeply personal, and you'll need to learn really healthy cognitive mechanisms to navigate it all.

(4) Do not discuss your mental health challenges with any faculty or future mentors. It is highly stigmatized. I've heard stories of search committees throwing away applications where people self-disclose. If you have other reasons that might explain a low GPA, you might consider BRIEFLY touching on it on an essay. Overall though, publications, research experience, a strong letter of recommendation: these can go very far. This also speaks to the importance of finding a therapist you can turn and vent to.

(5) When you enroll, register with the office for students with disabilities. Protect yourself with institutional resources. PhD programs will exacerbate issues. In the event that you need to take a semester off, you'll need people who can help you navigate policies and procedures.

Hope this is helpful! :)

Here is my advice: 

1. Really look into different program models and figure out what fits you and your interests best. EdD vs PhD, cohorts based, licensing for superintendency or principalship, etc. 

2. Don't be hesitant about asking about funding. You may need to be tactful about it, sure, but make sure you know financially what a PhD would entail. 

2.5. Don't be hesitant about your goals. Share your goals. See if your goals match the program. Do you want to have publications and a few presentations on your CV by graduation? What about your dissertation topic? How about your career aspirations? Don't go around demanding these things but be sure you and your advisor are on the same page about your professional development. 

3. Find faculty you would want to be your colleagues. Is the department toxic? Are the graduate students publishing and collaborating? Would you want to work there?

4. Have a secret contingency plan in case you need to bail (and don't feel bad for doing so if you need to!) Dropout rates of PhD programs are high because life happens, departments can suck, graduate students suffer mental health issues at very high rates, costs are high, graduate school is isolating, poverty sucks, etc.   For you that might mean making sure your graduate credit hours can apply to your teaching certification renewal.

dt9lc2p,AstraGlacialia,t2_ror2i,"In most (though not nearly all) chemistry labs, especially in the US and similar systems, the advisor doesn't take attendance. Typically you have individual and/or group meetings with the advisor every week or every few weeks, where you need to report what you have done in research since the last meeting, but you don't need to report daily. So, on the days when you don't need to teach or take classes and your presence isn't required for some practical reason (e.g., finishing a time-sensitive experiment or supervising an undergrad), you may come (or not come) and go as you please. Or you may need to tell just the people practically depending on you (e.g., the undergrad) but not the advisor. So, there will probably be more opportunities for ""mental health days"" (and time off to see a therapist during business hours) than in a non-academic chemistry job, especially if you can work weekends to make up for it (and don't choose a subfield/topic with experiments which need to be worked on every day). It may be unofficially noticed (and taken against you) if you are missing from the lab for two workdays in a row or if you are missing often, but an occasional day is likely to go unnoticed or tolerated if you do good work/ lots of work overall. Check the attendance policy before joining the lab by contacting the current PhD students.

On the other hand, most PhD advisors are indeed too busy (and unprepared and uninterested) for prolonged discussions about your mental and other personal issues. Supportive, kind and understanding ones can be found, but even then you may need to keep it brief or save such discussions for their rare less busy days. You may be able to talk more about it with your labmates, though it can also easily happen that all the more senior PhD students and postdocs in your lab are international and not fluent enough in English or culturally against personal discussions at work, or that they just don't like it. You may be more likely to get emotional support from the advisor (or a postdoc or another labmate) if you are willing to also give it to them proportionally, as a friend, though such friendships with supervisors can make PhD more emotionally difficult when research isn't going well (I have such a wonderful advisor so my failing experiments make me doubly sad because it means I am also disappointing him).",2,2018-01-26 10:35:15,AskAcademia

Just wanted to reassure you that you're not sunk yet, second year is still early days and quite frankly I didn't get seriously involved in research until around that point as well! The easiest way to get a leg in with professors is to 1) show interest in the class material, make sure you're getting help with the difficult concepts that are bringing your grades down and 2) get a feel for their area of research and see if that might be a good fit for you. The first step is to get some volunteering done with a lab - that'll set you up for your Bachelor's thesis, and maybe get you a supervisor for your M.A. if you decide to go that route.
As you commented earlier, yes you do have to first complete a Masters degree before pursuing a PhD in Canada (although I'm not sure if this is the case in Quebec, if that's where you are).

The only complaint that I ever hear about the field is the terminology it uses, which is often very flowery and/or can have connotations that laymen object to. For example, one of the key findings in positive psychology is the relationship between ""spirituality"" and better mental health outcomes. Many non-theists react negatively to this claim but it makes more sense when we look at how they're defining ""spirituality"", which is usually operationalised as something like ""belonging to a strong social support network"" or ""has an appreciation of something greater than themselves (like community or family)"" etc. 

As for Fredrickson's embarrassment - it was shitty science and it got called out. This happens in science all the time.

Be careful with that, though.  If you're thinking about declaring a major in astronomy or physics, those classes are almost certainly going to be prerequisites for higher-level classes.

du19eea,biggulpfiction,t2_l8i74,"Unfortunately, abusive PIs like yours are scarily common. I'm deeply sorry you had to go through all of that. My PI is one of the best mentors in the department and still has tendency towards acting in ways you described, and that's hard enough on me as is -- I don't know how people do it. For people who don't know what this can be like, if you've seen the movie Whiplash, when I saw that I was like ""wow this is like grad school.""

That being said, I think people who want to go into academia need to be informed/warned that it is more akin to becoming a professional athlete or artist. You can spend a very long time at it and still not be one of the best. It's not an effort model, it's a talent model. We don't have the same outrage that someone can devote their entire childhood and young adult life to being a baseball player, to get not make the major leagues, and get stuck in the minors, or quit, or have to leave due to an injury. We understand that that is a job that almost no one gets and that you take that risk if you try to get it.

For better or worse, academia just isn't comparable to other more conventional job paths. I'm not saying this as a justification, that it's good that it is this way. But I think people are misinformed going in about the potential outcomes. I also think people misunderstand how much they need to be obsessed with their work to be one of the ones who makes it, and to like it even if they make it in spite of this. (That doesn't mean you ALWAYS have to feel this way, everyone has fluctuations.)

I think what anyone looking into a career should know the following (CAVEAT: I am familiar with the U.S system only):    

* NEVER EVER EVER PAY FOR GRAD SCHOOL. If you have to pay for grad school (with the exception of professional degrees), you're already, ability aside, almost by definition not going to be someone that gets a stable academic job     
* Think about what you would do if not grad school. If the questions you want to research in grad school aren't questions (or similar to questions) that you'd be still wondering about in another career (in job or your free time), it may be hard to drum up the internal motivation necessary to get through grad school.     
* If you aren't sure if grad school is for you, get more experience as a lab manager or research assistant. When these jobs pay, they typically pay better than the grad student stipend, and you will become acquainted with the academic culture in your field.     
* Use extreme discretion when choosing a school/lab/PI. If you get into one school and the PI seems like an abusive asshole, don't go. You're better off reapplying because if you go, things will be infinitely harder than they need to be. 
* Related to above, get as much information as you possibly can from the grad students/lab managers etc while you're on an interview.     
* Many go into grad school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. This is good! It's good to be passionate and excited. But have an exit plan and don't be ashamed of the exit plan. Academia is not for everyone and sometimes you can't know that until you're in it. Be aware that that is a possible outcome.     
* Don't sacrifice mental health. Grad school is a marathon, not a sprint (although it can feel like a sprinting marathon). Take a leave of absence if you need to. Your work will be infinitely better and easier when your own health is taken care of. It's important to prioritize yourself, not just for self-care type reasons, but also because it actually makes you more productive and do better work.     
* Develop generalizable skills (programming, statistics) while you're in your program. Data science is booming, and even if you're sure you want to stay in academia, it is reassuring to know you have options, and it makes you more confident in yourself and your work when you know you have skills that are sought after",2,2018-02-10 14:11:44,AskAcademia
dfkle1h,math-kat,t2_14rxa3,"I had a similar experience as well with my undergrad adviser.  I never cut so my mental health issues aren't visible from the outside, and for most of my undergrad I keep a lot of it hidden.  One semester was really rough on me- I had to drop down to the bare minimum number of classes, stop research entirely, and still was struggling to keep up with my schoolwork.  I'd meet with my adviser every week, and every week he'd get angry at me for not trying hard enough and slacking off.

Admin definitely seems like the way to go based on how I operate (the conscientious/somewhat neurotic type). I have applied to NGO's, health care firms, etc., but it is indeed time to go back through the organizations I've already applied to with a fresh cover letter and CV.

I think you're right that I've been limiting my options to more ""reach"" organizations (Harvard, BU, Tufts, Suffolk, Brandeis...), but--following your advice to do something desirable--I am definitely, 100% more motivated to work within an academic institution conferring degrees and organizing cohorts/events/speakers/scholarships than, well, somewhat more drab options. I mentioned both MBA and JD programs, and while actually registering for the GMAT/LSAT and preparing motivation statements for those programs is a long, long way off, I would be very interested in working in those programs from within on the admin side of things.

The graduate degree: earliest entry is likely 2019, which I may well go for, but considering my interests in terms of which degree to ultimately pursue are wildly varied, I would be more content with securing employment and possibly looking into night classes to bolster the skills where I am most lacking (quant, specifically) and help settle requirements for grad programs of interest while re-establishing credibility.

1. Speak with your potential supervisor and ask him about culture of the lab

2. Speak with other students past and present (past students would give more honest feedback but may be hard to track down) 

3. If things are not working out with your supervisor speak with the university support and consider changing. It’s much easier to change early in your PhD than after 3 years. 

4. Don’t stress so much. Good scientists aren’t exactly good managers and bosses. So take what they say with a grain of salt. 
 (My supervisor told me the other day that I don’t have enough for a PhD, what he means is “I want to stress you out so that you work harder and faster and stay focused”)

5. Speak with other students, try make friends. Can be helpful to have people who have been through it and can give advice and wisdom.

No, you do not need to minor in anything.  Minor tends to just mean, 'I had enough of an interest in something to pursue it somewhat'
For example I studied anthro and minored in Bio because I thought it was cool.  Because I took the minor and not the major, I was exempt from taking calculus and O chem and whatever else came with hard science (I consider this to be a bit of a downfall, but besides the point).  It really has no bearing on my career path or my ability to produce research.  I thought Bio was cool and complimented my major, so I went for it.  
Double majors are a bit more lucrative, on the other hand.  My sister got a double major in finance and philosophy, because good luck getting a job with a philosophy degree.  That would open up a lot more doors.

That being said, it’s so important to establish a good work and life balance early on. It’s good to be enthusiastic about your work, but if you don’t take time to relax after working 10 hour days (or more) you won’t be able to continue that kind of work for long. I find that spending time with lab members outside of work is a great way to unwind because they can also relate to the daily stresses that you’re going through. Plus, it helps to establish great relationships with the people that you’ll spend most of your time with.

So yes, it’s normal to feel totally exhausted on a daily or weekly basis, just make sure you take a couple hours a day to just do something that you don’t need to use a ton of brainpower for, or something that you enjoy. Also, I’ve more recently found that forcing exercise into my routine in the morning is a great habit to get into. Even if it’s 30min sessions a day, it’s an easy and non-time consuming way to blow off steam and boost your confidence.

Additionally, I see a school mental health counselor biweekly as a preventative measure. Most grad student do develop mental health problems and many of them end up quitting because of it. Staying ahead of your mental health by seeing a therapist is a smart thing to do, even if you don’t feel like you need to do it, I highly recommend this.

&gt;The ideology of the republican party seems to essentially be that if it requires public spending and it isn't the military then it is eventually surplus to requirements. They don't really care if you're creating jobs if you're creating jobs by using public funds.

That seems to be at least partly true wrt the GOP. Two additional considerations would be that 1. I don’t consider President Trump to be a Republican in the classic mold of the GOP, and that’s great 2. I’d prefer that my job existed in the private sector sans government funding, but that’s a tough sell for prevention research because it’s so difficult to monetize results. I do bring in a lot of donor money and some pharmacy funds for software development, so although I can’t really practice science in an Atlas Shrugged sort of way, I do try to be diverse in my funding streams. 

&gt;If this administration thought that a private entity could achieve the things your doing with public money wouldn't you just be cut loose?

Yes, and I should be. But then I’d go work for that private entity. 

&gt;Also if they are really concerned about health improvement why are they trying to roll back any progress towards a universal healthcare system that is clearly effective in many other countries? It seems only health improvement for the select few is important. The US has, I think, the highest healthcare spending in the world but doesn't provide adequate healthcare to significant portions of the population, something doesn't add up there?

This is pretty loaded so I’ll just say that the US spends the most on healthcare but also (hear me out here) has unequivocally the best medical treatments in the world. The disparity in results across countries, where the US does indeed lag behind, is primarily due to deficiencies in healthcare delivery and in prevention efforts. If Spaniards ate the same diet that Americans did and got similar amounts of physical activity, Spain would almost certainly have worse health outcomes than America currently has. Our medical system has weaknesses - especially in delivery, but by in large, it is superb. Health promotion and a culture of healthful living is, however, a complete train wreck in the US. 

&gt;I'm always confused as to what the phrase make America great again actually means, what time period is it actually referring to? A lot of American history is pretty grim reading...

It’s a slogan, it’s catchy, and I wouldn’t suggest investing too much mental energy in it. However, a little mental energy is probably okay and I think it mostly refers to American trajectory. 2015 was the first period in modern polling history in which a majority of Americans felt that the next ten years would be worse, not better than, the previous ten years. So MAGA seems more to be about making America ascendant than “great again” relative to some non-arbitrary timepoint. 

And yes, history is pretty grim but I am not willing to concede that American history is any more grim than the history of other period-matched nation-states. Japanese-American internment during WWII was awful, but at the same time in history there was a systematic attempt in Europe to exterminate a race of people and, simulataneously, Japan was raiding the shores of China and Korea to capture sex slaves for their military personnel. Slavery was horrific, but it was horrific throughout the world throughout history, and America fought a war largely for the purpose of bringing the practice to an end. The Kent State shooting was horrible, but it was part of a larger context in Vietnam that eventually led to America winning the Cold War, stabilizing nuclear relations, and halting the spread of communism. So to me, American history is fantastic and inspirational, despite having many blemishes that should best be utilized to educate us in our pursuit of future betterment.",2,2018-07-25 18:52:11,AskAcademia
d8apc13,CornCobbDouglas,t2_nkhui,"1) let's say there is a known deterrence effect. That doesn't justify it because we still must contend with the ethics and morals of having state sanctioned murder. 

2) let's say there is known deterrence effect. We still must compare that to other forms of deterrence, such as life incarceration. Does the death penalty deter more than life in prison? 

3) let's say there is known deterrence effect, we still must contend with the additional costs of imposing the death penalty versus incarceration. 

4) let's say there is known deterrence effect. We still must contend with the systemic causes that lead to those murders like poverty, drug abuse and mental health. 

5) there is a great difficulty in establishing causality. Econometricians are only able to use natural experiments to statistically disentangle deterrence effects from other changes. Some show a significant effect, some don't depending on the econometric model and data looked at.

On the other side, deterrence is not the sole reason for criminal sanctions. We also use sanctions for distributing justice (subjectively defined of course), incapacitation, and even base reasons of proportionality of crime and punishment. I can imagine many of societies that might employ capital punishment not to deter others but because it is what fits with their sense of justice.

Do not ask your professor ""what did I miss"" - ask other students in the class. You can definitely ask questions about reading and show that you are interested in the topic, but I suggest coming with some of your thoughts on the reading to show that you did the reading. 

&gt; but I don't know how to go about explaining my absence. I'm tempted to just lie and say I've had the flu/fever, but who is sick for four weeks straight? 

Did you really miss four weeks of class? If you have documentation about the flu, you should give it to him. Even if you have a confirmation of going to a doctor or a prescription for flu medication (?) rather than a doctors note, that is better than nothing. 

&gt; Should I be honest and tell him the real reason why I missed the last two classes?

I would. Explain that you have been dealing with overwhelming mental health problems (you can literally just say ""overwhelming mental health problems"") but, most importantly, that you have been looking into ways to get help with those issues. *This is the key!* If you don't explain that you have been trying to get help then it will be harder for the prof to accept as reasonable, and you will not seem responsible.

dexstj2,emailanimal,t2_mkohp,"What /u/FG10 says is only part of the deal. It is a start. Anyone with a mental health issue needs to get treatment first and foremost, and if they are not getting it, the first thing to do is refer them there.

Having said that, if this is your Ph.D. or MS student, things unfortunately do not stop there.  I've had multiple experiences, both somewhat successful and somewhat unsuccessful.  

First and foremost, rule number 1 is student's health over just about anything else.  

Second, figure out, if anything related to their work with you is a cause of concern. Sometimes it is, because there are deadlines, stress, etc.  If this is the case, remove as much stress as you can.  Sometimes it is the other way around: the work the student is doing is actually what helps them. This needs to be understood.

Third, figure out what the plan is. Does the student feel able to continue work? Does the student need to take time off? Does the student need a change of topic/change of approach to work?  Figure it out and adjust accordingly.\

The bad news is that sometimes the right thing to do is for the student to stop working on the project and drop out of school to deal with their health. Sometimes the student needs to start working on something else.  Sometimes they are very close to completion when this happens, and it is really painful to see good work go away.

I had a weekend long panic attack before my husband begged me to take a break, and I almost lost my marriage. 

Luckily, my advisor is also great. It took me having a total breakdown to see it.

It took a semester for me to get past more guilt and to realize that I need time to figure out if the PhD is right for me and, ultimately figure out what I want to do for the rest of my life. I did a stint in an intensive outpatient mental health program and started my mental health leave of absence this summer.

I don't mean to rant, but I wanted to explain that I know first hand how rough it can be financially and emotionally when this drags on longer than planned. 

If your husband is still at it after 5 years, it must be something he truly wants, so he should keep at it! PhD's are really tough in the sense that if you don't complete it and defend that finished end product, you'll have ""nothing"" to show for all your hard work and effort. One day you are nothing, and the next day after the viva you have a PhD and the world is your oyster.... this can stress the hell out of any human being. Your husband will just have to try to keep his eyes on the prize and hang in there until the end!

My partner's support was invaluable during this period, and I really truly could not have persevered without it. When your husband expresses guilt about your situation, remind him that you two are a team and that there will surely come a time when he will be carrying the heaviest work load. The best you can do is to continue to be there for him, support him, and try to make sure he isn't thinking about work when he shouldn't be!

If there are any opportunities to connect with other PhD students he should really do this, as talking to people who are in the same boat is very helpful. After all, they know exactly what it is like. It might also be helpful to make use of any mental health support available in order to try to get a perspective on things. I didn't do this, but I really, really, really should have.

I understand this feeling. I'm living it right now. Lets just get through it and wrap up the degree. Survive and advance. One foot in front of the other. Survive and advance. I'm thinking about getting that tattooed on my shoulder. 

I think the advice that you are getting, while well intentioned, is responding to something that isn't the problem. From what you are saying, I believe that the problem is that ""Programming used to be so much fun, now it feels like just an obligation that needs to be done"". Graduate school is actively taking something you loved and making you hate it. I don't think the solution to grit your teeth and just keep doing the same thing. What happens if you come out of grad school hating programming? That's your career!

I can't guarantee that the mental health services on campus will help (they exist and they're probably free). There are good counselors and bad counselors just like there are good programmers and bad programmers. I can assure you that no halfway decent trained mental health professional would ever tell you to grit your teeth and get it done. Doing the same thing and hoping for different results is literally insanity. They'll listen, they'll think, they'll put your feelings into words, they'll discuss strategies and, yeah, they'll make you think about whether this is the right fit for you *right now*. It might not be. 

My situation is different from yours - different degrees, different life paths, different everything. But I came out of a shitty situation to go to grad school and grad school didn't magically fix anything. There's a chance you'll come out of grad school and get a first job and your mental health will still be an issue - jobs aren't magic buttons. The grass might be green on the other side, but the easiest way to guarantee that is by watering it - otherwise, you're waving a rain stick and praying for rain.

d1ive34,ronco_2015,,"&gt;Do you firmly believe that I am way overthinking about both situations? (The unintentional one and the intentional one)

Yes, I do.

In the grand scheme of things, those are both water under the bridge. They appear to indicate lapses in judgment, not serious character flaws.

&gt;Regardless of my mental health, do you think I should act upon my urge and confess to the instructors?

I absolutely do not. There's nothing to be gained from it. It does nothing but damage you in their eyes, and regardless of whatever the degree of your condition is, your future is more important than confessing something that, at this point, is almost completely meaningless.

Rather than using it to sabotage your future, use your awareness of those experiences to condition how you move forward.

Also, keep in mind that what you're dealing with here is a mental condition, not something externally imposed. People suffering from the type of OCD you're talking about are not *actually* more ""moral"" than other people. But they *do* tend to more mentally inflexible when it comes to what they *perceive* as morality.

You really need to find some kind of mental health professional to talk to. If you're in another nation other than the US, perhaps you have access to better health care than we do here, and can find a professional outside a campus setting to speak to.

Obsessively (no joke intended) analyzing your past behavior to find things to nitpick will get you nowhere. Remember that what you're dealing with is feelings stemming from your condition, and *not* likely anything that anyone else even cares about.",2,2016-03-30 09:44:07,AskAcademia

My opinion on this is that you would benefit from taking your own mental health more seriously. It is unique to you and you need unique support with it. 

If someone has agoraphobia and panics each time they leave the house do you think it makes any difference that other people can leave the house without issue? Why would comparing them to other people mean anything? Would you tell this person ""you should be able to leave the house and telling us you can't is a great disrespect to everyone who doesn't struggle with this?""

IMO during a PhD your number 1 job is looking after your own mental health. Psychological problems were, by far, the biggest problem I had in my PhD and that my friends had while doing theirs. They are always a widely reported problem.

There is no shame in taking time off and going at a slower pace. You are a high achiever and so it can feel like if you are anything other than perfect everyone will come down hard on you.

clk2pr9,afxz,t2_afkld,"I'm going to be brief here because it seems like this line of questioning is very du jour:

- There isn't very much room in academia for *anyone*. Let's just make this abundantly clear, first and foremost. It is not a gentle, safe haven for quiet introverts and sensitive, scholarly souls. Academia is more competitive than law. As a life choice, it's a bigger time and resource investment than law school or an MBA. It is fiercely competitive by nature and there will be metric tonnes of stress on every individual to produce research, get the best teaching appraisals, out-do his/her peers by winning prizes, grants, scholarships &amp;c. (I know the sciences have a more collaborative ethos than the arts and humanities, due to the group nature of many research projects, but still: internecine squabbling is there).

- Imposter Syndrome is becoming a banal cliché. Everyone I speak to has Imposter Syndrome nowadays. It's the new medically diagnosed 'suffering from stress'. It's the new depression/anxiety SSRI bonanza. Don't put too much stock in these vague diagnoses - many people use them as a crutch and just spend their years at graduate school wallowing in the campus counsellor's office, popping pills they probably don't need to try and surmount some self-invented mental bar, all the while stuck in a nasty feedback loop with their own, self-furthering misery. What I will say, whether it is a consequence of the competitive environment or solitary lifestyle, or whether the sort of people entering grad school are predisposed - which is one for the health professionals - incidences of mental health problems in graduate school are sky-high. Everyone has a complex or a neurosis. Imposter Syndrome is just the latest one in a long line to acquire a sort of zeitgeist'y 'trend' factor. Sorry if this sounds overly cynical, and I know many people do suffer genuine horrors. But universities are full of people who are ""just so passionate"" but also 'just so...' shackled by their emotional and mental hang-ups.  

My best advice is to stop over-thinking things (if it's possible for an academic). The sad reality that much of the feel-good rhetoric and encouragement around here elides is that, for many, graduate school is the better part of a decade spent in self-inflicted psychic turmoil that leads to no job. I'd think about that: it almost seems masochistic at times. You need to find some way to be content and happy before launching yourself at this intellectual crucible. To that end, I would recommend the panacea that others have touched upon before: realising that *everyone* is equally as clueless as you.

dztqqz0,hhd411wild,t2_aic58,"I agreed w/ u/Jake_JAM about deciding which direction you see yourself take after completing your degree. I was on track to continue with my PhD; but decided to settle with a masters for two reasons. One, I didn’t like the environment where I studied. This institution provides the latest instrumentations for me to do research and I received hands on training from the field engineers on operating the instruments. The school provides technical trainings for me to learn as a researcher which I mastered during my masters program. Two, I didn’t enjoy working with individuals at this program. It had too much of academia politics that was very toxic for my mental health. Originally, I wanted to work in the pharmaceutical field and eventually lead the lab as I progress through my career. PhDs in chemistry and pharmaceutical sciences make about 60k plus after they finish their degrees. Some other fields such as the food industry (which I switched over) makes the same and often more with a masters. After working in the mid size generic pharma, I realized I had to start from the bottom as Chemist I with a masters or a PhD for a shitty low salary. This is very typical for those who work in pharma. Industry cares more about industry experiences than academia works. I had mentors who told me that low salaries for entry level positions for masters and PhDs in pharma had to do with the lack of experiences in QC and gov regulatory compliances. Currently, the trend in the science industry (pharmaceutical and food industries) focuses on both technical and business experiences. This is where having both MS and MBA is highly desirable than having a Ph.D solely. The core of pursuing a PhD should always be about science and not profits. I know a few PhD students who are on track to graduate within the next two years expect six figures salary when they accept their first job in the industry. This view is wrong and you shouldn’t based on this desire to get a PhD. 

Last comment: student loans was another reasons why I left academia and started working. I don’t want to be paying my student loans in my late 40s. I want to start my own business and pay off these debts as quickly as possible. ",2,2018-05-30 15:19:06,AskAcademia

You will also want to talk about possible accommodations the college can provide for your mental health problems (it will depend, but could include things like extra time on assignments or taking tests in a quiet testing center, etc.).  Colleges are usually better equipped to assist students struggling with mental health problem now.  If you are picking between colleges, the one with the better support services should be your deciding factor. 

If you have been out of school for a bit, you may want to dip your toes into a community college first.  All degrees (from accounting to zoology) have common course requirements (things like take 2 histories, 2 sciences, 2 writing, etc.).  You can pick these up at a community college for less money and probably less stress.  Once again, you want to see what kind of support services they offer.

I was the same way. I was ranked 2nd in my class and was shooting for valedictorian and Ivy league admissions. My grades plummeted and there was no chance that'd be a realty. My entire identity revolved around my grades and how ""smart"" I was. I had managed to convince myself that I wasn't smart anymore-- that I was worthless. All because of a low gpa. For years I walked around thinking I was stupid and incapable. The reality was that this wasn't true. I am still smart, and so are you. They may be able to take away your gpa, but they can never take away your knowledge. 

&gt;  my chances at med school are over now. 

It may feel like this is the case right now, but I wouldn't write it off so soon. I think you have a chance, especially as someone who didn't actually cheat. As I've been saying, you are who you are, and nothing's going to change that. Medical school admissions really do want to know about you, not about the fake you that is reflected in the records. You are going to need to take the time to process what happened. I do 100% believe that the experience you've had will make you a better doctor. I also know that it will be a more challenging route to success. It might take longer. But assuming that you are otherwise well qualified and motivated, I suspect that it is not out of the question for you to be admitted to a medical school. 

Please don't be hesitate to speak to a mental health professional. What you've been through is very hard to deal with.

They may have counseling, DBT therapists, DBT group therapy meetings (I didn’t like the idea of this but it turned out to be extremely helpful), or other mental health treatments. Also, you don’t have to put your whole life on hold to do an intensive treatment program as there are many ways to do DBT or other treatments. One of your first steps is to see a doctor about depression. You could even print this post out and show them (the bolding posted by another user will make it pretty clear). Figuring out treatment with a specific outcome/goal was a big step for me that I put off for a long time and took a lot of effort to get myself to actually do, partially because it’s scary and so much seemed to be overwhelming at the time. If you find yourself stuck, please DM me and I will help as much as I can. Good luck and feel better. ",2,2018-11-10 09:59:33,AskAcademia
e982z1k,petronia1,t2_11zx1z,"I think it's so wonderful and inspiring, that you want to be a librarian! I think so few people choose this career anymore, and it's such a shame. I believe the best way you can go about this is set a realistic list of goals fitting the requirements you know you will meet in your studies preparing for this career.   
So, the basic line of questioning would be:

\- what schools that offer programs suitable to this career are accessible to you? (Factoring in location, costs, GPA and other academic requirements)

\- where are you, from an academic standpoint, relative to those requirements? Do you have some covered, are there some that you still need to work towards? If the latter, are your targets reachable, reasonably speaking? (For example, do you have all the credits you need to graduate, does your GPA qualify you for these programs, is there something more you could do to boost your scores, in the time that you have left?)  
\- when it comes to what you perceive as weak points (gap years), focus less on explaining those, but do try to come up with a short sentence that you feel best expresses your reality, in case someone asks. (""Yes, there are some gap years during which I did various things, but I never stopped really wanting this for myself and I am in a point to pursue it now"", or something like that). Focus on what you have been doing in that time, especially since it seems you did do some cool things, including some related to the field you're interested in. Focus on that, talk about that the most. That proves you can already do the job, sort of, and with less education in the field than you would have after finishing your grad school. So grad school would only make you even better at that job.  


And most of all, focus on the fact that you do no owe anyone any explanation for your mental health. I don't think you even have to be specific about it. ""Personal health reasons"" may suffice. Looks like you can already show commitment to this path, so focus on getting them to see what a great candidate that makes you (""them"" being the admission committees of schools you have a realistic chance of entry into).  


Best of luck, this is a wonderful thing you are trying to do, and I hope you succeed. ",2,2018-11-07 13:28:35,AskAcademia
d5guij9,AstraGlacialia,t2_ror2i,"I have a friend who seems similar to that (very smart and decent grades but deeply affected by depression and anxiety and other mental issues - including having been hospitalized/in intensive therapy for a year prior to her master's, but stable enough during it - and much better at organizing her thoughts in writing than at speaking... though she doesn't seem really shy). She has been a teacher for almost a year, she seems to enjoy it and successful at it, I have an impression it's good for her and for her students so far. It (at least currently) looks better than her other options, as research in her country is in very poor state so it is in most cases stressful, unpleasant and dead-end to be a PhD student there, she can't go to another country because of access to mental health therapy, and industry jobs in her field tend to be too unhealthy, physically and mentally difficult for her (very long working hours and commutes).

I think you should talk with the student about why she wants to become a teacher, what are her alternative career options, and how is she planning to overcome her challenges associated with teaching. Do your best to be honest but not intimidating or discouraging. If you after that decide to write the letter, I agree that you most likely should honestly write about the positive attributes and omit the negative ones without lying - but it would be safer that you consult with a more experienced colleague in your country, as ""unwritten rules"" for recommendation letters vary widely.",2,2016-07-18 14:55:16,AskAcademia

cw0gevm,manova,t2_35w8d,"My basic outline is:

* What are your professional goals?
* How will this program help you reach those goals?
* What will you bring to this program?

Tell them why you want a PhD, in terms of what your life goals are (want to be a professor, work R&amp;D in industry, etc.).  What have you been doing already to put you on this path.  You should not be indecisive, even if you are still figuring things out.  Your letter should reflect laser focus on a life goal.

What about this program will help you meet these goals?  What professor do you plan to work with?  Mention this up top, my old grad advisor was the program director and he organized the review of applications.  He said he read the first paragraph to see which professor the application for was and then forwarded it to the appropriate professor.  He said if he could not tell who it was for, he would just leave it in a stack and bring the stack to the meeting and ask if anyone wanted to look through the stack for other potential students.  Of course, by that point, each professor often had their choices picked out from the applications that they had already reviewed.  I don't know if others do something similar, but I see nothing wrong with starting your letter with something like I am applying for the PhD program in XXX and hope specialize in YYY working in the laboratories of either Dr. ZZZ or AAA.  

There will probably be other aspects of the program that you will want to mention, such as other potential collaborations (your future committee members), the laboratory facilities, special equipment, special access to research populations/models, track record of previous students, or whatever.  

Then you want to talk about your experience.  What research skills do you have, what projects have you worked on, etc.?

Do not give personal stories.  Nothing about how your great aunt died of alzheimer's and this lead you to want to study brain mechanisms of memory.  If you need to address a red flag in your application, do not dwell on it, or overly apologize for it, mention it an move on (e.g., my GPA is low, but during my initial year in college, I lacked focus.  However, I was able to refocus my efforts in XXX and my GPA within my major is YYY.  My research experience...etc).  Do not reveal a mental health problem.  If you do have one or had to take a break from school because of one, just refer to it as a health problem that is now resolved (there is just prejudice against mental health issues).  Only mention a health problem if you need it to explain a red flag (one semester GPA was bad, took a semester off, now all better).  One or two sentences to cover a red flag is enough to give them a reason/justification but recognition that you are ready to move on.  Keep it under 2 pages double spaced, but longer than 1 page (unless there is a specific word count given).

Undergrads: first I screen by GPA/transcripts and then time commitment (at least 10 hours a week). I used to give more a shot but I get so many requests and so few actually carry through. My secondary screen is a few questions about expectations, career goals (no wrong answer, just want to know how to advise them) and schedule. Finally an ""interview"". I give feedback at every point. 

Masters Students: they are free so I have generally given them a lot of leeway. It's competitive to get one, there were only 5 for 15 open slots. But these have been a mixed bag for me. My first three masters students have been varying levels of disasters. One did enough to get a paper but didn't finish for mental health reasons, another was quite bright but extremely high strung. The third can't pass his classes or multitask in any way. I now have a rule that I will vet masters students as carefully as PhD. 

PhD: a lot of this depends on funding and timing. I've been told you'll spend 90% of the time on your lowest performers in the lab. This has definitely been true for the masters students. Right now I'm feeling out my first PhD student. I expect a lot from them because that's what's required. But it's been a struggle to pull them from the UG mentality to the PhD student mentality. 

My philosophy is to tell the students that unless they are self-starters, self-motivated they shouldn't be in my lab. But this strategy hasn't been working so well lately. I often find myself alone in the lab, they leave early, come in late. I'm trying to change that culture now. I've finally gotten two of the disruptive MS students out (one graduated the other a leave of absence), but we're not making much progress.

My general opinion on mental issues is that you cannot help someone who does not want to be helped. If the person experiencing depression/anxiety does not seek help, all the solutions in the world will not help them. 

My university seems like it has a lot of resources for people who want help. There is a counseling center, they send out regular emails during semesters to get people to reach out, join support groups, etc., and there's always health newsletters flyers etc addressing this issue. I don't know what more can possibly be done here. For the type of person that will seek help, there is a very clear path to it with frequent reminders that it's normal and they're not alone. 

Ok now is the part that I haven't experienced but hear over and over again: People who went to counseling centers say that it was no help to them at all. The people there were overworked, overbooked, not fully able to deal with the problems of the student, and in some cases there is apparently a limit on how many times you can go in one semester, don't know if that's the case for our school.

Make sure you and your advisor come to an early understanding about your expectations of each other. Learn what your advisor expects of you as a student with regards to work output and time commitment, and ask them what you can expect of them as an advisor. If they have seemingly unrealistic expectations, it's likely that you'll be able to manage them effectively without overworking yourself. 

Codify work hours and stick to them. Grad school is a job. Once you've put in your hours for the day, stop work and go be a person. Working more hours does not mean you produce better work, in fact research shows the opposite is true.

Take weekends off.

There will be exceptions to the above, of course, for example your advisor might need a few paragraphs for a proposal, you may have a deadline suddenly change, or your experiment stopped working one week before a conference. There will be times when you need to crunch in a heroic effort in a short amount of time. Once you push through these times, take a three-day weekend. 

The Pomodoro method and instrumental music work wonders for productivity, as long as you respect the breaks. Read up on this method and you'll understand what I mean. 

Have an exercise routine, even if it's just walking around the block three times a week. You don't need to get swole, you just need to stay active.

Eat well. Drink water. I mean it. 

Talk to people as often as you can, especially during pandemic times. I used to dread lab meetings, but now it's a time to catch up with friends. If your meetings are all ""camera on"", put on some nice clothes. 

Get a good ergonomic chair and do your work at a desk. Don't just slump into the couch with a laptop for 8 hours a day, you'll wreck your back. 

It's okay to take a mental health day once in a while. You don't even have to take a full day off.

A day wasn't wasted as long as you accomplish *something*. Anything like ""I responded to emails"" or ""I gathered the papers I need to read this week"" are good, actionable tasks that you could check off from a list.

If you make to-do lists for work, make them achievable and detailed. Don't put ""write journal article"", instead break it down into the individual steps required. You'll get to tick off more boxes as you go, and it'll be more satisfying to progress. 

Make to-do lists for real life, too.

Multiply your predicted time frame for any deliverable by 3.

Network, and take advantage of any career resources your university offers. Make connections that will serve you well when you graduate. I've seen several colleagues go through their PhD staying laser focused on work, and when they graduate, they have a useless piece of paper and no leads on a job. 

Pick up a hobby that requires some sort of investment. I know money is tight as a grad student, but by investing money into something, you'll naturally want to spend more time with it.

Other helpful responses have already been posted, so I just wanted to address two specific points:

**1)** I understand your relationship with your advisor is complex, and I agree that their behavior towards your peer was transphobic (whether intentional or not). Nevertheless, you haven't described any confrontations or instances of manipulation/abuse in your own relationship with her. All you've said is that she hasn't shown interest in your mental health.

While I do think faculty should have deep empathy for their students and remember that they exist outside of the classroom/lab, we're not mental health professionals. It's important that certain boundaries be maintained, and this is one of them. It definitely sounds like she's too far in the wrong direction! But it also doesn't sound like she's actively judging you for expressing your change in directions. **So, I strongly encourage you to ask for a recommendation.** She won't offer, because that simply isn't how this particular social contract works. Most of us are happy to write for students, because we want the best for them, **but we're never going to offer to assign ourselves more work.**

*This is a professional relationship between two adults.* If you want a letter, you request one, and then she'll provide it. Don't let your anxiety drive your decision-making. It sounds like you're either **A)** trying to displace the discomfort of asking onto her and **B)** expecting her to read your mind. If she's not deeply involved in your professional/personal life and you don't ask for a recommendation, she could easily assume that you cultivated a relationship with some other faculty member you thought was more appropriate to ask.

**2) You should not, under any circumstance, ""be open about my failed professional relationship with my advisor.""** First, it will only make you look unprofessional. Second, there's no way for us to verify what you say (and while we may know your colleague, we don't you). Third, it is irrelevant to why you want to make this professional change.

The point of a statement of purpose/research statement is to explain, using concise language and specific examples, what you want to achieve, how you're going to achieve it, why you want to achieve it, why this is the right program/department, etc. ***You should never use precious real estate to discuss anything other than yourself,*** your goals, your project, your strengths, your weaknesses, your capacity for growth, your resilience, etc. You could potentially **briefly** mention your friend, since their death is clearly part of the impetus for change here.

gd8e2z4,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"First of all, it sounds like you are feeling a lot of distress right now. While finishing up a dissertation is known for being challenging in general, we are in the middle of a pandemic, and it sounds like longstanding mental health challenges or imposter syndrome feelings may be contributing to your feeling of being overwhelmed, as well.

On a very practical level, here are some tips that I have:

1. Communicate and be transparent with your advisor, if you have not already done so. Hopefully, as an advisor, they have a sense of how far along you are in your writing. But if they don't, let them know where you're at and what you're struggling with, and work together to develop a game plan for moving forward. Helping you across the finish line with this challenging process is quite literally part of their job as an advisor.

2. There's a piece I've turned to myself and recommended for students regarding writers block called Shitty First Drafts: https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf. At this point in time, focus on just getting any words on paper. Pay no attention to how good your writing is and spend no time editing this initial draft as you write it; there will be an opportunity to make revisions later. First drafts of something as big as a dissertation will always benefit from substantial revisions. But by just getting words down, you've accomplished what can be the hardest part: you have *something* that can be submitted, and then you can focus your efforts on improving it with the remaining time you have, rather than wondering if you'll be able to write anything at all.

3. Chunk your writing. Sitting down to decide ""how am I going to write this 25,000 word behemoth"" sounds overwhelming. Select a small portion of your dissertation you feel most confident about and start there. Decide on other chunks that are small portions of your dissertation you can write a first draft of in a reasonable amount of time (e.g., a few hours, or a day).

4. How much time do you have left? For example, if you need to submit your dissertation by the end of the fall semester, that's quite soon. But if you defend sometime in the spring semester, you both have a lot of work left to do but also some time to do it. Getting organized now and communicating with your advisor will help. I'll also add that it's okay to extend your program if you feel like you need to--we're in the middle of an ongoing crisis that affects people's ability to get work done, and it's okay if you find that you need more time.

I think it's totally appropriate to ask students if they are doing okay if you are concerned and also to help get students connected to resources. While the university counseling center is by far the easiest option (because we have on-call/drop-in services, in non-COVID times I could even physically walk them to a therapist and do a warm handoff if they are currently in crisis), I am happy to walk students through the process of seeking alternative help if they request it because I have expertise in this area and because this content is directly relevant to the course content that I teach. However, I think a professor/instructor would be doing their full due diligence by referring a student to their counseling center's referral services if they did not want to seek therapy within the Counseling Center (someone who can get students connected to mental health resources outside of the counseling center). It's not a professor/instructor's job to be intimately knowledgeable about how to make appropriate mental health referrals and I think for most professors or instructors, doing so would be pretty clearly outside of their scope of competence. 

I also want to note that while I *am* an undergraduate instructor and I *am* a therapist, I am not a therapist to any of my students. I am happy to pass students along to appropriate resources and I am relatively forgiving about due dates and crises.

The first time we took the exam, two people passed (me, friend A) and one person failed (friend B) but then passed on a retake. Now, five years later:

Me: postdoc, published many papers but none especially good, what I would call a very ""middle-class"" scientist looking to get off the academic track because I recognize I don't have the DRIVE TO PROFESS needed to pursue a TT position.

Friend A: dropped out of the program, couldn't get a masters due to program restrictions and undying hate for lab science, now happily married, working in science assessment, owns a house.

Friend B: postdoc @ NIH, fewer but higher-quality publications than I, rockstar network of both peers and mentors, concrete career path and plan.

All of us: 

* struggled with mental health issues (therapy, medications, NOW! Reach out to your school counseling center yesterday and be up-front about financial hardship), with the financial pressures of grad school, with family drama (for me, homophobic family; for friend A, living with boyfriend; for friend B, abusive mom).  

* had hard conversations with our PIs about the things we weren't good at (I didn't publish enough for my PI; Friend A didn't progress fast enough with data collection; Friend B didn't get along with everyone in the lab). 

* had multiple conversations about scaling back our project ambitions, because that is one of the most common conversations in grad school *period*. 

* along the way, felt crushed, burnt out, and like we should start careers elsewhere.

fmye2p7,timefortea2020,t2_5ljmeij7,"I defended and got my humanities doctorate in 2010. I had several journal articles in okayish journals, a book chapter in an edited volume, had organized several postgraduate conferences, and received 2 prestigious external scholarships to fund the doctorate.  I knew the job market would be tough, but I expected that I would find something. I believed and was told that I was a competitive candidate. When I started, I was told that there were few jobs in the field, and I accepted that. I still thought that if I worked hard enough, I might succeed. Then reality hit.

My applications were a washout on both sides of the Atlantic. Very, very few jobs were posted in my field.I applied for those that appeared, no responses. I got one interview for one of the few non- academia adjacent jobs related to my field. That was a no go.

Fortunately, my PhD-granting institution was able to take me on for a year as a temporary instructor. (It was made clear funding could not exceed that.) Actually, I filled the teaching hole left by my former advisor who left our shrinking field for a more secure job in our adjacent non-academic field. So yeah. A year spent temporarily at the literal desk formerly occupied by my advisor.

Of my cohort, only a handful ever found academic jobs in our field. It was a washout. *My former department is still turning out PhDs, and  I have absolutely no idea where they are ultimately placing - there has been a severe lack of academic jobs in the field for the past decade.*

Ultimately, I decided to do a second master's in a different area with more teaching opportunities. I have now been in my current job for 5 years on an annually renewed contract.  It is not the career I imagined, but I generally enjoy teaching (in spite of the COVID-19 washout semester we are currently in). I am very fortunate to have a partner in a good, stable job. This made getting the second master's possible and compensates for my okay-but-not-great FT NTT salary.

Thinking back to 2010, I can offer the following advice/comments:

1. Sometimes it isn't you. There are many good candidates.
2. Look after your mental health. The academic job market can be draining. I felt a massive sense of failure, guilt, and regret for a long time.
3. Formulate some kind of backup plan in terms of a career/job.
4. You will eventually reach a point at which you no longer want to apply/ it feels futile. Once you reach that point, assess whether you are still a viable candidate/want to continue. For me, after a year of applying to different things in my tiny field, I knew it was time to peace out. Jobs were going to candidates with far more years and publications under their belt.

&amp;#x200B;

It was hard to say goodbye to my field. Even though I was no longer in the field, I eventually published my thesis as a book. Since then, I have moved on to new things and no longer identify as being  a X \[insert noun form of person in field\]. It was sad and difficult, but I am in an okay place now. Part of me does regret not leaving teaching entirely - a NTT job is very risky in the current climate.

Hope this wasn't depressing - it wasn't meant to be. I hope things work out for you. Just know that even if you don't end up working in your field, there will be other opportunities if you pursue them.

I have no direct experience of the history field directly, but my expectation is that for a funded route you need to be right on the top of the pile. This is basically true in STEM, and arts and languages are even less well funded.

Application in the UK are open and public, and while I have seen searches ope where they thought they had a shoe-in candidate, 80% of the time that candidate didn't get the post.

gf51zb3,etal_etal,t2_3h7ric9z,"&gt;So, professors are faced with a very tough judgement call, perhaps one that you haven't fully appreciated: do I be honest in telling a student that I see success in a certain field as unlikely based on the student's cumulative performance, or do I allow the student to move forward while struggling and run the risk of the student investing another chunk of years before the student realizes on his or her own that this just isn't going to work? Now, is a professor's judgment always foolproof? Of course not. 

If the judgement is not foolproof and it can't be by design (the prof doesn't know the student inside out), why then should they say anything at all about the student not being cut out for the field. Sure, they'll think that they're doing the student a favour, but I do not think that it's their place to do such a ""favour"". Criticism should always be in the form of - ""Hey I think currently you're not doing such and such, so you need to do X and Y to make sure you have a chance to be successful in this field"". That's it. This is the best thing a prof can do for a student. It's up to the student to decide whether they are fit for a field, regardless of how many years it would take. It's their life, and they would be solely responsible for their decisions. The profs shouldn't interfere saying leave field Z based on what they think is best for the student.

&gt;If you think about it from our point of view, it's a no-win situation: some students end up bitter and angry that a professor didn't have faith in them, and some students end up angry that their professors allowed them to struggle onward for so long before pointing out the obvious. 

The student can blame the prof saying - I wish you'd have told me earlier. But they'd be wrong, since the profs would absolve themselves of any blame once they tried everything they could do support the student. On the other hand, if the prof steps in with claims of the student being sub-par/not cut out, they're negatively impacting the students chances of success. They would be to blame in that scenario if a student says that they could have been successful if the prof hadn't stepped in and said they're not good enough. The prof can be correctly blamed in that situation. 

IMO it isn't acceptable for a prof to give out judgements like this to students, even if they're thinking that they're going to do the students a favour, or doing it for the benefit of the student. The profs don't get to decide that and it will vary from prof to prof anyway, so why dish out a judgement when it's subjective in the first place? Things like this can have very severe impacts on the mental health of students and the prof doesn't know what the student's background is or what the student might be struggling with in their personal life. It is very condescending to think that the prof knows better about what the student should or should not do with their life. It's the student's own life and career, they get to decide what they should or shouldn't do.",2,2020-12-09 05:23:30,AskAcademia

I am basically you right you (except being in graduate school, I'm just a basic bitch post-bach research specialist). Regarless, throughout most of 2019, I was suffering through crippling anxiety and depression - mostly attributed to family issues, but also regarding my career status. I would procrastinate a lot, and feel even more anxious about not having done any work. Mornings were hard. Waking up was hard. Willing myself into this reality was hard. Often times, I felt completely disconnected from everyone else around me. My work suffered for it. I felt that I could never catch up with the demanding, ever ambitious and self-publishing work ethic of many of my peers/labmates in academia. I felt stuck, and ashamed. 

As fucked up as it sounds, this pandemic has been a blessing in disguise. It has forced everything around me to slow down and has allowed to me take some much needed time for myself and my mental health. Since I no longer feel shameful for not showing up to lab, working from home has proven to be more productive (for all of the reason you've described, and also because I get to work on my own time without the guilt and shame of not being able to work on someone else's). I feel happier, and more motivated now. I've started to enjoy getting up in the morning, exercising, actually eating meals (ones that don't cost me a significant portion of my small salary) Overall, I feel better off.

There are two reasons for this: 1. financial aid and 2. grades. A leave of absence will almost always get a ""W"" grade which will not affect your GPA if you are already taking classes. If you're not registered or taking classes for consecutive semesters your financial aid eligibility may lapse due to restrictions that the school places on your degree time period and other factors. 

Grad school is different than undergrad. They expect you to finish what you started in a reasonable time and they do not like gap semesters. I had to take a semester off after my father died. This was during my second of four semesters and the process was quite simple. However; other than ""personal"" or ""medical' reasons there really was not an option for taking a gap semester. By personal, most universities mean dealing with personal mental health issues, family member illness/death, and the like. Administratively, universities are not going to like extending an LOA for anything other than those things that would not allow you to finish your program. Graduate LOA were very different than undergrad LOA at my university but ymmv. Talk to your academic advisor before you do anything.

Research is a nonlinear process. There may be months and months where you work and nothing will appear to come of it. This will feel discouraging in this extreme. Learn to recognize when you need to keep working and when it is more productive to give yourself a chance to recharge. Rest is also a form of self-discipline.

There are many pathways to success, and many definitions of success. You’re going to feel a lot of pressure — a lot of it well meaning — to want certain goals or work certain ways to achieve them.

The only way I believe you can understand what is most effective is to measure if people get better. But often in the mental health community longitudinal data is not measured. We rely on self report measures, or how the person states they are feeling. One problem with that is people often don't have a good idea of how they are feeling overall versus in the moment. For example - people who are suicidal sometimes present as happy prior to a suicide attempt. Because they now have a sense of relief, that their problems will be over.

My first career I was a musician and did everything “right” in that regard: got into a good, rigorous and well-regarded program and hated it. I am now working in academia and love it (after a winding career road doing a lot of different things). The interesting thing is they’re very similar in terms of pressures and the shiny fantasy you’re sold vs the hard reality it actually is. The biggest difference in me enjoying an being able to work in academia is my mental health hygiene. I have many more tools available to me now that keep me well and even when I get the inevitable rejections, challenges and bumps to my confidence, I can stay even for the most part. Investment into your coping tools is the single most important thing you can do now to be successful.

g582eni,thisSongisAboutYous,t2_834wh506,"I am a 20 year old young woman, not in any prestigious college, but I am an English Lit major, breezing through classes that have nothing to do with literature. It is, however, funny that my high school self can relate to your struggle a lot better. I went to a charter school that focused highly on classical learning and battering the life out of children. At first I enjoyed what I learned, damn, I learned to love learning for the first two years. Academia seemed to be my passion, I thought I’d found my life purpose. But I quickly became exhausted during my junior year and dragged myself to senior year, where I collapsed after one week of school. The entire problem did not lie in how much schoolwork I had, but how much I had completely ignored myself. I mean, yes, I had ignored my physical and mental health, but my biggest mistake was forgetting my own person. I do believe I began with a love for learning about anything and anyone, but as soon as I saw knowledge as competition all was ruined. (I realize this now, I did not see it then). I entered a two year depression, I could not enjoy a single book or enjoy anything for that matter. It is still hard for me to concentrate and read nowadays but I have stopped pitying myself for it and accepted that I am more than what I think others expect of me. I gave so many people around me the idea that I’d be a great scholar and so successful in life that once I could not hold up their expectations anymore, I felt like an absolute failure. And I do believe that in thinking I had failed, I truly and actually failed myself. 
Your biggest stress is feeling like a failure, but at what are you failing? Life? If you think yes, then you are so wrong. Life is not college classes, life is not a fancy degree, life is not how much more work you can do compared to others, life is not who employs you. You should not compare your life to others and call it a failure when it’s not the same. Nothing will ever matter if all you want is to be wanted by your professors, potential employers, and really anybody else in this fucking world. If you don’t want you where you are right now, it’s for a big big big reason. If your mind is deteriorating in the place in life you are now, it is only to push you out of it. In other words, your brain and your body are talking to you and telling you “this place is bad, we must get out”. I understand how incredibly scary it is to leave even a bit of everything you’ve worked for all these years, but it is no longer feeding your life, it is killing it. I am not saying drop everything you’re doing, but at least recognize the cage you’ve built for yourself and be honest about what it’s made out of (other’s expectations, fear of being human) and I know for a fact that you’ll know what to do after that. I can’t tell you what is best for you, only you know that, but first you must see what has brought you so low. 
Again, classes have not brought you this low, neither have grades, but something so much deeper in you that you need to face. This desperation for perfection is not human, it is not what people like to dub as the “key to success”, it is a most damaging coping mechanism. 
From what I’ve read on your post, you sound like a true lover of academia, and I hope with every part of me that you’ll regain that love for its own sake and not for a future career. But please don’t fall prey to the competition this society has made of academia. It was always meant to be a uniting force, not a divisive one.

- If you're working and in a state a flow, don't stop just to force yourself to relax. Recognize when you are getting strained, and then relax. I've ruined a lot of good ""working grooves"" because I arbitrarily stopped when it was the time of the day I usually stop.

- That said, do make time for your hobbies and don't feel guilty about  enjoying that time.

- Also, and related to above, try not to let academic reading ruin your leisure reading. It took me a long time to not feel guilty when reading something that wasn't relevant to my research.

The cold and flu are rampant. They won't contain this and I give it 4 weeks before we start seeing entire classrooms get sick. Normal cleaning procedures are the bare minimum and staff and students are expected to clean when they see a problem, if they are proudly sticking to procedure the outcome is inevitable... Our area has also tried to open and then been shut down a week later multiple times now. We're not containing it.

I don’t have a groundbreaking strategy to offer but I can reassure you that failure happens to all of us. I don’t like the term failure, especially in the academy; experiments are experiments, learning experiences. The outcome may not be what you want but keep going. Many discoveries were accidental.

Ultimately your job should only be part of your larger life. And while it is a big part, it’s not the only part. Right now, it seems like you have been in triage for a lot of years. That’s exhausting and it takes a lot out of you in every possible way. 

You’ve worked hard to get to where you are so obviously you want to have those years work to lead somewhere. However, I’d say your physical and mental health are a priority right now. Without sound health, you will have difficulty with your job. 

You likely have a number of options: 1) look for a related, but low stress job to get insurance and take care of yourself, 2) leave academia for now and look for industry opportunities, 3) look for a completely unrelated, low stress  job for a year or two...etc. 

It’s easy to think that the decision you make now will haunt you for the rest of your life. That’s a lot of pressure. Take the pressure off yourself by making a 1-3 year plan that you will re-evaluate when you are in a better place. There isn’t that much in life that can’t be made up. Yes, if you ultimately decide on academia, you may have to start further back than you would have, but that’s a small price to pay for regaining your life back. 

On a personal note, significant health issues caused me to rethink a lot of my life. Academia had been my dream. It took a long time to get where I am. Quite frankly, now I think this job sucks. It sucks life out of you (hello bragging overworkers), it sucks time out of you, it sucks humility and compassion out of you. It sucks a sense of being valued out of you. Of course, that’s not the case for everyone. I’m just saying that your past goals and expectations may be changed from your experiences. It’s okay to make new goals and set new expectations. What you want from your life is more important than what others think you should want from your life.

For me, it's always been skiing and snowboarding.  In high school and college I'd get my lift ticket and spend almost every waking hour from Saturday morning to Sunday night on the slopes, and in college often on weekdays as well (I'd schedule my classes around skiing).  In the third year of my PhD I was in a funk (there's absolutely no skiing any time of the year within driving distance of my university) and was able to get a 4-month visiting student position in a great lab near some pretty good slopes (one of my advisor's PhD buddies was the PI).  

Over those 4 months, I lost a ton of weight, got into the best shape of my life, and (maybe) most importantly, came up with the research that would form the cornerstone of my thesis.  If I couldn't figure out the solution to some problem, I'd put away my computer, get in my car (I always kept my skis at the lab), and go skiing for a few hours.  Sometimes, a possible solution would come to me, and I'd end my ski session and hurry to the lab (or just my apartment) and write some quick code and run it on the server to see if it worked.  

I have grad student friends all over the country, and many of them have an outdoor activity they're obsessed with that keeps them healthy and going strong even in the most stressful parts of their PhD.  Most PIs (in my field) don't care if you take a Wednesday off to go rock climbing, skiing, hiking, cycling, sailing or windsurfing -- for those who enjoy these kinds of activities (and have access to them) I think a PhD is much less taxing on your mental health.

Of course, different people work at different rates. My degrees were all in the humanities, so lots of writing throughout have me plenty of practice. Don't get discouraged, just keep going. Pace yourself by alternating between outlining, writing, editing, and reviewing for flow and content. If you can't get your brain to focus on one task, try another, at least for five minutes.

If you would like more flexibility with where you end up as faculty, a PhD might be a better fit, although there is a focus on research.

Your work background will absolutely help you be a better candidate for admission into a PhD program and eventually, a faculty position.

I hope that there are other people in your life--loved ones or close friends--who you can turn to for support through this, as well.

There is not really one right way to tell your PI about your mental health--it first and foremost depends upon what you feel comfortable sharing with him. There are pros and cons to sharing less or more--sometimes hearing a specific diagnosis such as PTSD helps a person to understand what is going on for you more clearly than describing your symptoms in broad terms, but with that diagnosis also comes stigma.

If I were in your PI's shoes, I would have a general idea that you are experiencing some mental health concerns and might not fully understand what is going on for you (which is okay! You are under no obligation to share the full details). If you want to, you might be a little more direct and specific: ""I want to follow up upon our previous conversation. I experienced a prolonged abusive situation about 2-3 years ago. I am in therapy and, through that process, coming to better understand the ways in which that is affecting me, such as my memory, ability to concentrate, etc., and ultimately a diagnosis of PTSD. I can assure you that I am doing the very best that I can right now, including sticking with therapy and medication. At the same time, I am experiencing some challenges right now with X and Y, and I wanted to help you to better understand those challenges.""

Again, it's up to you whether to be more specific in that kind of a way. Perhaps it helps your PI to better understand where you're coming from. There are also PIs who would respond in ways that are judgmental or perpetuate stigma about mental health challenges. You know your PI better than any of us do.

Doing a PhD with both mental and physical illnesses, especially uncontrolled ones (it took the last two years for me to reset and gain a semblance of normalcy- i only just feel about 80-85% now), is extremely hard. I have to advocate for myself on a regular basis, work less hours a week, and be meticulously dedicated and conscientious about my health, my doctors appointments and medications. I’m slower to meet milestones and it sometimes feels like my peers are a mile ahead of me.  And there are always the 1 or 2 professors or students who will judge the sh*t out of you. 

All that said though: I’m in good standing, my GPA looks great, i enjoy my research and my department, and i just secured myself some funding for my dissertation project. I wouldn’t be able to do this without a wonderfully kind and flexible PI, an amazing support system, and a loud mouth that isn’t afraid to speak out when i feel myself starting to veer off. I’ve made a lot of mistakes trying to handle my health, and so have my advisors, and so has my body (lol). But if i could give a TL;DR it would be to always always always put your health before your work. Academia will encourage you to do the opposite, which is where i think people with chronic conditions will struggle a lot, because our threshold for “too much” is kind of low, and “too much” is the standard in academia. But the more I’m working within my limits, the more I’m seeing that academia doesn’t have to be this way. You do not have to work unhealthy amounts to do well. You do have to work hard.

gqcdx8i,wjs018,t2_7z5at,"Some context for my experience: I work in pharma R&amp;D in a partially lab-based position (~50%). I got my start out of grad school (Physics PhD) in a fully lab based position about 5 years ago. Also, I am not in CA, but am in the greater Boston area.

I don't have direct experience with the non-lab based positions in the industry as much. I work closely with many of them for things like clinical safety feedback, regulatory communications, toxicology, project managers, external business development, legal, etc. There are many different avenues into the industry that don't require lab work.

I can't speak as to what is expected or regular for the non-lab positions. However, in my area of Biologics Process Development a PhD would be required to eventually reach the salaries you have listed. For reference, with a PhD, I just started a new position in the past couple months that brings my salary (including bonus) up to ~135k. As I have worked longer in the job, the amount of time I have spent in the lab has decreased as I have taken on more management roles, managing the research associates (BS &amp; MS positions) that actually carry out many of the studies that I have designed and manage. For example, in the past three months, I have only been in the lab a handful of days as the work that needs to be done is being handled by a combination of our contract manufacturer and a couple of our research associates.

In general, I would only suggest a PhD if you are sure about it. /r/gradschool is littered with posts about the mental health toll that a PhD program takes on grad students. I have helped several of my grad school colleagues out with getting jobs in the industry. The first job you get is always going to be the hardest. Once you are in the industry, it is much easier to move around within that bubble and all the companies I have worked for encourage people to explore moves to other departments inside the company. This is a way for these companies to retain talent even if their current position isn't a great fit, as that is really the limiting factor in a very concentrated area like the Boston area.

While I’m years away from actually deciding on a PhD (masters first), I am making all my educational decisions by putting my mental health first. Because if I’m a mess in school I won’t be at my best and will not be able to handle it! Mental health is nothing to mess around with when it comes to school and career.

I think making peace with not being a ‘traditional’ student is important - being able to accept that things can be harder for me to handle but I WILL get through them no matter what. Finding an understanding advisor is a requirement. Also, at least in natural sciences, I don’t necessarily have to work in academia to satisfy the curiosity that I have. In the US there are government agencies I can work for where I can do research that matters, for example.

Hope this helps - just my anecdotal experience.",2,2020-05-25 18:04:21,AskAcademia
gqmcky4,myristicae,t2_1i5lscjc,"A friend of mine with schizophrenia finished his degree a few years ago (masters I think?) We were friends, not colleagues (we briefly went to the same school) but he always seemed like a bright and focused student. I can't think of anyone I know in academia that has bipolar disorder, but I know lots of people who have severe depression, anxiety, or both that already graduated or are on the path to graduate. My best friend in elementary school had bipolar (I think it's rarely diagnosed in children so I'm not sure why/how he got the diagnosis). He definitely had ups and downs in mood but he was an intelligent classmate and a good friend. 

I would never assume someone was unintelligent based on them having schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, but I do know more about mental health than your average person. Even so, I'm not aware of stereotypes about intelligence or aptitude. 

I will say that, personally, I think it was inappropriate for your colleagues to share your health information. Maybe they just know you were hospitalized, since you left mid-semester, even if they don't know the details? I think whenever someone has a serious illness (mental or bodily) or experiences bereavement etc., people can sometimes be ""too nice"" in a way that makes the person feel singled out or like they're being treated as weak. I think it wouldn't be inappropriate to bring it up gently and casually with people one-on-one. You could tell them you appreciate their concern and that they want to be there for you, but you also want them to treat you like the other students, with the same honest critiques, workloads, etc.

fs5j9e1,synthesis-synthesis,t2_3ev125pt,"Professor here. I'm sorry you're having such a difficult time.

**1)** Are you seeing or have you ever seen a therapist? If I were in charge of the universe, I'd actually make it mandatory for graduate students. Academia both creates and exacerbates mental health issues like anxiety and depression. A trained therapist will be an impartial but compassionate sounding board who can equip you with new strategies to navigate your cognitive and behavioral struggles. On a more basic level, they will help you feel less alone and stupid. (You are not stupid.)

**2)** In your penultimate paragraph are you saying you've simultaneously been working full-time? No wonder you're stalled. *Graduate school is a full-time job in and of itself.* There's a reason why in the U.S. doctoral students are generally prohibited from having other forms of employment.

**3)** People who suggest you should continue because you passed your classes and ""just"" have the thesis left grossly misunderstand what research is. *The thesis is the hard part!* Unlike courses, where you're familiarizing yourself with other people's studies and methods, **the thesis is where you attempt to make an original argument and a disciplinary intervention*****.*** If that were easy, everyone would be doing it.

**4)** I appreciate that other posters have wished you well and encouraged you to finish. Perhaps that's what you want and need. I'm here to tell you ***you don't have to finish.*** I want to give you permission to leave, in case that's what you actually need but are afraid to ask for.

**There will literally be no consequences.** ZERO. Let's address two things:

You're clearly afraid of what people will think of you. *You're overestimating how much people think about you in the first place.* I don't say that to be cruel. It's actually really liberating! We spend almost all of our time thinking about ourselves. Good professors, even great ones, mostly think about students when we're literally in the room with them. Beyond that? We've got research, grant writing, faculty meetings, spouses, childcare, elder care, committee work, etc. 

**No one's livelihood depends on you getting an MA, including your own.** None of your colleagues or friends will be ""disappointed"" because your decision has no impact on them. *They just want you to be happy and fulfilled.*

Perhaps your family will judge you; I can't say, because I don't know them. But there are really only **three outcomes. 1)** If they're emotionally mature people with clear boundaries, they won't be disappointed. Why should they be? It's your life, not theirs. You tried something and didn't like it. **2)** If they're good people but less emotionally mature, they'll keep any disappointment to themselves and get over it. **3)** If they're not emotionally mature, unfortunately they'll share it with you but then eventually get over it. 

But no matter how anyone reacts, what matters most is how you feel. And you need to find a way (ideally with a therapist) to work through all this **unnecessary shame** about making a decision. As I mentioned above, the MA (or PhD) is a full-time job. Would you feel this anxious about leaving a job you didn't like? This is the same thing. 

*Academia is not some special place for special people. It just wants you to believe that so institutions can exploit adjuncts and get free labor out of graduate students.* I say this as someone who has had incredible success in academia. I don't idealize it, and I believe it's my ethical duty to be frank with my undergraduates and graduate students. **People suffer most when they tie their self-worth to academia.** 

I hope you can find a way to stop doing that, no matter what decision you make.

Good luck with everything.",2,2020-05-29 01:29:28,AskAcademia

fqcm0nu,synthesis-synthesis,t2_3ev125pt,"First, congratulations! No, you definitely don't have to take it. But, if there are no other jobs in or out of academia on the table, I don't think you should put yourself in the precarious position of unemployment, especially now. Remember that you can leave whenever you want.

I'm a young professor who did my PhD at an Ivy and now work at a highly ranked R1. Some of my fellow junior colleagues approach their research and teaching with a lot of distorted cognitive/behavioral patterns. These include catastrophizing, negative self-talk, black and white thinking, etc. I know one person who convinced herself last year that she had to wake up 3am to do course prep (there was no logical reason). I have two friends who constantly insult their own work in casual conversation and struggle to acknowledge and celebrate their achievements.

**I don't do any of that. You don't have to either.**

Some of it is temperamental. It's not that I don't feel stress; it's just that I respond to stress by reminding myself that I'm competent enough to fix issues that are in my control and smart enough to let go of issues that aren't.

Some of it is nurture. I grew up really poor and was the first person in my family to attend college, so that helps keep things in perspective.

I love this job, but it doesn't define me, and it doesn't make me special. Universities want to convince us that being in academia is a gift, not ""just"" a job. That way, we'll willingly sacrifice our physical and mental well-being for the chance to adjunct at three different institutions and teach five classes without health insurance. I think students and faculty struggle most when they buy into this lie and tie their self-worth to academia.

You can take this job and perform it in many ways. You can kill yourself trying to become a ""rockstar."" **Or not.** I'm able to spend a lot of time on my hobbies, which include playing the piano and writing fiction. I give myself reasonable research expectations and generally meet them *because they are reasonable*. I assert clear boundaries with colleagues and students (for example, I don't check emails after 5pm/on the weekends).

I catch up with long-distance friends regularly. I'm living in my first nice apartment. I grab drinks with colleagues to celebrate birthdays, publications, and the last day of class. When I feel like it, I travel on breaks and during summers. Other than my two teaching days, I control my schedule. I always do what's most important to me first. Everyone else's needs/wants come second.

As long as you have clear boundaries around your work, it's great. Teaching is the hardest area to get under control, but it gets *a lot* easier after the first year. I do sympathize with packing up and moving to an unfamiliar town/city alone. That's been the hardest part for me. Most faculty, junior and senior, move with partners. (You might consider seeing a therapist to process the stress of the PhD and the possibility of transitioning to a faculty position.)

There's a good article entitled ""The Awesomest 7-Year Postdoc or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Tenure-Track Faculty Life"" that I think would provide some helpful framing.

I have found that when I go days to weeks under a stressful schedule where full day/7 day a week is necessary for the output I need, I need to listen to my brain- I mean I take a break when I need it, whether or not I can really ‘afford’ to take one. While there are many days I struggle to focus or be productive, often after wasting some time I can kick my butt in gear and accomplish something. But some days are different, and I feel the stress rising uncontrollably, or I can objectively see that my brain is not working at full capacity. Those times are when I need to take a break, and I don’t mean watch an episode, I mean literally take the rest of the day off. Humans are not meant to work in such a high demand environment as grad school can be and I have come to realize that the more I randomly take a drive and go on a spontaneous hike or visit a friend, when I come back the next day or two later my brain is clear and refocused.

foyg0e5,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"Some thoughts:

1. Yes, by all means it's okay to link to YouTube videos. Sometimes, someone has spent a lot of time and production quality doing something you'd like to show, and often there is no need to reinvent the wheel. Make sure that YouTube videos you link to are at a level that is accessible for your students.

2. Think about the distinction you'd like to make between what you show yourself and what you want to link to. I teach classes about mental health and counseling, and when I use videos in-class or online, I often try to think about what kinds of videos can offer something I can't myself; for me, that is often videos where people with a mental health condition share their first-person experiences, or clips of therapy sessions. For you, that may be different; I'm not sure what STEM field you're in, but I could imagine things like chemical reactions, physics demonstrations, etc. being great to show in video format rather than conduct yourself. I typically don't use external videos as the only source of key course concepts; rather, I think of them as a way to build upon key concepts that I've highlighted and prompt discussion. I encourage you to think of what you'd like to provide in your own videos, and then think of how outside videos can build off of that to make your online class a richer learning experience.

3. All of what I just said is ideal, but it's also the middle of a pandemic, so do what feels realistic for you. But I will say that just because there are well-produced YouTube videos on a variety of topics in your field doesn't mean that students would prefer to watch an assortment of professionally produced videos from various YouTube channels. There is a value to continuity with a single person (that being you!) and explaining things not just in sleek professional videos, but in ways that build nicely on each other in the context of your class and feel accessible to your students. It's all about balance, and I encourage you to think intentionally about the mix of your own videos and external videos you'd like to include.",2,2020-04-29 14:50:51,AskAcademia

gnyv8a9,roseofjuly,t2_oeiny,"Clinical psychology is incredibly competitive in *any* year. My background is in psychology and I also studied mental health, so I know a ton of folks who went clinical; students who had 2-3 years of undergraduate RA experience + 1-2 years of lab management/full-time research experience + clinical hours up the wazoo sometimes had to apply two or even three rounds before getting offers, and that's with applying to 7-12 programs each round. Clinical psychology is *incredibly* competitive.

I'm also BIPOC and my research area was in the same general area as yours. Are you tied to being a clinician? Because if not, there are *lots* of other PhD programs that are less competitive where you can study that. Look at health psychology, neuroscience (if you have the background for it), or public health as other avenues.

If you are looking only at research assistant positions at universities in psychology departments, I would also expand that. First, you can look across the university: there are research coordinator jobs in the medical/health sciences departments of universities that may have relevant research going on, too (think psychiatry, neurobiology, public health, perhaps even nursing).

First of all, I hope that you can be kind to yourself. You are dealing with a lot right now! In addition to general struggles with depression, you've grieving the loss of your father, dealing with a pandemic, and I imagine feel more isolated from support systems than you normally do. I am so glad that you have a compassionate doctor, and your doctor is right: this is a difficult time for everybody right now, and it makes sense that you would struggle with motivation in the middle of this pandemic.

I don't think it's reasonable for a supervisor to expect the same out of you or anyone else during a freaking pandemic. By all means do the work you have the capacity to do, as it sounds like you are, but also, it's okay if you can't quite be as productive as you were pre-pandemic. That's just not a reasonable expectation, and I don't know a single soul who is as productive as before. Myself included--I'm slower at things right now, too. I don't know exactly what your supervisor said, and certainly there is a place for constructive criticism and setting goals to get certain things done, even during this pandemic. But I'm sorry that it felt so uncompassionate and like a personal attack.

I'm not sure what your email said, so it's hard to comment on it, but I can see why you would send such an email. It's clear that you felt overwhelmed in that moment, and for good reason. You so wanted to feel understood, for your supervisor to know that you are struggling. I also know that there is a stigma to mental illness, and it makes sense that you are worried that disclosing your struggles might negatively impact your future opportunities.

I encourage you to sit on this for at least a day or two and then revisit what you wrote. Perhaps some fresh eyes will give you some new perspective. If you think it's worth following up with your supervisor, you can do so via email or over video. You can even say what you said here: you've been struggling a lot and wanted your supervisor to know what you've been going through, but that you're worried about what he will think of it or that he may see you as lazy. The one thing I encourage you to consider sharing, if you did not do so already, is that you are currently receiving professional care to manage your depression. You don't need to go into any details of the care, but I can see how if you disclose a serious struggle with mental illness, conveying that you are also working hard to manage your depression may help to reduce some of the stigma and convey to a potential future letter writer that this is something you are actively managing rather than unmanaged mental illness. If you choose to follow up with your supervisor, consider writing an email, saving the draft, and then reviewing it and sending it a day later. If you choose to follow up on Zoom/the phone, then consider outlining some key points you'd like to make a day in advance and sleep on it.

I don't know much about your supervisor, but this is surely a hard time for him, too. If he's otherwise a nice person, hopefully he will be understanding. Sometimes it can be helpful to know the extent of a struggle a person is going through in understanding why a person may not be as productive as before. I certainly hope that what you shared helps him to be compassionate and empathetic. As long as you were polite in your email, you did nothing wrong. And while none of us can guarantee the outcome, I certainly wish you all of the best. We're all here with you.",2,2020-04-27 21:26:11,AskAcademia

frt0z7s,SupSquark,t2_vhfat,"I'll speak from personal experience here. I graduated with my first degree in physics (UK MPhys) last year after four years. For the entirety of those four years my mental and physical health were terrible - I was severely anorexic and threatened with suspension /  being kicked out early.  I've always known I've wanted to do a PhD and had some pretty good friends who reminded me constantly that I was about to die/ really wasn't fit to live alone/move abroad/ survive a PhD the  way I was. 

My transcript for 2nd year was abysmal - we're talking 40% for computational physics with my highest mark being 70% in the easiest exam (still one of the lowest in the class). No information was retained; in fact I have hardly any memories whatsoever. 

When it was time to apply for PhD positions my friends sat me down and made it clear that I had to get better and so I made many attempts with university counselling (which eventually worked), saw a GP etc. but I definitely wasn't fit to do a PhD. The PhD I wanted was 1300km away meaning if I got better, body would ever have to know; it also gave me a timeframe of only 6 months to be physically fit - so no, I didn't disclose to my PhD supervisor that I was (at the time) ill; I still haven't because it's not a huge part of my life anymore however (and this is VERY IMPORTANT) if I were to relapse I would be comfortable in speaking to my supervisor about it. 

Over the 6 months from March - September I worked damn hard on myself. I caught up on physics I'd never learned, gained weight, learned to cook good food and then I was ready to move abroad. I'm not cured by any means - there are still difficult days/weeks/months but my passion for doing physics beats that and there's no way you can fully commit to your passion when you're struggling constantly. Now, nobody would believe just over a year ago I was skeletal and almost dead if it weren't; for my ever more infrequent instagram rants about food.

Those 6 months were crucial and if I were you, I'd make sure you have a sufficient amount of time off before starting another degree. You want to equip yourself for a graduate degree - it's intense, fast past, and often leaves very little time for oneself. You should build yourself a support group of people ho can keep you accountable, look out for you and to whom you can go when struggling. Finally, strongly consider what you'd hope to achieve by keeping your mental health a secret from a potential supervisor - if they judge you based on it, you probably don't want to work with them; ditto if you don't feel like you trust them with the info. Supervisors are mentors and will want to know you personally, if you try to mask your mental health you run the risk of not establishing as good a relationship as is possible.

I finished my PhD and it was really tough.

Firstly, kudos for pursuing academia having been in a similar position and secondly, I completely understand what you mean in that academics are under the pump constantly and being an honours student, I’m going to naturally be behind post doc and PhD students on their priority list.

And it’s not that my supervisors are uncaring and perhaps indifferent isn’t the right word... it’s just that I very much feel on the bottom of the ladder with them and I don’t want to be more of a burden than I already get the vibe.

I saw this post and immediately I felt that someone entirely embodied everything I had been feeling for a while now. I read all the comments below and they felt very helpful as well. I recently made a very similar post here and got some advice that told me maybe keep going. But i had been doing a lot of soul searching, a lot of questioning myself and I felt exactly the same as you. I’m starting to feel that I can always go back and get a phd again if I want to and I truly felt like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders once I started thinking that way. Also, even the complex you mentioned abt your teacher, i have a similar memory that mostly fueled some of my higher education passion in the past. But once (after many many years and painfully conditioning myself to think this way) i started thinking that nothing, and I mean NOTHING is more important than looking after your health (mental and physical), i started to realize it’s ok to quit sth for pursuing another path if that thing is costing you something much more valuable than whatever it is adding into your life. Anyways, i’m sorry abt this weirdly long and maybe slightly poetic reply, but basically what i’m saying is that since I started thinking it’s ok to leave a phd to pursue sth else for a while and try to do a phd again if you want later in life, I have been feeling the lightest i have felt in a long long time. I suggest that you also sort out your way of thinking and priorities and decide based on that. And do not forget to put yourself and your well-being really high up on that list.

I believe we have reached this point because of the publish or perish culture mixed with some arrogance and *superioriy of mission* ideology.

This honestly sounds like anxiety speaking -- maybe your supervisors are giving off this vibe, but perhaps they are just being neutral (possibly even concerned but trying not to push you to speak about the issues if you don't want to, and instead waiting for you to bring it up) and this is you projecting?

do3ylli,PorkYewPine,,"As others have mentioned, you should work on getting a more precise idea of what you want to study and with whom you want to work. Many programs require that you have an advisor ready before submitting an application. Make sure this is really what you want. 

But I would like to speak to you about the other things you mentioned. Reading your post was like reading my own thoughts from many years ago. I am severely introverted and have dealt with depression for most of my teenage and now adult life.

As an undergraduate, I pushed so many people away, which compounded my problems. I basically lived for a year in solitary confinement in my apartment. I rarely attended class. I did nothing but watch tv and play video games. I failed every class one semester. Like straight F's. And I can't erase that from my transcript. 

My problems eventually turned into alcohol abuse and suicidal ideation. I will spare you the entire story, but I am very fortunate to be alive now. I am even more fortunate to be on the career path that I am as I finally went back to school, got my master's, and will begin a PhD program next year despite how embarrassing my transcript is. 

I am in no way saying that your story would be the same as mine, but I just want to caution you to think about some of those other problems you mentioned. It took way too long for me to seek out help for my problems, but counseling was essential to my recovery. Most universities have free mental health services, which is what I used. The people there were very welcoming and understanding. As an introvert myself, I know how difficult it can be to step out of your comfort zone and go to a place like that. But I can assure you that they want to help you and they will help you. 

Being an introvert is challenging in any realm of life. We have to approach situations differently. But it is possible to have a normal life. It's perfectly fine to be an introvert, but if you are struggling with depression, pushing people away, etc. then it's going to be very difficult to succeed either in graduate school or in a professional career outside of academia.

First, I would say, if you can, take a break.  Even if it is just for a few weeks, or a month.  Take some time away from what you're studying and see if you find yourself missing it after time away from it. 

I really wish I had taken some time between my PhD and my postdoc.  With that time I would have reflected on:

1) What I really wanted to do with my life -- particularly in light of what happened to my partner, it is a life changer. For me, it definitely oriented me towards wanting to be involved in the mental health field

2) If I had chosen a postdoc, what was the criteria that I was basing my decision off of, i.e. location, research, institution, supervisor, etc. -- I would have talked to more people about my choice, really explored more

3) My own mental health -- I think because I finished my PhD, I thought I was fine, but there were cracks in the veneer.  The same may not be the case for you, but I wish I'd sought out more consistent counseling and therapy. 

For me now, I wouldn't say I regret sticking with it. My life has been a wildly fascinating and unpredictable road of twists and turns that has taken me to some of the most beautiful places I could have ever imagined, and one thing is true about academia -- I have met some incredible humans. 

Now though, approaching my mid-30s, there are things I want for myself that I feel a bit desperate about -- I want a family, I want stability, I want a job that cares about me as much as I care about it, and a partner who fits the same criteria.  Maybe we can't have it all, but I want to start being serious about how to make these things happen for me, and realistically, I'm not sure if I can do that with academia.

I only have experience with grad school at two institutions, but one of them was abusive and exploitative, the other is intellectually far more challenging and a lot of work, but has a vastly better learning environment and a lot of support. I can verify firsthand that some programs are tougher to get through than others, and it's not because they're ""better"" or ""harder"", but because they're dysfunctional and exploitative. 

I don't think being married makes grad school easier, for all the reasons you mention (my fiance and I are looking at LDR for a while, because he wants to do his MS in Seattle and I am in a program in Portland) but having emotional support does. 

Grad school is hard. Some programs are easier than others, and some people go into it with better scaffolding and financial support. If academia is serious about improving diverse perspectives in order to expand the scope and creativity of research, we need to provide better institutional scaffolding for those who don't have it from their families and friends.

ej2wflm,pugaholic,t2_6mmnm,"My mental health was severely affected during my undergraduate. It was never bad enough to go inpatient, but there were times I was suicidal and close to dropping out. I went on a year abroad but had a breakdown, came home for a rest and physically couldn’t go back - panic attack at the airport, couldn’t get on the plane, etc. I had to deal with the fallout (I was employed on my year abroad) and get it all signed off at university so that I could come back for my final year. It was absolutely awful and one of the worst times of my life. I didn’t leave my house for weeks. I completely sympathise with you and also understand the desire to get back to “normal” while faced with crippling anxiety over even dealing with it. 

I will break it down into some practical steps for you, or what helped me at least. 

* Go to your GP, and get a medical certificate confirming your inpatient stay and/or a letter stating current circumstances. This documentation will probably be necessary for you to continue onwards. 
* Contact your university mental health resources, wellbeing centre, or otherwise. Send an email describing your situation and asking for help. They may be able to liaise on your behalf with your department, offer general advice, and generally support you. 
* How is your relationship with your supervisor? I found what helped me the most was working with my tutor, who thankfully I trusted. She was my first point of contact and took the lead in arranging the meetings that I needed. Send them an email describing the situation and ask for help. Keep it brief if necessary. 
* Bring someone with you to meetings with your university if you can. I took my mum, lol, which was embarrassing, but I was in no fit state to deal with anything and she was my advocate. I barely remember the meetings we attended and she took notes and made sure she was on top of things for me. If you have someone who can help you, a friend or partner or relative, lean on them. If you don’t have someone like that or it’s inappropriate for you, that’s why it’s good to contact wellbeing services and your tutor/supervisor first off. 
* Find your university guide and regulations surrounding doctoral study and the rules about sickness etc. 
* Take all the time you need to get yourself together.
* Send emails if it’s too overwhelming to step foot on campus for now. Sending emails may help you with the word soup as well. 

You can do it. Take it one baby step at a time. First I would prioritise sending a few emails and booking an appointment with your GP. Then see what comes of that and you can arrange in person meetings when you can. I found my university 100% supportive and kind in this process. There are rules and guidelines in place for this kind of thing and I believe you will be able to reattend and get back on track - with the medical certificate etc, I think they basically have to let you. It’s only been a month or so, right? That’s a drop in the bucket. They might advise you go back to part time, or extend your duration a bit, I’m not sure - /r/AskAcademiaUK might have more advice on this front.

Of course the students are not the instigators, but that is what a strike does: the employees use the consumers as a pawn. When they complain loud enough, the boss will give in to the demands. 

On doing a refund: it is quite complex: tuition fees pay for a lot of things but let's assume you pay £18000/year as an overseas student. You get roughly 18 hours of lectures every week for 30 weeks. So you are paying £600/week. Not all lectures are spread evenly over the week so some students will miss 5 hours, other 15 hours and so on. Now imagine all the administration you would have to do to refund everyone for missed lectures. And then we are not discounting that part of your fees are going to the library, buildings, equipment, mental health support, cheap food, et cetera. So from that 600 a week, you will get only a small part back and to what expense. The administration will be more flooded with processing refunds and will not be able to help with other things. 

On rescheduling: you will run in problems with space (let's forget about the pandemic and assume you can work at full capacity): lecture halls cannot be double-booked. If you have a class with 100 students, they need a large lecture hall. You cannot teach on the college green. Employment law and health and safety will make it very difficult to teach over the weekend or out of hours. So there are a lot of factors that make rescheduling a very complex thing. 

Students have been on the picket supporting teachers. They understand that staff are being exploited. Students have the right to ask why teachers are on precarious contracts. If staff is happy, they will be better teachers. If you know that at the end of the semester you will be chucked out by the Uni, you will not invest too much time and energy in creating a syllabus.

I want to echo other folks’ point about directing students to student services at the school. I would tell students about these services not because I don’t necessarily want to support them (if I can), but because I’m not properly trained and equipped to support students around certain matters. I have found that when I explain it as such to students, they feel that I am considering what might be in their best interest and that I do care about their well-being. 

Most students will see that you are available but probably not the best point of contact for issues such as their mental health, addictions, or history of abuse and trauma. 

I would also add that it’s useful to establish group norms around being mindful of others— including yourself. My students will ask me, for instance, whether I am in the right space to listen to them discuss sensitive topics, and I will also be courteous and give them a heads up as well so that they can excuse themselves from class if they need to. 

Another life skill I like to emphasize to students is how to assert and define one’s boundaries.  It becomes a great opportunity for learners and teachers to share what they need of each other to be their best (but also what we can and cannot give).

I am a dragon on cheating , I hate it, but I really don’t think you cheated, exactly and I think you are giving yourself a hard time over things that were more bad judgment than dishonesty.

I also 100% think this was a friendly warning becasue I have said exactly this kind of thing in class, like I know the authors of the book can pass the class , stop copying it for your HW assignments, enough said.  This is the friendly warning.

Reasons why I thought it was the right choice: 
1) I wanted to travel (new internship was in San Diego) and I got to spend a summer in an absolutely beautiful new environment (really great memories and good for my mental health)
2) the new internship provided a whole different set of techniques.

This kept things flexible, and ultimately allowed me to discover things that I both enjoyed and disliked.  
3) more connections! 

I found myself much more interested in the realm of research I conducted during my first internship (and am planning on pursuing grad school in this area), but I do not regret exploring the new opportunities because it was still a great learning experience all around, and lead me to discover things I DON'T want to pursue (which is valuable).

Through the collaborations I've had at those other labs (including one in industry), I now have a large ""network"" in my field.

When I hear ""networking"" I think about the much shallower types of connections people often make in industry (""add me on Linkedin""), and this is quite different to how it works in academia.

As far as making friends goes: graduate students are most successful when they have a support system and maintain good mental health.

Looking for jobs, I saw there is opportunities for PhDs in the industry here in Europe (BTW, maybe look for positions around here). Where I'll work 36 - 40h a week, make more money and actually contribute to society.

Working as a Quant in finance will make you a lot of money, with less worked hours and better mental health. I say go for it.

dsxlgx0,HermanTheKid,t2_6t6ri,"I actually think that the question is too broad, although your very good point about correlation of multiple factors is part of how the topic could be narrowed. The comparison of women who wear versus do not wear a hijab is going to be influenced by many other related cultural factors. Also, at least in Saudi Arabia, I'm not sure that you could find women not wearing the hijab, so that's going to be a problem. One way to narrow this would be to look at the mental well-being of girls and young women at the time they start wearing the hijab (I'm not a scholar of Saudi customs, but I assume at age 10 or so just a bit before puberty?) and to do some before/after comparisons. Thus, every girl would be her own before/after comparison. This also obviously has a lot or correlated matters that would need to be addressed, not least of which is that there is a whole host of psychological changes around puberty. However, it may be possible to account for some of these. 

As far as mental health, again I think that this is too broad. Something more specific and age-appropriate might be ""How the transition to wearing the hijab impacts the self-image of pre-pubescent Saudi girls"". Again, even this is rife with confounders, but it not an altogether unassailable question.

To OP: You're better off (at least at the MPH level, perhaps not at the PhD level) selecting an adviser who is better at advising than an adviser who is more knowledgeable in your subject. ",1,2018-01-19 19:06:04,AskAcademia
g2scmtk,needlzor,t2_43i1t,"&gt; Or should I be asking potential advisors if I’ll be having time to write?

Advisors who are desperate for students will say anything to have you work with them. They will also behave perfectly for the first 6 months, until it's time to start courting their next victim, at which point they will throw you into a metaphorical dungeon and begin their hunt. I used to think I could detect this behaviour by looking at the size of the student pool of an advisor: PhD farmers tend to have a lot more students than the ""normal"" ones, but then I met with people who supervised 12-15 PhD students and somehow made time for all of them so I know my rule of thumb isn't good, but it can be an indicator. 

My only piece of advice would be to contact a few of their students (with different starting dates) and ask them about their opinion of the lab and their research environment. Mention that you are thinking about applying under their advisor but don't ask them directly about the advisor - if they are a psycho they will tell you by themselves. Ask them how the university is treating them, how much time they have to write, what the expectations are, etc. If one of them seems talkative offer to buy them a coffee at the school cafeteria (grad students rarely refuse free coffee) to ask them follow up questions in person (but at a distance, COVID and all).

g2odgu0,LankyTower,t2_33g5203t,"Hey thanks for the reply!! Ooh fair I'm guessing something social sciencey then so I'm sure you know what you're talking about. And that makes sense, I suppose one's capacity to be a good student transcends your level of study at the end of the day. I would say I'm not a terrible student, I just had a bit of a rough time before getting to uni and I needed some time to work stuff out after having got away from some of the bad stuff at home, and unfortunately that coincided with starting my degree. I try to make the effort in lectures and seminars and I read a lot outside of whats set just because I'm interested in everything we're doing but I just need to get better at organizing myself sometimes and then hopefully I'll be golden (luckily the uni is giving me free counseilling for that so woo).

And yeah, everything you're saying is completely fair, I can't imagine its exactly a walk in the park but I do realise nowadays that my own mental health should be at the fore of my considerations in life. I have been thinking maybe go for a masters like you said and see how I feel from there as maybe it will be a good gauge as to whether I'm suited for study beyond that. I suppose I do feel like I've got my life together sufficiently with several years now of being far more aware of my mental health and having been treated for it now I do feel far more resiliant than when I started but I do take your point it is rather like playing with fire. And again, yeah no I completely agree, the academic job market does look rather abysmal especially at the moment, and especially for a subject like social anthro, I suppose I just genuinely love it as a subject so much that I do feel a genuine desire to go as far as I can with it in terms of qualifications and training, I just need to be wary of what you're saying about academic jobs as well. I've got myself trained in business admin and the postgraduate course I'm looking at also has a big filmaking element to it and I've been trying to teach myself to edit video footage so that maybe whilst I'm doing postgrad and maybe beyond if the jobs are scarse at the time I can always have a supplementary form of income. But I completely see where you're coming from and it's definately something I'll factor into my decision of what I do in terms of study.

And thanks dude, I really hope you do too, one thing I will say is that none of the jobs I've had outside academia (at least here) have really cared about mental health, and in some cases have almost preyed on it to get me to work beyond my means, and at least in academia in the UK there does seem to be a lot more understanding of people's limits when it comes to this stuff, but obviously it can always be better.

My dream really is to go to Manchester and they’re quite competitive for anthropology so I’m just thinking would a transcript with lots of blanks on look a bit bad even if it was for mental health reasons?

And yeah that makes sense, I’ve been asking myself a lot whether I think this career path is right for me and whether I’m actually cut out for it but I genuinely want to do it so badly, like past the kind of idealist dreams of what it would be like I feel like I really do want to do a phd so that i can do teaching and research but I realise I obviously need to be in the right state of mind before I start, Will probably think about it a lot more in the meantime

And yeah you’re right again, I suppose it’s just a bit daunting sometimes seeing all these smart looking profiles on LinkedIn and researchgate etc just makes you feel a bit slow on the uptake sometimes lol, and yeah I really want to get onto a research assistant role but I’m unsure how to go about it really, I’m going to email my tutor in the next few days and mention it but yeah just because we have a really small department and covid seems to have messed up 90% of our research projects I just worry that this kind of thing won’t be practical next year, but I will definitely try to find one though it’s a really good suggestion, I will definitely be doing a masters first I think I’m ok with a bit more student finance and I get welsh sf so I get a pretty good deal

We found solace and strength finally knowing that we weren’t some alone in a world where everyone else never needed help or ever had a bad day. And you know what the other 2/3 of the staff did??

During my serious episodes, my writing never suffered (surprisingly) and was the one thing that remained consistent. Everything else though just faded.

No meetings, emails, or even communication with my classes. Then poof, I was back like nothing had happened. They were fairly understanding. So to answer your question about colleagues noticing...yea they might. But a good cohort will be understanding and have seen thier fair share of mood disorders and mental illness. 

One thing that is fairly difficult is that academia involves a lot of moving and very little money. So it can be difficult to build a consistent medication &amp; treatment plan.

g2lcoqr,ExplainsSocialNorms,t2_xztrr,"&gt; That implies that it's either bloated unnecessarily, or that new tasks or more of the old tasks need to be done. That said, I'm not really sure what those new administrative positions actually do,

It's a little bit of both, which is what makes defining ""administrative bloat"" so challenging.

On one hand, there are the endless VPs and deanlets making inflated salaries to do very little, and the assistants to these people who work hard for low pay but wouldn't be needed if we didn't have an Office of Useless Paper Pushing to begin with. We could easily get rid of a lot of those sorts of positions, but at most schools, only a handful of administrators make big money, and some of them have to pay that much if you don't want someone completely incompetent doing the job. 

The obvious solution is to cut the waste (thus saving at least some money) and promote from within the faculty to fill the top administrative positions whenever possible. The catch is that most faculty don't want to spend all their time begging alumni for donations and many aren't great with admin details, so finding a willing and able candidate may be challenging. I'd like to see top admin positions start going to unemployed PhDs and exploited humanities adjuncts, but fat chance of that ever happening!

On the other hand, the university's legal obligations have grown and so have students' needs. As the university serves a more diverse population, you need more staff to help students transition into college. For instance, if you have a bunch of first generation college attendees, they need more help navigating the university's byzantine bureaucracy and strange, opaque norms. In part, the problem is that the university is filling in for non-existent social services that *should* be provided by the state but aren't. Healthcare costs for faculty and staff have increased, and so have the costs of providing mental healthcare to students. 

This is the difficult part. Do you rollback regulations, at the risk of for-profit hellholes exploiting students or letting profs sexually harass students or leaving disabled students to fend for themselves? If not, you need staff for that. Do you cut student health services just because it should technically be the community in general that provides such things to all people (not just students) who need it? If so, does that mean we don't care about students who have mental or physical health problems? Do you cut programs designed to foster success among students who face greater challenges (e.g. first-gen, diverse populations)? If so, isn't that stacking the deck in favor of students with more social and economic capital?

Some of this work could probably be done by faculty and graduate/professional students (e.g. get the law school to help with compliance, assign faculty mentors for at-risk students, staff the health center with as many psych grad students and med students as legally permissable) but like...do you want to take time away from research and teaching to do that kind of thing?

It will, however, leave a “bad mark” of sorts on the department that runs the training program, since they have to report to the NIH what all their supported students have gone on to do. I would think about the motivations of this professor in giving you this advice, as he/she may not have your best interests in mind.

If it is an F31 (though it doesn’t sound like it), an early termination is not a big deal. They are happy to take the money back and know that circumstances can change. This changes a little once you are a postdoc - as the first year of an F32 would have to be paid back to the NIH if you quit the fellowship within the first year. 

But I’ve never heard of anyone being blackballed from NIH funding for moving programs or exiting funding early. 

If you’re still not sure, contact the program officer of the grant and email them directly (or ask if there’s a good time for you to call and chat for 5 minutes). You can find this person in your era commons or by a bit of clever googling with the grant number.

It's all well and good for people to say we should complain/file title IX, but the truth is, it won't make much of a difference. It will probably ruin what's left of our careers and mental health, but it won't make a difference. Plus, at least in my case, *the institute was made aware of his misconduct*. I really like the term you used to describe these kinds of people. They are truly 'psychopaths'. There is no winning with these people. The more you interact with them, the more harm you do to yourself. Change should happen at the institution level. When a complaint is made, they should do something about it. Until such change happens, there is no point in asking victims to re-traumatize themselves.  


I do believe it's important to educate others on the kind of abuse that happens in sexual harassment, and that is one of my intentions in writing my original post. No one other than myself and this man know what actually happened and I wanted that to change. If I had known what I was going through was sexual harassment when it started, I could have stopped it from derailing my career (and life?). The crazy making nature of these situations is that the abuse is hidden. At first you think you're imagining it or that you're overreacting. I just didn't know enough to recognize the abuse when it started. I hope this post will help someone in such a situation.

You can always enroll in a PhD and you will have covered many (most, actually) of the courses required prior to starting your research. In other words, it's not an extra year or two that you add in. Regardless, put yourself and your mental clarity and balance FIRST.
Best of luck.

Edit: regarding your question about your mental health as a reason for having performed below your capacities in undergrad...you not need to disclose any of that, and if you choose to do focus on NOT victimizing yourself. A quick ""I underwent some severe mental health patches in my undergrad which partly account for my performance in some courses"" should do. Right after, show how you did very well in other courses, to counterbalance and to underscore the good, not the bad.

Regarding good habits to get into that can help you: find a good system that works for you in terms of keeping up with the literature. Keep an annotated bibliography, and thematize it. Attend talks and lectures, ideally go to conferences if you can. Learn about the ""art"" of giving paper presentations and behaving like a scholar among other scholars.

I also take courses, TA, have other lab responsibilities as an RA, train and mentor undergrads, and lead volunteer efforts during this.

I have generalized anxiety disorder (I was diagnosed in college) and also have depressive episodes, and I had that all through graduate school. It can sometimes present oddly - there are no psychotic or manic episodes, but anxiety can express itself in weird nervous behaviors. I did not tell my advisor until I had to (I had a pretty bad downturn in my third year, and again in my fourth). However, it's important to note that I'm in the social sciences and both I and my advisor studied mental health, so it's possible he may have been more sympathetic than most since we both knew *exactly* how mental health can affect people.

I'd say it had a negligible effect on how people viewed me in the department (I'm not sure how many people knew), but it had a bigger impact on actually getting through the program. Transitioning from the structure of coursework in years 1-2 to the amorphous blob of comprehensive exams in years 3-4 was difficult. I went straight to grad school from college, so I had never really had to structure my own time before, and I was not good at it initially. I chose to take another year because I was struggling so much in my third and fourth that I didn't want to put additional pressure on myself, but it did mean that I had to find funding for that sixth year after my fellowship ran out (I did). I also remember the middle two years of my doctoral program as a dark memory hole - not much besides despair and agitation and painful insomnia. Ugh, I'm anxious just remembering them.

That said, I did really well on my comprehensive exams, and things got much better in years five and six, once I figured out how to order my life, got myself back into therapy, and got to work on my dissertation.

I made different choices in my job, and I disclosed my disorder to my current manager, after I built some trust up. (I work in industry.) I've also told my direct reports, too. It's actually been a positive - with my directs I've had some really open discussions about mental health which has let them open up to me more and ask for help when they need it, and with my manager, he can tell when I might be hitting a downturn and look out for me.

But I've forged relationships of trust with these people - so it really, really depends on your department, the reputation that you build with them, and the individuals' own knowledge and prejudices.

g453cl6,mafiafish,t2_kl4z9,"First of all, have you sought support from the university and/or medical professionals? I found that talking through problems and anxieties and a few weeks of anti anxiety meds helped me turn things around during the darkest days of my PhD.

Secondly, a little reality check: your life is not going to fall apart if you get a 2:1 in chemistry from Imperial, which it sounds like is the worst case scenario (other than your mental health).

You've presumably got at least one full academic year to pull things back and find more motivation Try to reach for positives, rather than run from negatives. - you'll be surprised how willing academics can be to help you if you ask them in a structured and positive way - it takes courage to admit you're struggling, but given your obvious aptitude, there's no reason you can't catch up and make a higher grade. Do you have the option of taking resits for courses you'd like to improve your grades on?

Don't feel that you can't reach your goals with a low 2:1 - I got the same and still went on to get my DPhil from Oxford after getting my mojo back during an MRes degree.

Finding some support and people who are rooting for you to turn things around, or people holding you accountable in a positive and constructive way can really help to get an alternative source of motivation other than pure passion for the course or subject. After you start seeing improvements and gain a little more confidence you may even get a little boost to motivation given the results.

A warning though, one you've probably read a hundred times - don't do a PhD unless it's a great fit for you and your passions and you like the supervisory team. There's a reason the mental health stats are so bad for PhD students and rushing into one is not to be encouraged and they're kind of all-or-nothing, you don't really get credit for 75% of a PhD like you would for 3 years' experience in industry or business - if you don't complete it, you can feel that you've wasted a chunk of your life and potential earnings.",1,2020-09-05 16:44:59,AskAcademia

What stimulates each person best may differ, and both challenge and boredom can be found in any of them.  But the level of suitability can vary.  I couldn't do admin (too much conflict) and industry, back when I was still in chem, seemed confining.

So I went on the academic track, and only found out that I had such disorders as you describe the hard way--in my first teaching job.  Thank heavens, they were supportive, and I got my feet under me.  But it took a frightening brush with collapse to do it--perfectionism, distractability, and procrastination do not play well together.  A combination of psychiatry and psychology has been keeping me in the proverbial zone ever since, all the way through tenure.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy was totally transformative on the matter of procrastination--I can't say enough good about it, because it has greatly increased my output while still making sure I don't alienate my family and friends.  In turn, we make a support network of our own.

Regardless of what you do, you'll feel those stresses in some way, so you should address them.  But the sense that you could be doing so much more, or should be, seems pretty universal.  It's not always fair to put on yourself, but you can always talk to a CBT or academic coach to see if you have any habits or in-built reflexes that work against you.  So yes, similar feelings, somewhat similar experiences, and advice that you talk to mental health professionals to figure out your best way forward with a healthy eye on your work.

Anxiety does that I suppose. These things make me meticulous but they also make me very clearly unconfident.

eg7sgg4,arschhoden,t2_290cne1p,"I will answer this one for the UK. I am an early career academic in the humanities with a PhD and a couple of fixed-term fellowships and jobs behind me. 

In short, it's major.  We don't have 'tenure' per se in the UK, people tend to refer instead to having a permanent or open-ended post. If your ambition is to be an academic (i.e. what you usually call a college professor in the US) then getting a permanent job is the first point at which you know that it's worked out for you, that you get to do the job you've spent years striving after. It means you can stop applying for temporary, poorly paid jobs that might fling you across the other side of the country, or take you to another country (in my case I have just come to the end of a one-year job that saw me commute to Germany once a week, taking up half my salary). It means you will have paid research time and a large support network of colleagues to help you publish your work and plan new projects, rather than having to do it on your own, and probably for free. 

It means the constant, constant fear that you'll never make it has finally come to an end, and you can actually start the life that your friends from school in other careers have been living for 7+ years already (i.e. buy a place, start a family, plan which city you'll live in for more than the next 2+ years). I don't have stats, but anecdotally I'd say rates of depression and anxiety are high for many people at this stage (in my case this has involved panic attacks and mild depression, I suspect only mitigated because I have a background in mental health volunteer work and I know some of the signs).  

It sounds like I'm complaining, but knew what I signed up for. However I do wish postgraduate students were given a better idea of what it's like to be an early-career academic, and how hard and soul-crushing the job search is. There is a very pernicious myth that goes something like 'if you want it enough, you'll get the job eventually'. This is bullshit, since plenty of world-class scholars are forced out of the profession because there are so few jobs and each one is just so hard to get (in my case I might see 4-5 jobs a year that I might have a shot at, each one will attract 100+ applicants, and will generate a shortlist of around 5). It makes it all the harder to see people who I know don't work as hard as me get permanent posts, or to hear stories of senior academic staff who are lazy, incompetent or abusive to their students or colleagues. I would gladly do their jobs for a third of the salary. 

What ultimately makes it workable it for me is that my wife, who is also an academic, got a permanent post two years ago and is able to support me while I keep looking for jobs. This kind of spousal (or even parental) support is very common amongst people at the early career stage. Of course this also means that I can't really take a job that's more than a few hours away because we now have a baby and I'm the primary childcarer, so I would need to be able to provide childcare fees from my salary. This is also a very common scenario though - there are lots of academic couples, since in this world you mainly socialise with colleagues, and each couple who makes it (i.e. both with permanent posts) has a story about how they managed to juggle it all.

I graduated undergrad with a 3.99 (only one A-, which was the semester where said autoimmune illness flared up really badly and put me in the hospital for a while).

Honestly I hated my classes too. I actually considered dropping out once I came to a realization that my motivation for doing well was just personal pride/achievement and a fear of failure. I only kept going because I started doing research (originally just because it's what the ""successful"" people do) and I actually ended up really liking it, thanks to a professor who gave me a lot of freedom to work on things I was interested in. I found a topic that I was passionate about and that kept me going.

I did continue to grad school and I'm planning on getting a PhD - I still dislike coursework/lecture and I still have issues with stress, motivation, and mental/physical health. But in spite of this, I'm passionate about what I do and there's nothing I'd rather be doing with my life. I hope to someday become a professor, both so I can continue do the research I love, and so I can teach and inspire students, and hopefully do what I can to make academia a less toxic/stressful environment.

However, the important point is that you need to make the decision for yourself. If a PhD won't satisfy you intellectually nor will it help you reach your career goals, there's no reason to do one. Though you have to have a realistic view of what the careers both in and out of academia are like. For example, I really like to play the guitar and compose music, possibly even more than I enjoy research -  but honestly I don't think I would enjoy the career/lifestyle of working in music even if I was successful enough to be well-off financially.

There are lots of examples and templates you can google for. They go something like

""Dear X,

Hope you are well. I am writing to ask you for a letter of reference for [what you need it for]. [insert 1-2 sentences about who you are if you are afraid they don't remember you]. [insert 1 sentence about why you're asking them if it's not obvious]. The recommendations are due by [date]. Please let me know if you'd be able to recommend me. Let me know if it's more convenient to discuss over a call.

Best,
You""

Make a template for yourself that you can copypaste into emails with minimal changes. This is a pretty formal approach that I wouldn't use with my current supervisor or whatever, but if that's what it takes to get you to send those emails, do it. As long as you're polite and concise, it doesn't matter. They will probably ask for your CV, info on work you did with them, info on whatever they're recommending you for, and, if it's grad school or a fellowship, your SOP or similar, so have those or summaries of them ready.

One thing to consider is that the department may have had someone with mental health issues in the past and it didn't go well (regardless of whether it was mental health related or not), and they can project this bias towards you.

I would encourage you to consider getting treatment if you're not, and consider filing the appropriate paperwork with the university about having a general medical condition that might interfere with your ability to attend classes, or that you may need more time. It's not really your advisor's business what you're struggling with, but you also want to protect yourself in case you have to on paper. 

While depression is a medical condition, and most people I've met in academic life struggle with mental health issues, it's iffy if this is the right arena to share them.

g27r0wh,maniaxzen,t2_ikdv7,"Oof. I can relate to a lot of this. My dad wasn't abusive, per se (there's an argument for  unintentional emotional abuse though), but I'm pretty sure he has undiagnosed borderline personality and/or bipolar (especially given our family mental health history and both his kids, myself included, having a bipolar diagnosis). He went off-the-rails any time anything triggered him my whole childhood. This was often directed at me (I was the scape-goat), so I have some *very* unhealthy issues with authority that I tend to transfer to authority figures in my life (professors, bosses, etc). Unlike you though, I don't want to be loved by them, I'm very oppositional - which is also really not good. My first instinct is to fight with anyone who tries to control me in any way, but my brain takes someone just being my teacher or my boss as trying to control me... so... lots of issues there. 

I know therapy is frustratingly slow, but it does work - over 20 years later and I'm so much healthier in pretty much every single way (even things I didn't go to therapy for, just because it's been over 20 years of working on my mental health). 

For your wanting relationships, you might want to consider trying to refocus on building relationships with your peers. Like when you notice yourself doing this, make an effort to go talk to someone else in your department instead. This is probably more difficult during the pandemic, but when this is over, set-up a pub night (if you can legally drink) or invite your classmates to a local diner. It might not make the pull go away, but it might help you refocus and still build some strong relationships. 

The other thing I've done is find a career with a very horizontal hierarchy (hello, community college!). I found it far too triggering to work in environments with strict vertical authority and hierarchy, so even when I worked in industry jobs, I would seek out companies that were more horizontal in structure (the more the place is into ""company culture"" and being ""cool"" the more I've found they lean towards coaching-style management instead of authority-style management.

It’s also a profession in which you get constant feedback on your performance, often anonymously (reviewers, student evals, etc), which can be very anxiety-provoking.

The problem was not the XX expected hours spent in lab but that it didnt correlate with success (despite ivy league place and well known lab). We had a lot of mental health issues and one attempted suicide (persons stopped eating for weeks and stopped sleeping towards the end so he could work harder). You could easily work 14h a day, but there was no point as you could get moved from your first authorship to mid-author because the PI wanted an undergrad as first author so the PI would look good in the department. Threats were for visa/GC typically or not getting a refence letter ie destroying your career. People that tried for TT and  made it to the interview after 50-100 applications, they found out the PI had written a shitty letter. And as the PI knew they were on the market they became ""technicians"" in the lab. 

It was a lot of uneccessary hard work because we had to re-invent the wheel constantly. For example the PI would hire a post doc with no  experience for the given project sometimes the equipment is in another location too...the post doc was promised a great learning experience,then arrives to the lab to start the project but there is no training and he has to set up everything on his own within 3 months or the circus starts. Sometimes the data produced by the stressed post doc wont even make sense, because the person has not established the technique and years are spent on the project until new post doc takes over and has to spend time cleaning up and then re-inventing the wheel.

 In summary, you work hard, your publication record is 1 paper/year in Impact 5-10 journal, you wont get a reference letter for a TT and probably cant even compete with your publication record ...The PI has been reported XX times but used to have 5 R01  (now maybe down to 3-4) and start ups so Department would not touch him.

*Truly* abusive professors are reprehensible.  However, ""activists"" against the ""toxic"" scientific environment invariably use tragedies (like suicide) to petition for mechanisms to *report and* *punish* anyone who might dare question *their* vision of a ""safe"" lab.

If I feel like I don't deserve my accommodations, I look to my mental health team and all of my medical documentation, and I trust that those will be a good representation of the difficulties I face.

My diagnosis may alter slightly, but none of what I have been diagnosed with is trivial and the decision to give me those labels isn't made lightly by medical professionals. They went to medical school. I didn't. ",1,2019-03-04 04:43:19,AskAcademia

If it’s something that you feel might be diagnosed (ie. an anxiety disorder) they could also benefit from connecting with accessibility/disability services. Hopefully these resources can help the student find ways to manage their anxieties, and also connect them with trained professionals who are better equipped to deal with her health in contrast to you as her professor (as you’ve expressed). 

Since she has a lot of anxiety, I would also reach out to these services yourself before approaching her as they may give you strategies on how to best bring up the subject. With the stigma of mental health, bringing it up could cause her to shut down, so finding out how to talk to her about it would help.

I found myself comparing my work or life with others a lot in my first few years of grad school (7 total, 2 for MS and 5 for PhD). Once I learned that everyone works differently and that there's nothing wrong with that, I was so much happier. I learned I worked best devoting a whole morning or afternoon to writing and then spending the other half of the day on other smaller tasks. I also worked better from a coffee shop off campus, and that I had to stop caring if people thought I was unproductive because I wasn't on campus a lot (I actually graduated before most of them, they just never actually saw me doing the work).

Adding to that idea, finding an advisor who understands that everyone can be productive in different ways is also a huge boon to your success, happiness, and mental health. My advisor didn't care if I was in campus when I didn't absolutely have to be, which allowed me to work in my own ways. As long as I turned things in on time/early and gave her please ty of notice for when I'd need feedback, I was golden in her eyes. I knew other advisors who expected their students to be on campus/in the lab 9-5 every Monday-Friday, no exceptions, and they had to run all travel time by the advisor well.in advance. This would have been stifling to me, as I work so much better if I work when I know I'll be productive and take off to a trail or for a run to reenergize if I'm feeling unproductive.

Again, drawing on my own experience, **EVERYBODY** struggles whilst doing a PhD. I have had the benefit of working in two of the top departments in my field, I worked alongside dozens of PhD students both as an RA, as a PhD student myself, as a lecturer and now in academic support services. 

I am yet to find any PhD student who enjoys the process. All of us have the same problem: It is lonesome work, it is an enormous amount of information to work with and you are constantly challenging yourself to cope with it. As soon as something in your support network changes, it can trigger an avalanche of negative self-reflection. 

A few real life examples of mental health issues without going into personal detail: 

*A close friend had two supervisor changes, she managed the first one well as it was a recognised professor at the top of the field she studied, but then he got promoted and had to assign her to a junior staff member who A: didn't understand the research topic, B: didn't have a clue about the methodology. She qualified, but only because she decided to ignore the final supervisor completely, the number of times she dragged herself up from the bottom fighting and screaming is incredible, it took her five years.*

*A young, extremely bright, PhD student in my cohort was doing great, on the surface. Then he had a sports injury, or at least that is what he told everybody. Stayed away for a year, he returned just before my Viva and we had a long night in a pub - he had suffered a mental breakdown because his mother was diagnosed with cancer and he felt he couldn't support her and do his PhD. I spoke to him recently and four years later he has a viva date.*

*A friend who is now an internationally renowned professor suffered from impostor syndrome, unable to make decisions without validation from more senior staff, one of his ideas was straight-up stolen by one of them. He reached out to wellbeing and ended up receiving counselling, best thing that could have happened to him.*

*Recently I coached (as part of my role) a very senior member of staff with my current employer. She was told she had to do a PhD by publication to retain her senior leadership role. Two years in and she is under such pressure that it is bordering on insane. After the session she immediately told her line manager that she had two options: Give her two days a week to get her PhD or drop the demand to get one. She now has two days a week to get her PhD.*

Final piece of advice (ad verbatim from my supervisor, received *after* I finished my viva voce, the plonker): **A PhD is awarded as a commendation of you managing to get through this experience.** So I will add to that: Treat it as such and look after yourself.",1,2019-02-18 15:16:15,AskAcademia

* What are your expectations for holidays and weekends? Email replies? Always ask permission to take days off? 

* Is your management style more hands-on or hands-off? And then you need to know yourself which one is better for you.

* How long does it usually take for students to graduate, and why? Some advisors hold on to producing students forever, some advisors pop people out fast, some are in the middle. 

* What are your feelings on mental health in grad school? Do you think XYZ school does a good job making a healthy environment? (or some other vague question not specifically about their lab that would give you an idea if they think ""depression is for wimps"" or ""just work through it"" attitudes are there)

For other grad students (My advisor linked me by email to students in his lab so I could get a sense of the lab environment. If they don't want to do that, I'd take that as a red flag)

* How many hours a week do you think people in the lab work? What time are the lab meetings? (saturday? 8 am? that can be very annoying)

* How easy have you found it to be to get funding/publish in this lab? (sometimes advisors take forever to turnaround paper drafts, and that delays graduation. Other times, you have to pull teeth just to buy $25 of supplies. Neither are great.)

I'm prone to anxiety/burnout and going into the PhD I've been focused on not destroying my mental health. I work in computational biology so I have the advantage of setting my own hours (I used to do intensive lab work and it was not for me). I'm also not in the US and my stipend is enough that I don't have to do lots of teaching - I do a couple of mornings a week during the semester. 

I'm currently halfway through writing my thesis, expected to finish in a few months (3 year program).

I wake up around 7-8am, get to work sometime between 9-11am. I spend my first hour in the office drinking lots of very strong coffee, reading papers and thinking about tasks for the day. Before lunch I usually spend a while doing some project organisation, editing drafts of papers or some coding task.

I take at least an hour for lunch, drink 2 cups of tea and lots of water. In the afternoon I do the most mentally intensive task for the day, something more theoretical or an annoying computer problem. Usually my brain craps out after 2-3 hours and I go on a tea break for 30 minutes. Late afternoon I wind down my main task, work on smaller problems and then do more project organisation.

 I generally leave the office about 6pm and commute home (I can't read on public transport so I chill out listening to podcasts). I spend my evenings doing regular people stuff - cook, clean, grocery shopping, chilling out with my BF. Most days I will do an hour or two of easier writing/coding/making figures in the evening.

I go to bed around midnight and mess around on my phone until 2am, because I'm an idiot who drinks too much caffeine. 

Weekly I have 4 hours of meetings, and I run a coding club for a few hours a week. Weekends I do chores, a bit more work and maybe a hike.

Have you tried to talk to someone ? psychologist, counselor, your supervisors (although I'm assuming they don't really care anymore). This is very likely to help you going through that difficult phase, which is, considering your message, a much bigger priority than thinking about your publication or your diploma.

It's easy when you are in the lab running assays, ordering supplies, or coordinating whatever but when you're writing or doing analysis -for me at least- it's hard to do.

&gt; Have you been lucky with PhD and postdoc advisors?

I started researching doctoral advisors for more than a year prior to applying. Not just their work, but also the kind of person they are. For my particular advisor, I watched his online lectures and saw how he interacted with questions, and then I emailed back and forth for several months. I knew he would be a good advisor even before I applied. 

For postdoc, I was very social in grad school and had met him multiple times at conferences. So that was an easy choice.

Stuff like sexism, harassment, racism? No. Being born a white male has advantages there.

money? Not really I made sure to plan ahead, and I saved up money before going to grad school. Also I took my girlfriend with me. She got a job in the same city, and we always made sure to be saving money.

Dead end projects? Yeah, of course I had dead end projects. But they weren't the only one I was working on. I knew there would be potential for me to not be able to figure out a proof. So I was always working on 2-3 different ones, and I would make progress on at least one. 

imposter syndrome? No. My advisor helped me set realistic goals and split large projects into smaller tasks that could be accomplished in days rather than months. I could always see at the end of the week where I started and what I accomplished. I understood it was a marathon and not a sprint. I didn't need to see the entire progress all at once.

 &gt; And how did you engineered your luck?

I made sure I knew what I was getting into. I had an advisor in undergrad who really helped me understand the hardships that came with a PhD, and I prepared for them.

I also mentor a bunch of undergrads, and some of them have had really shitty experiences with professors dealing with disabilities. Our student disabilities office and support services office do a great job advocating for students when they learn about these things, but there's definitely a lot of judgement about anxiety disorders. I picked an advisor who I knew would be accepting of my issues, but I also think a lot of the PIs here would be terrifying to explain that productivity was low due to mental health issues. I like to hope that my success and openness about my issues can help change that, but I do fear that being too open might kick me in the butt one day for employers who don't want to deal with it. Luckily I'm not trying to do tenure-track.

ei6ts7k,Vaporware371,t2_q3512,"The literature review places your work in the context of past research that's been done. Let's say your thesis follows the following format:

1. Description of the problem you're trying to solve/explore/research.
2. History of other attempts at the problem, with descriptions of their success and shortcomings.
3. Your approach, and what it improves upon.
4. Your results/conclusion.

The literature review would be #2. What have others already done? What have they shown, and what gaps remain in the research?

To do this properly, you have to step into the reader's shoes a bit, and anticipate some of their questions. Speaking to your example, what I might be wondering:

* What are other examples of mental-health apps (or computer programs) in the literature?
* What is in the literature about people who can't afford treatment?

In terms of types of sources, you ideally want to cite the primary source (this is true in general) for any experiment. Also, you r*eally* want to trace your thread of thought back (if possible) to the first example of this idea in the literature. Were people doing this kind of work in the 1950s? 1920s? 1820s? For your app example, you'd be hard-pressed not to include Dr.  Weizenbaum's work in the 1960s. And then you go from there.

Obviously it is space permitting: you don't need to reference every paper in the field. However, *if every paper you read seems to cite a particular article/experiment*, it probably merits inclusion, because it is clearly important to the field. While you can be somewhat sparse when going through the history of your work, you should be thorough regarding the recent developments in the field. It is ok to ""mass-cite"" sets of very similar publications, in the name of being thorough, as long as you don't paint with too broad a brush.

Going back to the concept of anticipating the reader. You never know whose hands something you write will fall into. It's easy to get comfortable with your research group and thesis advisor: they will have read many of the same articles as you, and shared many conversations with you. When someone reads your paper, you have no idea what background knowledge they're coming in with. In particular, you need to anticipate:

* Someone who is completely new to the field. What reading do they need to do in order to get up to speed in the subject matter? All of those sources should be described in the literature review.
* Someone who is currently doing work in the field at another group/lab, and has put out recent publications. If you listed publications from 9 researchers who are active in your field, and you happen to meet the 10th researcher (or he happens to be your advisor's friend), you are going to find yourself in an awkward conversation as to why they weren't included in your sources.",1,2019-03-10 04:56:52,AskAcademia

ej31xoo,FJRabbit,t2_eybn9,"Dude I feel you. I’m doing a PhD now (with attendance issues of my own), and although I wasn’t in MH inpatient recently, I was in one for 8 months and essentially came out of it one month before moving alone to a new country (UK) and starting my undergrad degree. So I guess I have both of those things but not together. 

I guess what’s most important is, how are you doing now? Was the treatment helpful? Or, at least, have you figured out what the issues are and some steps towards solving them? 

I get from your post that you seem to be apprehensive of going back partly because of shame. I understand that, but at the same time, you shouldn’t feel that way ideally. I’ll bring out the cliche “what if it was a physical illness” argument (forgive me) - you were unwell enough to require inpatient stay in a hospital. They don’t give that for no good reason or people who aren’t really ill (especially in the UK - I’ve spent several hundred hours with mental health crisis teams since but never been admitted again). The fact that you want to and are planning to go back at all is amazing for a start. But you can’t go from being in hospital 24/7 for a few weeks to just charging at work again, and you’re not expected to, same as with a physical illness. 


You need to have healthcare plans in place first of all: How are you going to work towards feeling better? You need a main plan and all the adjustments to your life you need to implement bit by bit. Then, you need to work with your university, and with your supervisor(s), as they’re the ones (other than yourself) who are going to ensure your success. Are there any adjustments that the university can make, any helpful services they can offer? 

With your supervisor, have you considered letting them know of your fears of going back? Maybe you could set up a plan with them, some goals to achieve that aren’t “start up immediately at 60mph and 60 hours a week”. You need to not feel ill again and get worse for a start, but you also need to recover from what you’ve just been through. I’ll say it again, it’s not nothing, and it’s not worth dismissing. 

If you work with healthcare, the university and its services, as well as your supervisor(s), you should be able to find a way back to work that works for you. You’ll need an adjustment period where you get back up to speed and maybe suffer a few dips, but beyond that I hope you start to feel like a regular old PhD student again!

However, I do think you need to be aware of the negative aspects before signing up for a program. I genuinely love what I do, but I have still struggled with mental health problems in graduate school.

As to the hours: I regularly work 11-13 hour days. As in, I get to my office/lab around 8-9 and leave between 10pm to midnight. I am not being forced to stay for that amount of time, but I have deadlines to meet and work that has to be done. As a graduate student, you are in charge of your own time. I have to run experiments, analyze my experiments, read papers constantly (I need to know what has been done in my topic, what is currently being done in my topic, and what is current surrounding my topic - where is the research going?). I also have to take courses until I am finished with the course requirements, so I have that homework and studying on top of my research responsibilities. Neither research or coursework will slow down for the other. You may even have to TA or teach courses, grade papers, hold office hours - all rewarding things, but all giant time sucks.

As to the mental health aspect: Academia goes hand in hand with rejection. You will have research meetings with your advisor and will regularly have negative feedback. Without negative feedback, you will never grow; however, after some time, it will build and become increasingly discouraging. You will have papers rejected from journals, maybe even rejected from conferences. You will have weeks where you cannot meet all or any of your deadlines and your advisor will push you to get your work done. There will be times when the research method you were following will be incorrect and you will have to start all over again. You will hit a wall at some point, it has even been named the ""three year slump"".  

I would encourage you only to do a PhD if it is something you very much want to do, rather than an escape from something you don't want to do. Without using a doctorate to follow your passion, the negatives will far outweigh the positives. ",1,2019-03-18 19:14:45,AskAcademia

One professor erroneously forwarded a grad fac thread to the grad student list serv, and that had a really profound impact on the cohort. 

The message was describing a student that had just graduated. The content of the message was negative, and discussed the student as a slow, stubborn learner that never took advice. Apologies were made for this, but it really clued in the students as to how faculty were thinking about us.

dituyt8,engelthefallen,t2_6c2hf,"It is not insensitive though to value your time.  I know that is why my advisor will not take me on.  We could make things work, but the comes becomes is that really fair.  He turned down all students for two years as he is stretched thin himself, so to take me on for a PhD while rejecting everyone else kind enters into an area where it has to be asked is it fair to others if I advance.  To his credit, my advisor did lay out exactly what I needed to do to continue to a PhD, and that if I did not meet those goals I would not be able to advance and he would not likely take me on.  What he also did, that you may consider, is he advised me to talk to my other professors.  His view was just because he does not wish to take me on, I should not rule out working with people in my department if my heart was set on staying.  He also offered to write me a letter of recommendation for other programs, including his former advisor.

Something that has not been mentioned, is if the issues with Sarah are mental, it may be in her best interest to cut her off for her own good.  We do not talk about it, but academia has a rate of mental health issues that can lead to negative health effects or suicide.  If she is struggle now with what looks like comps and the thesis, the dissertation prep work is far more stressful and intensive and pushes some well adjusted students to their limits.  Then if she wanted to teach, there is the job hunt that seems even more stressful than getting the PhD.  

Comparing my situation and this one, I think the biggest takeaway is my advisor tries to set parameters from the start, which may be something that may be helpful for you to do.  Lay out early what is expected if students want to continue on, what is expected of students in their coursework, and other projects and make sure it is known what happens if they fail to meet that goal.  It sounds like disability services has done this to some degree, but in general it seems like this is a good practice to do in general to avoid situations like this where you wonder if you are doing enough.

Finally I have no idea what area you work in, but I do education and had to do the class on testing.  A large part of this class was what is an accommodation and what is a modification.  What Sarah seems to want at this point is modifications, or changes to the nature of the program.  Whereas accommodations should put a student on a level playing field by negating many of the aspects of their disability, modifications change the playing field.  Usually modifications change the standards, material to be covered or projects that are required.  The main different on a practical level, is accommodations expect grading and learning outcomes to remain unchanged, and whereas modifications directly change the learning outcomes and standards of learning. Looking at what Sarah is requesting she is requesting that her learning outcomes and mastery standards be adjusted, which leaves the area of accommodations and enters into modifications.  Modifications usually are reserved for extreme cases, like where a student with dyscalculia does not do the same homework as his classmates when they start multiplication.  Their work will remain in addition and subtraction.  Or a student with dyslexia may be excused from doing a book report.  College students however are expected to meet the standards the college sets for all students.  Sometimes the term academic adjustment is used in college settings, but these are modifications that do not changes the standards.  Knowing where the line is between the two, should help ease the worry that you did not do enough to provide reasonable accommodations and possibly explain to Sarah why you cannot alter her grades.  She has the right to request reasonable things to allow her to do her best, but nowhere in the disability rights is there the right to a degree, or admissions to an advanced program if she cannot meet the standards.  The responsibility is on her to figure out what she needs and how to meet the standards.  

Good luck with this.  As for my struggles, they set me back, but in a way, they also helped me a lot.  A got to take time to really spend time working with my area of focus and learn secondary skills to better prepare me for research to attack a complex problem in my field that would lead to a great dissertation down the line.  Also the time I spent recovering allowed a few people to get professorships and grants doing similar research to what I want to work on.  So while I would love to be teaching now with a PhD, the longer road may prove to be the better one as the work I moving into is far more interesting and of greater value to my field.",1,2017-06-13 03:49:59,AskAcademia
ditzp1n,SnowblindAlbino,t2_7ild5,"&gt; So if somebody flunks their thesis, they don't graduate from college? 

Unless they've completed a second major, no. Generally speaking they will come back for a 9th semester. Not all of our majors require a thesis, but the ones that do tend to be the more rigorous/challenging and all of them require a C or better on the thesis to graduate. There's quite a bit of variation in quality between departments though too...what ""counts"" as good work in one might not even rate a C in another, as the standards are set by each department.

&gt;I doubt most people are suited to or need to write a 60+ page piece of original research.

Most people are are likely not, and most of our graduates (institutionally) don't have a thesis requirement as the largest majors (psych, biol, business) have capstones that are project-based. But I also have the luxury of teaching at a fairly selective liberal arts college, so in general our students are going to be stronger than the general population at State U., and my department has built its major curriculum around research skills so the thesis is really scaffolded over three years. Of the small number who fail annually I'd say 90% do so not because they weren't capable, but because they either fucked up (blew off assignments, didn't put in the hours, didn't take the early stages seriously) or ran into some sort of personal challenge (illness, mental health, family tragedy, etc.) that make it impossible. The rest, they pretty much do product 50+ page pieces of original research and have been doing so since we established the requirement in the 1980s (though honestly the product is far better now than it was even 20 years ago).

As to the need? It's the capstone of our major, the point of knowledge creation and synthesis. I wouldn't want to work in a department that *didn't* have a thesis. I did two myself as an undergrad (double majors) and they were the most rewarding parts of my college education, and prepared me well for grad school. More importantly, our alumni report almost universally similar results-- the theses get them into grad school, get them job offers, teach them skills they need in post-collegiate settings, etc. ",1,2017-06-13 05:51:06,AskAcademia
eex14a1,needlzor,t2_43i1t,"As a counterpoint to the options discussed in /r/Professors, I was in a similar situation as that student due to some mental health problems that I took some time to figure out. My funding fell through, so I took a break of one year and went to work (using some internship scheme) and saved as much as I could, then came back for a year to work on my PhD. I ran out of money again so I took a teaching associate position in another Uni, and worked on my thesis in parallel. It was long, laborious, and hard but I ended up finishing and successfully passed my viva last Friday. 

I think taking a year off is a superior option because it gave me some time to reflect on whether I actually liked academia (which I did) and it also took my mind off University work for a while. It also gave me an out, as I could have just stayed in the company I was working in and just completed a Masters' thesis. 

Almost everybody in my university was trying to convince me to quit though. A few of them as a reverse psychology thing. Most others because they thought I wouldn't finish. Thankfully I am terrible at following advice, and I tend to be very tenacious. ",1,2019-01-25 11:12:45,AskAcademia

It might be current circumstances, it might be false association (are you really trading health for work, or do they just correlate?), but it might really be that you sincerely do not feel your work matters. Some questions, then, are why doesn't it matter? Can it matter? What does matter? It might be the case that you can take a turn and research something that does matter. Or, alternatively, maybe what you think matters is just not a candidate for you to research.  
  
Another question is the kind of mattering. I'd like to propose inherent vs. Instrumental value. In this case, the question is, even if the research doesn't matter in itself, what does it do for you and for your life?  
  
Leaving Academia can be hard, and people need to be brave to do it. It's the right choice for people. But I think asking about what matters to you and in what ways is a good place to start.

gdrnybl,ccots,t2_od1qf,"These ups and downs are very common in academic work - and in other self-directed, creative pursuits (authors, artists etc). The key difference with industry in our case is that you don’t carry the weight of whether the work is “worth it” (whatever that means). It is natural to second-guess yourself, and to fall into the trap of familiarity breeding contempt. After several years of constant exposure, it’s inevitable that the ideas you were excited about seem mundane. 

The way I have coped with this is to periodically review my ideas and projects and ask myself if this the most impactful and interesting thing I can work on. The time and place for all things pass: is that the case for the things I started several years ago?

It hard to evaluate this yourself sometimes, and from what you write you might not be in the best emotional place to do so. Find a trusted colleague (anywhere) with whom to do a thorough review: explain your current project, where you see them going, what you ultimately hope to achieve and how you will get there. Make new plans. Work on important things.

gdu4n72,iamshada,t2_75md0lls,"I totally relate to what you are experiencing. I believe it is an issue with setting priorities and boundaries stemming from a distorted perception of self-value in a highly competitive unsupportive work environment. As academics, I noticed we tend to prioritize our work over our mental health and this is probably because we place our value and identify on our achievements in academia. We also find it extremely hard to set boundaries for the same reason. What happens then is what happened with you, me and I am sure unfortunately many others, issues with mental health, chronic exhaustion and burn out especially when the work environment does not care about your mental health as much as getting work done and having their  reputation enhanced. As humans, our health and well-being should always be our main priority. However, it is unfortunate that academics never discuss that till they get these health issues and reflect then. Even if you hear stories, you never think it will happen to you. Some get them while doing their master, some while doing their phd and many others get them after, like you. But, it eventually happens. We have to raise awareness of this issue in our field and prevent it from happening to others.

It is great that you have access to therapy and working on your health. I think this is the most important step to take. Working on your identity, life purpose and value will bring a new life outlook. I do think that the current work environment is contributing to your health issues, but are not the main cause. The tendencies we have in the structure of our personalities can be taken advantage of in other work environments as well, probably not as much as academia does. Awareness here is key, as placing importance in health and what truly brings happiness to you in the field (ex. curiosity fulfillment) as well as finding your value in other aspects of your life should be what matter here. Also, it is important to learn how to set boundaries and when to say no and take a break when needed.

ge060rs,EnthusiasticHamster,t2_18r8pk,"Right, lots of stuff to break down and this isn't going to be an answer but a list of ideas and my thoughts. 

Firstly, don't worry about the stigma of quiting a PhD program. As you've seen already, industry won't hold it against you and your friends/family will understand. So if you aren't quitting due to the stigma, don't worry about it. 

However, I'm an optimist at heart and I think there's a range of things to be done to help you out. 

Firstly, do your supervisors/Uni know how bad it is? I don't mean this to infer you're an idiot but some supervisors will filter out your personal issues when you tell them or downplay them. My old supervisor, I would have to tell him quite bluntly when I wasn't ok. He honestly cared and was nice but I needed to tell him directly when i needed help, otherwise he would think I was telling him just to keep him informed. Both my undergrad and PhD uni's provide additional support, both for mental health and for studies. By telling them, you can set the machine into action for help. And with mental health stigma in academia, most of us are like swans. Graceful and elegant on top of the water and frantically kicking underneath, good for you to acknowledge this. 

It sounds like you work best with SMART objectives (it's an acronym of essentially, small, progressive, achievable targets) and that's the way most of us work. There needs to be a balance of the stuff led by your supervisor and yourself. PhDs are meant to be independent research but that's not realistic in 1st yr and I don't know many who can say that in 2nd yr. My big objective (I'm now a postdoc but that's just more paperwork, significant less thesis) is to develop a new catalyst for a big industry purpose. my objectives on friday where take a reaction off, fix the glovebox, ask the tech's for more acetone, have (socially distanced) lunch with a friend, have a meeting, continue to learn python. Though I didn't do all of these things (damn glovebox) it feels good to tick off each of these things. And each thing steadily furthers my research or my health. It's not possible to answer your thesis question in a day so just chip away at it. My objectives for tomorrow include, put a reaction on, do some analysis, fix the glovebox, go to group meeting. 

Personally I think you need to be a bit of an arse if you want to keep you on your PhD programme. You need to stick up for yourself and drag each into a meeting to make them realise your position. Many supervisors will just trust you to be ok. So before you quit, please tell them. Drag them, kicking and screaming into a Zoom meeting room and tell them precisely how bad it is. 

Finally COVID, COVID has put a lot of stress on the system and on personel and Uni's have delegated their responsibilities to specific departments. Some Uni's are handling it better than overs but I'm glad you've found a Job which is safe. For PhD, you should already have had a meeting about the predicted impact to your work and how to navigate that. you should also be able to change that stratergy when you need to. If you feel physically unsafe due to the working environment, you need to tell your supervisor and/or health and safety team (typically at Uni this is building specific).

Now to the nhuts and bolts. When you report this you are going to be asked for evidence. Once you've decided to report it, accept that providing that evidence is part of the deal.

If you're providing evidence you need to be realistic about the outcome; your landlord is going to get kicked off their course. You will likely be threatened with the same. *HOWEVER*- if you go in presenting this from the start as your landlord manipulating you into it through rent, this becomes a student welfare issue as well. And that, in many way, tells you the order of operations here:


1. Refer yourself to student welfare. Explain the manipulation that you are being made a victim of. Explain your mental health background. Make sure they know the whole situation.
2. Provide any evidence you can that your landlord has been leveraging you this way.
3. Anticipate a collapse of your relationship with your landlord - explore alternative accommodation arrangements, and - where possible - see if student welfare are able to help. This is going to be hugely variable from universities to university, let alone country by country.
4. With student welfare engaged, report the academic misconduct. At this point the welfare team should be able to act alongside you, or at least provide some support or even representation.

Got my Master's early this summer and had a couple PhD positions lined up (really cool international field work) but they fell through due to covid. Couldn't get a job in my field despite asking to as many as possible, and with the world the way it is I found no other PhD opportunities. 

Finally I got a job as a vet assistant they made me nearly kill myself, and that's not hyperbole. I had to quit for my own sake and watched the reminding of my thousands in savings drop below $500, which is not enough to even pay rent. Couldn't get unemployment because my teaching contract ended, and that doesn't qualify. Neither does quitting a job for mental health, unless you can afford a lawyer.

I was lucky enough to pick up a part time job as an adventure tour guide. I absolutely love it, and even part time I'm making the same if not more money than the shit wages I got as a TA. I'm now considering a career change, because I'm not sure I can handle the stress of academia on top of the horrible changes that are sure to come in academia post-covid.

I don't have much advice other than to say keep at it. Stretch your savings as much as you can. Now is the time to ask friends and family for help... Forego Christmas presents for rent assistance if you can. Check out your local food bank, that's kept me fed for nearly nothing. Do what you can to keep yourself alive until one of those applications goes through! Find something freelance part time that can at least help with rent. I'd try Uber, food delivery, tutoring, or dog walking on Rover. It's not much but it buys time.

Good luck!

djz1dmz,majorshake,,"It was pretty intense most days - I worked afternoons/evenings only for a tutoring agency doing homework help for high school English students (luckily, I had an office students would come to, instead of going to people's homes). Typical day was 9-1 study, then take a short break and prepare for work, then work 3.30 (had to leave uni at 2.30) until between 7-9 (depending on students).

One issue was that I never could get on a roll with studying - I'd have to leave halfway through doing something to go to work. I missed out on a lot of optional but important stuff at uni (reading groups, etc) and I didn't have time to do any research on the side that could result in a publishable paper or two. Because of this, I also always felt like I was falling behind, so I basically didn't take a day off for a year and a half. It didn't help that my supervisor's idea of helping me improve is telling me to ""work harder and go out less"".

The second issue comes out of the first - because of working all the time, I stopped seeing people, and I stopped taking care of my body which took a pretty serious toll on my health, both mental and physical.

I think overall, it's possible to work up to 15 hours while doing a Master's degree, while avoiding some of the issues I'd had. You need to be prepared for it though, and know what you want out of it - don't let things get in the way.

When I switched to working full-time I was at the point where the heavy intellectual lifting was already done - I was just writing at that point, and I'd already had a handle on my work. 

If you're good at managing your time and if you have a supportive supervisor, you'd be fine - however, you need to make sure you keep on top of the work, and don't procrastinate. I did it - it kinda sucked (ok, it really sucked), but it's doable.

gbdhbpf,manova,t2_35w8d,"&gt; Research (according to me) can only be done by people who're passionate about the subject, with a good grasp of the subject matter, and high creativity.

There are plenty of people publishing research that don't really care about research and are not particularly engaged in their topic.  They publish research because it is their job and they are doing the thing required by their job.  While I have known some really, really smart people who were excellent researchers, I think the underlying qualities that are common for the best researchers are that they are good writers and good at salesmanship. 

My friends in industry get moved from project to project.  They are not doing research because their passion for the subject, but because they have the right skill set to do their job which is to produce research.  I currently work at a smaller university where teaching is more of a priority.  I would wager at least half of the faculty I work with would be just as happy to never publish another paper again.  They find more fulfillment in teaching or doing administrative tasks. 

All of that being said, if being in their field is affecting your mental health, then it may be time to look elsewhere.  I started in chemistry and while I was pretty good in the lab, I just hated it and could not imagine myself doing it for the rest of my life.  I can remember literally sitting down with the university catalog and looking at every major trying to figure out if there was something else I could do. 

There are two ways to approach this.  Complete your degree but look for employment outside of physics.  Computer programming, finance, or analytics are some examples of fields that would appreciate your strong math background and often recruit outside of their fields.  You can also think of non-research jobs within physics such a being a teacher or science editor/writer/journalism/etc.  The other is to change your major, but you really want to think about how much that would set you back.",1,2020-11-06 18:56:31,AskAcademia

Seriously: I know too many people who completed Ph.D.s then spent 5-10 years as adjuncts hoping to land a TT job. Few of them did, and all of them ended up 35 or 40 years old with no savings, no house, etc.

Not OP, but what would you say to somebody who is *already* in their mid, arguably late 20's, and already has no savings and has never had a job or gone even to undergaduate college yet due to a bad home life?

I'm immensely enamored with Mesoamerican (Aztec, Maya, etc) history, archeology, and culture, and have pretty much spent the past 4 years researching that on my own, to the point where I regularly make multi-page, sourced posts on various topics from geopolitics, urbanism, agriculture, etc, such as [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtefactPorn/comments/gprn3j/an_aztec_bath_recently_uncovered_with_faint/fro8bfh/?sort=top) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HumankindTheGame/comments/jo2a3m/since_the_franks_got_reworked_culture_card_art_i/) It feels sort of dumb and conceited to say this, but I already feel somewhat connected to the field, as due to those posts and interactions with researchers and specialists, I have (informal to semiformal) connections and regular interactions with a few already online.

I bring all this up to say that while I am aware of how absurdly competitive academic fields and related jobs are, and how inadvisable it is for even people going into school 8+ years before I would be even if I went in a few months, I also don't really have anything else to pursue. I'm in the US, i'd be paying for undergraduate courses and would likely need to take out a loan no matter what, and there's not any other fields or careeers I have an interest in. I also have various mental health and more importantal physical disabilities, so even if I were to want to go into a trade or manual labor or something, I'm not sure I could.

Would you realistically say I have anything to lose by going for it? It seems dumb without a plan B, but I'm sort of not even in a position to have a plan B to begin with, so no matter what I do I'd be risking being in my 30's with nothing to my name.... to be clear here, i'm less asking to be convinced to go for it, so much as I am seeking to be convinced *out* of it, or really be given any sort of guidance or input at all.

It's also worth noting here I suppose that I don't actually have an interest in being a professor or teaching, and I guess I see acadamia more a means to an end then anything else: I just want to meaingfully contribute to the field in terms of research, have contacts and connections with researchers for the sake of my own knowledge, and especially further public knowledge and apperciation and access. To that end, I'm most interested in Digitization, Archival and Conservation work, and Museum curation stuff. 

My understanding is at least the latter is still fiercely competitive, but i'm not sure if the former 3 things are as competitive or are even typical things that most people mean when they say ""Academic jobs"". My dream job would be spearheading a digiization and public access initiative for a museum collection, opening up scans, photos, and 3d scans of pieces not in copyright to the public online, like the Metropolituian Musem's open access policy and collaboration with Wikimedia. Accessing and preseriving high resolution images of various topics and subjects, from marketing and promo images and concept art of games, to of historical sites and art pieces, etc is pretty much my only other big hobby, and it's something I think is pretty important..

ee9zs5g,middledeck,t2_6pauh,"There is substantial empirical evidence that people in academia (as well as other fields) tend to grossly exaggerate how many hours they work. I know I will get substantial flak for this statement, but people saying they consistently work 60-80 hours a week are full of shit. 

The amount of time required to do a PhD varies tremendously by field. I'm not an engineer, and can't answer questions related to your field, but I can tell you that I don't work nearly that many hours, and never have throughout my PhD training, and I am considered by my peers to be productive and recently landed a full-time tenure-track position. 

The job market is BAD for PhDs generally. It's better for STEM and some social science fields (see my flair for an example of a field with a candidate:position ratio close to 1.00), especially if you want to go into industry. 

Most programs will limit the number of hours you're allowed to work in the lab to 20-30. This leaves plenty of time to get your coursework done and work on your own research. 

Doing a PhD does affect many people's mental health simply because it is seriously mentally exhausting, from coursework to comps, and especially the dissertation. It's taxing. You don't want to start if you don't have your head in the right place. I had to take a semester off during the dissertation (not uncommon) and it helped me get in the head space to finish. 

The people saying you can't have a normal life and do a PhD are simply wrong. I did my M.A./Ph.D. in 6 years while bartending off and on and maintaining a healthy, active social life. It can be done, you just have to be very good at time management and prioritizing tasks. The more you allow yourself to have a life outside the lab/office, the better your mental health will be. 

Honestly, I'd recommend not doing a PhD unless you're 100% certain this is what you want to do for the next 30-40 years. There are loads of other career options that allow you to do what you want, though few of them offer the flexibility of schedule and autonomy of a PhD, which is what many of us were attracted to when we decided to commit ourselves to the doctorate.

Professors talk and I know this from experience,e so the idea here is to do what is best for you, which is to get your degree with as few obstacles as possible. If the committee brings up mental health or your interaction with the supervisory team during the meeting, you should indicate your concerns in a polite and non-confrontational manner. If there is a specific person on your committee with whom you have a better rapport, I would suggest you seek them out and speak to them one on one and see if they have some idea. Often advisors and professors find it easier to talk to in no-pressure situations as they don't want to speak negatively of one of their colleagues in front of other colleagues.

There was a Professor in our department who used to cut the hourly wage of his international Ph.D. students (he knew they won't retaliate like American or PR) if the work was not up to his expectations or if the students made mistakes such as grading errors etc. However, his students started speaking to other students, and over 2 years the word had reached other Professors and the department head, and ultimately this Professor was ultimately fired.

**​ Here is my story**

I got into my Ph.D. field due to various personal reasons that outweighed my academic interests in pursuing a Ph.D. Additionally, my master's advisor pursued and encouraged me to do the Ph.D., and I believed in my personal academic abilities.

My Advisor is nice and friendly, however, he lets me do my own thing which is not something I am very fond of. There is no structure or boss-employee dynamic. I receive little to no mentorship or advice, which makes most of my work completely based on my limited knowledge. To make things worse my advisor is also not very familiar with my area of research so I do not get that advice or guidance that you might get from an experienced mentor. And this area of research is something my advisor is deeply interested in getting into, so it is not something I brought up or dragged him into.

I was frustrated with this aspect and I became aware that my work was substandard by attending conferences and seminars in my area. I realized the ability to grow in my field with my current advisor is limited. I further realized this while doing an internship in my area of research this fall.

And for better or worse the COVID-19 situation has put most of our grants on hold and my funding is ending next semester. All this motivated me to give my prelims in November and I might end up graduating between May-August 2021. So it would mean I would complete my Ph.D. in less than 3 years. I sincerely wanted to stay and do more work at my advisor's lab but I am not sure how feasible that will be.

At this point I am assuming, the best-case scenario will be if I can get a full-time job or postdoc. I was expecting to grow and become better in my field during my Ph.D. but unfortunately, that did not happen and I feel I grew very little since receiving my master's.  I can't legitimately pursue academia with the few papers I have, so a postdoc might be good but I am sure the hiring folks will be skeptical about my Ph.D. too.

eea2uag,angsty_throwaway,t2_c03fg,"I left with a master's from the STEM phd program I was in due to a soured relationship with my advisor, basically saying I wasn't publishing enough in the two years I was there. He was a young guy really trying to propel his career, so that's probably why. He was also not liked by many of his students and others in the department. He also micromanaged my teaching and research hours. When I deviated he yelled and berated me so loud it could be heard down the hall. I also loathe teaching and that was my assistantship for all my time there. 

I believe that the advisor-advisee relationship is one of the most important parts of the phd process, and if it goes south it will be really tough to get through. My soured realtionship resulted in the dredging up of old mental health problems.

Take this with a grain of salt because most of the people in my program since it's inception many many decades ago only a handful left with a master's or quit. People like me are the anomaly, but make sure you choose your advisor very carefully.",1,2019-01-17 16:00:20,AskAcademia

Not OP, but what would you (and /u/SnowBlindAlbino, since they touch on this too with "".... ~20 years of one's potential lifetime earnings wasted? Seriously: I know too many people who completed Ph.D.s then spent 5-10 years as adjuncts hoping to land a TT job. Few of them did, and all of them ended up 35 or 40 years old with no savings, no house, etc.) 

say to somebody who is *already* in their mid, arguably late 20's, and already has no savings and has never had a job or gone even to undergaduate college yet despite graduating high school with good grades, due to a bad and dysfunctional home situation?

I'm immensely enamored with Mesoamerican (Aztec, Maya, etc) history, archeology, and culture, and have pretty much spent the past 4 years researching that on my own, to the point where I regularly make multi-page, sourced posts on various topics from geopolitics, urbanism, agriculture, etc, such as [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtefactPorn/comments/gprn3j/an_aztec_bath_recently_uncovered_with_faint/fro8bfh/?sort=top) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HumankindTheGame/comments/jo2a3m/since_the_franks_got_reworked_culture_card_art_i/) It feels sort of dumb and conceited to say this, but I already feel somewhat connected to the field, as due to those posts and interactions with researchers and specialists, I have (informal to semiformal) connections and regular interactions with a number already online.

I bring all this up to say that while I am aware of how absurdly competitive academic fields and related jobs are, and how inadvisable it is for even people going into school 8+ years before I would be even if I went in a few months, I also don't really have anything else to pursue. I'm in the US, i'd be paying for undergraduate courses and would likely need to take out a loan no matter what, and there's not any other fields or careeers I have an interest in. I also have various mental health and more importantal physical disabilities, so even if I were to want to go into a trade or manual labor or something, I'm not sure I could.

Would you realistically say I have anything to lose by going for it? It seems dumb without a plan B, but I'm sort of not even in a position to have a plan B to begin with, so no matter what I do I'd be risking being in my 30's with nothing to my name.... to be clear here, i'm less asking to be convinced to go for it, so much as I am seeking to be convinced *out* of it, or really be given any sort of guidance or input at all.

It's also worth noting here I suppose that I don't actually have an interest in being a professor or teaching, and I guess I see acadamia more a means to an end then anything else: I just want to meaingfully contribute to the field in terms of research, have contacts and connections with researchers for the sake of my own knowledge, and especially further public knowledge and apperciation and access. To that end, I'm most interested in Digitization, Archival and Conservation work, and Museum curation stuff (though I would be ecstatic to doing archeology or epigraphy or anything else with Mesoamerica too)

My understanding is at least the latter is still fiercely competitive, but i'm not sure if the former 3 things are as competitive or are even typical things that most people mean when they say ""Academic jobs"" (which ties into comments you, /u/sirophiuchus and /u/lucianbelew have made). My dream job would be spearheading a digiization and public access initiative for a museum collection, opening up scans, photos, and 3d scans of pieces not in copyright to the public online, like the Metropolituian Musem's Open Access Policy and collaboration with Wikimedia to upload their photos of pieces there. Accessing and preseriving high resolution images of various topics and subjects, from marketing and promo images and concept art of games, to of historical sites and art pieces (I probably have some of the largest digital collections of art from some obscure artists whose work was never published commercially I've spent a lot of time collecting from various sources), etc is pretty much my only other big hobby, and it's something I think is pretty important.

I wouldn't even mind it not dealing with Mesoamerican pieces or collections in particular for such a job, or it being a particularly large archive or insutiton i'd be doing digitization work or general archive mangement etc at, it's not like i'm in a position to be picky.",1,2020-11-15 09:31:30,AskAcademia

But my experience was shitty. I had my first real bipolar episode. This was before my 2nd year of graduate school and the university therapist suggested that I take a year of absence. I was told that I could leave but I wouldn’t recieve funding so I literally couldn’t afford to do it. 

Coincidentally, my thesis advisor was abusive. I was already in a bad place while trying to control a stew of meds. I was told to take leave in December but I didn’t. And by february my bipolar disorder grew into full blown psychosis, suicide attempt, and PTSD. At that point, I didn’t have a choice to take the leave...I was being forced out. Once I was in the hospital, I took an incomplete for my courses. I knew I would not be able return for August term or receive funding for it so I mastered out in hopes of using the degree to find a job. But after everything that had happened, I didn’t mind leaving. I was already considering and I even managed to get a few PhD apps in.

But then COVID turned the world upside down. I left the hospital as they couldn’t hold me as originally planned. But I still had almost daily virtual appointments. And when I retuned home, I was lucky enough to get a few accommodations and extensions from the university and department. So while I was still (virtually) hospitalized, I got a new thesis committee and finished my original thesis in a month. I also managed to get my incomplete courses turned into completes. I formally received my Master’s at the end of this past summer term and have been adjuncting since then. It was the hardest thing I ever done and I still don’t think I recovered.

I was accepted, by some miracle, into a new PhD program. I deferred for a year and have instead been adjuncting while getting used to medication and recovering. My university ended up sending a formal apology letter about my thesis advisor. But in all honesty, none of that would have happened if I were able to take the leave of absence the first time it was mentioned. I just couldn’t afford it. 

And when I was forced to take the leave, it was extremely difficult to even focus on my mental health because my leave still became work. 

I dont know if this is the answer you are looking for but the hardest part may actually be funding.

The research market of industry labs for CS has been quite active. Notable labs are often from within big tech companies.

fnxy81r,zempathetics,t2_n9a1bg7,"hey there - as someone who held both a similar orientation as you (not intending on going into academia on starting my PhD) as well as a social science focus in an intervention oriented field (education, in my case), I can share some thoughts from the other side of the PhD having not pursued TT.

I'll note, since you're prior to the start of your doctorate, that my personal opinion is that given the current academic job market,  someone should only pursue a PhD if one of the following is true for them:

1. They are absolutely sure they want to become a tenure track professor.

and/or

2. They have a (very) serious itch when it comes to inquiry, learning, and research in the field they're pursuing their doctorate in.

The latter was true for me, and I don't regret it for a moment. I absolutely loved getting my PhD. Barring some bumps in the road that are pretty standard, it holds as one of the most profound and personally meaningful things I've done in my life. I only mention the above criteria because without at least one of them (and, if the first is true for someone the second should be too), it's unlikely someone will complete their PhD. To my knowledge, the stats are that about 50% of those that pursue doctorates actually complete them. You don't make it through to completion unless you're quite dedicated to the goal - it has way less to do with intelligence than perseverance, combined with a lot of supportive conditions (and that's saying nothing of the stats, which are far lower, of those who earn the doctorate and then go on to get TT jobs).

All that said, I have great news for you! You're planning on studying in a field that has lots of great options outside of academia, and you also seem to have an orientation and interests that would make you a good candidate for a pretty wide range of jobs.

You've got good options as applied researcher or evaluator in a range of public, non-profit, philanthropic, or private sector organizations that are connected to (or even less connected to) your field of study. These could include:

**Public (federal/state/municipal)**  \- These might be social service or education agencies at various levels, and the nature of the job would look different depending on what level you're operating in. Cons here are that the pay usually isn't very good, and there's often quite a bit of bureaucracy (at best) and organizational dysfunction (at worst, but this is everywhere really). Upsides tend to be the possible impact - applied researchers working in settings like these often do work that has scale and reach, and can inform policies/practices that affect many people. I know lots of folks that do great work and have satisfying 'alt-ac' jobs in these settings.

**Non-profit** \- these could be community based mental health or education organizations, national organizations focused on research and advocacy, etc. The dynamics can be somewhat similar to the above, though much more variability on each of the three dimensions I noted (pay/ bureaucracy/scale), as those usually tend to track with size. A big difference here as that there also tend to be more options in this space to remain connected to the academic community and do things like publishing/sharing research, depending on the situation. This is especially true in non-profits that have a very specialized content focus (e.g., early childhood development research) and also think tank jobs, where researching, writing on, and, to some degree, advocating around specific areas of policy is the bread and butter of the work (and yes, there are jobs in think tanks that are not 'political', at least in the narrow sense of the word, for folks specialized in various applied social science disciplines).

**Philanthropic** \- these jobs are somewhat more few and far between than either of the above, but they're out there, especially if you're connected to a subfield that's ""hot"" in the philanthropic community (early childhood is one in your general area, as is social and emotional learning). In my experience, research positions in foundations tend to do a mix of evaluation work and strategy work, depending on the size of the foundation and its orientation towards the research community more broadly. Definitely better pay, and variable on bureaucracy and impact, depending on how much money they give out.

**Industry** \- there are certainly jobs in industry for those involved in psychology, though I know much less about this space and where folks from psych go in terms of industry. My sense is that some of these tend to be more in the realm of either industrial/organizational psychology. There are also many people that are former academics and don't continue their disciplinary focus, but bring their methodological skills to that table. I have numerous former grad student friends who were in psych and education who went into the tech sector to work in data science positions, as UX/UI researchers (both qual and quant positions), or even just in general organizational strategy positions. Obviously better on pay, same in terms of variability on bureaucracy, and almost always less oriented towards pro-social impacts.

The one down side of all of these, in terms of what you shared, is that doing things like teaching and mentoring grad students is not part of the job. Teaching is always possible at local universities (though, \*very\* poorly paid, on a per course basis), and it's possible to maintain jobs in the areas I mentioned and also teach - employers often like it as it bolsters the credibility of their research staff. But mentoring students in the broader sense is out - that's reserved for those in the TT. It does happen in teaching individual courses - I've done so and really enjoyed helping students think about their research areas and dissertations - but not the same as the 'full' version that TT faculty get to engage in.

All's to say that there are plenty of options out there (and, by the numbers of jobs available, more than in the TT academic world, TBH), so you've got many pathways outside of the academy.

&gt;Another reason is if it could affect my professional development, but it could also help round out the set of skills that I'm lacking in.

PhDs do not grant you much of a skillset over a master's degree other than in original research. If you don't intend to work as a researcher, it is typically not worth pursuing a PhD over simply having work experience in whatever you actually want to work on. I don't know what skills you are lacking in but unless it is related to research of some sort, it's probably not what you'll get from a PhD project.

&gt;there are still some thoughts I have that feel discouraging. For example, how long it would take me to complete my research and if I'm only doing it because I want to attend certain schools for the experience and to say I received a PhD from there.

As stated above, a PhD is not worth doing unless you have a firm grasp of what you want to do with it. It's a big time investment - not to mention that just having some sort of empty bragging right for having one is not sufficient motivation to carry you through the program.

&gt;Lately, I have been feeling burnt out and I saw that is something that is a reason majority won't pursue or drop out/""master"" out. Although, that could be because of the pandemic going on and not being able to do daily activities I was once able to do and being stuck inside trying to fixate most of my time studying vocabulary words.

If you felt burned out during your education before then that may be a concern but it depends on the root causes. If you are feeling burned out only very recently NOW in the current ongoing pandemic, I would not take that as much of a hint of anything, except to take good care of your mental health in these challenging times. PhD students are not gods and we also get stressed and frustrated by the current situation. Don't be too harsh on yourself when it comes to the current crisis and take care of yourself.

Finally, my general advice to you is more to make sure you know what you want to do with whatever path you pursue and to read up on the type of education that people in the jobs you eventually want to get have gone through.

I did and still do conduct research in communities I am a member of (I'm a queer woman of color. I've studied in all three). Personal investment, contrary to what some may think, doesn't necessarily make you a worse researcher. It doesn't necessarily make you a *better* researcher, either - just a researcher with a different perspective and other strengths and weaknesses to bring to the work.

What can suck is the psychological toll, especially if you're doing research on the problems and challenges of your communities. I've conducted research on chronic illness, drug abuse, mental health, harassment and violence in disadvantaged populations. Sometimes, confronting how entrenched, systemic, and persistent your communities' problems are can get depressing on an existential level.

And it *absolutely does* change the way that you think and feel about your community. You'll have a deeper knowledge of the threats, challenges, opportunities and strengths in your community in a specific area than the vast majority of the world. Sometimes, that knowledge will absolutely frustrate you in a deep, deep way. (I have a PhD in a health sciences field. My mental health sucks right now.) Change isn't always a bad thing. My research has had me discover deeply entrenched inequalities, yes, but also incredible resilience and strength.

These have to be questions that are going to get you out of bed every day, occupy you in the shower, and drive you through the sometimes grueling process of research in academia.

Secondly, college is hard on many people.

If your personal life sucks, then it's even worse. I was very depressed in college and threw myself into my work. I needed serious mental health assistance by my 3rd year.

Grad school was a much better experience for me psychologically, but only because I got real help in college and learned how to deal with stress, accept failure, and balance my personal and professional lives. In grad school I was surrounded by people who didn't get that help and they were miserable. That will be you if you can't sort out your issues in advance of attending.

Also, you don't have to go to grad school: now, or ever. There is a whole world of jobs between a dead-end job and academia, it's just that you have never been out in the work world and looked for them. I hadn't either. But they're there, trust me.

foc6kyw,aomines,t2_gl429,"Hi - so it is actually very common for mental health professionals to encourage their patients to google/talk about their disorders and things like that. My therapist did it with me when she gave me the diagnosis and told me to tell her what I thought about it the following week. While I learned a lot from her I also learned much of what I know about bipolar from other people online who have it, as well as medical websites and such.

I think my point is that things like terminology and ""real mental disorders"" aren't only decided by researchers. The people who are experiencing the struggle themselves are going to know their mind and body the best, even if they don't know the nitty gritty details that come with vigorous research. Telling someone their disorder doesn't exist is incredibly invalidating and could possibly trigger their condition to be much worse - especially for people with mental disorders as self-validation is a skill many of these people lack. I know at my worst, if someone told me I was faking it, it would have felt like the end of the world and I might have had another suicide attempt.

For an anecdotal case, I was misdiagnosed several times before I finally received the diagnosis of bipolar. Even trained professionals who have been at it for decades don't always know best for a patient.

My other point would be, I don't think the specific label matters too much. DID is one illness out of many that can be treated in similar ways. There are some disorders that benefit more from certain treatments (BPD with DBT for example) but in general, therapy and medication are typically tailored to an individual's needs anyway and a large amount of mental health treatment is trial and error. Also, when things are comorbid, when you treat one illness sometimes the others are more manageable.

In short: mental health is very subjective, and I think trusting the experiences of people who have disorders is important. There is no reason for a perfectly healthy individual to fake having a bunch of comorbid illnesses so regardless of the specific label, it is clear they must be struggling in some way and go to therapy.

d0f716i,woxihuan,,"&gt; the things I'm interested in learning and understanding are graduate-level, maybe even PhD level stuff.

I'll help clear something up here, which is easy to not know: ""graduate"" is a terms that applies to MA and PhD levels. Both MA students and PhD students are graduate level. You're thinking in terms of a hierarchy of smarts, when really what it is is a narrowing of specialization(s) and switch from coursework (MA) to research (PhD).

Graduate level work is not necessarily about intelligence. It's true you need a basic level of intelligence, sort of - but it's *more* important that you're dedicated, hardworking, and increasingly refining your skills and area of interest, all while being self-motivated.

Graduate school coursework is advanced training in the theories of your discipline. It's also training to work in academia, which is kind of an intense as fuck process of enculturation. Also remember - academia today is more of a profession than it was before, and it's increasingly more a business. You'll need to work 40+ hours a week in graduate school to stay on top. It's not easy, because unlike a job, *you'll* be the one making yourself do those hours. You'll also be trained teaching, research, and service functions for the job, which may or may not be useful to you, but are essential for academics. Things like grant writing, committee meetings, planning sessions, that stuff.

Intelligence and curiosity aren't necessarily part of it. Focus and willingness to be devoted beyond the norm are more important. For you, if you're just interested in, say, Digital Humanities, then just look into industry-related jobs and see what you can do with a BA. 

As for your grades, those are too poor to get into a program right now, so you'll need to improve them to keep the option open in the future. I would suggest trying your best.

The biggest deterrent is your mental health. Take me: I am a perfectly mentally healthy person with great self-esteem, near-perfect marks, a solid teaching background, and good writing - and even *I* am feeling a litte like a failure in graduate school.

That's not enough for a second full time job. 

Second what if meetings concerning research overlap with internship hours? It's likely other students or the PI will check in with you periodically especially if WFH. Are you willing to risk internship thinking you're moonlighting? 

Which is my 3rd point. The internship is full time. They are expecting your full effort, not distracted by research obligations.That means you well rested too. You will want the networks formed by this. You want to have a good impression. 

If those 4 empty weeks are at the end of summer could you start the research then? Or see if there's anything brief you could do for 4 weeks before the internship, full stop, then pickup in the fall? Talk to the PI. 

Worst case of only doing one? You have some bored hours after work to pick up a hobby, read articles, see friends, cook, workout, craft, play video games etc. Worse case of you doing both? You lose friends as no time to see them. You get caught doing both and lose the internship and the opportunities from it. You mess up something due to being not 100% and lose some opportunities. 

It sounds like you are really set on doing 2 internships in one summer. I dont advise that. If you absolutely want it, I would talk to both bosses and get the okay. But I would expect them to have reservations similar to mine and potentially feel like you don't really want their opportunity. 

Oh amd to address b - really solid research experience can happen in a school year. Doing 3-4 months extra in summer won't make or break it. And devils advocate what if you rock the internship, discover you love it, and end up getting a job offer from that company? Keep your doors open.",1,2020-04-06 01:00:54,AskAcademia

cqyq4xa,phdme,t2_n9bgu,"If you decide you're really serious about it, you might consider what I did as a much cheaper alternative to getting an MA before the PhD. I had some major mental health challenges getting through undergrad and by the time I pushed through to finish it I was working full time and just took night classes from a diploma mill type school to get it over with. As I matured and recovered, my intellectual curiosity re-awoke and I realized that I wanted to pursue a PhD, in a humanities field that I had almost no credits in for undergrad since I got a generic business degree. 

So I decided to get another BA from a ""real"" state school (the first one was real, just not all that rigorous). The advantage of doing it this way is that you can get the degree in 2-4 semesters (probably 2-3 in your field, two regular and a summer), it's usually much cheaper than an MA, you have the chance to bring up your overall GPA (and many programs only look at your most recent 60 hours, which can be a huge boost if you do well), and it gives you the opportunity of developing new relationships for those all-important recommendation letters. If you do an MA and go on to a PhD at another school, you're likely to have to do all the classes over again anyway. 

Most importantly you can point to measurable accomplishments in your field in the form of classes taken, and hopefully end up with a kick-ass writing sample from one of those classes. (This last item is really key, a great statement of purpose and writing sample along with the commitment I showed by going back for the extra degree and research got me into a top ten PhD program despite my *very* checkered academic past). You also will have the chance to explore the field a little more than in an MA, since it sounds like you still need to figure out where your interests are.

The big disadvantage of doing it this way, as I have learned the hard way, is that an MA is likely to prepare you *much, much* better to enter the PhD program at a level equal to or ahead of your peers. On whole, the lower cost means that I probably still made the right decision for me personally, since my debt load is about half what it would have been, but I am constantly aware that most of my classmates came in much better prepared. 

Anyway, my point is not that you *should* do this, just to make you aware of what might be a lower-stakes option that has worked out for at least one person.",1,2015-05-05 03:09:24,AskAcademia

I think that it depends on if you think you (at this moment, without further studying) have a good handle on the material. If so, is there an alternative way to demonstrate your knowledge? For example, it helped me to have the option to take the exam earlier, in a quiet room, with the professor or someone else proctoring. I felt very relaxed; I could eat snacks, drink coffee, put my head down, etc. as long as the exam was done in the same time frame. Another option may be an oral exam by the same professor, which tends to be more probing than a written exam, may be more stressful, and something that the professor might not have time to do.

What is it exactly that your department wants? From what I understand, it would be best for the individual to maybe step out of their program because they are not fulfilling their academic requirements, but there is a concern that she has mental health stuff going on and you aren't sure how they might respond?
  
I would suggest connecting with a campus counsellor (not sure if you have counsellors that work on campus, a lot of Canadian universities do) and run some of the information by them and see what their advice is. They might end up recommending you have her drop in for an appointment so they can assess her and see what is going on, although, they won't be able to provide you with information (privacy and whatnot).
  
This gives you guys quite an advantage though. Once you have made that recommendation to her, you have washed away some of the liability, and could treat her marking as you would any other student. If you have made recommendations for that kind of support, it is their choice to actually seek it out. If they do have mental health concerns and want to use that as a way to defer exams or what not, they will have to go to the counsellor anyways to speak with them and get written support for deferring exams and what not.
  
Edit: As for communicating with the student, you can just be upfront about what is going on, but it also depends on how involved the person speaking with the student wants to be. My questions would be: how are they finding school? what has their experience like? what has been challenging? what are some alternative options (ie. do they maybe need time away from their classes)? what do they need to be successful/how can your department support that?

Fortunately for me, my school had free screenings for depression on national depression screening day. It was highly publicized with fliers all around campus, and that led me to therapy.

One of the conversations that frequently came up with my therapist was the correlation between academia and depression, and my fear about continuing my education at the risk of my health. The correlation is very real, and I'm pretty sure your school's mental health professionals are aware of it.

One thing I did notice was that as I gained control over my depression and started being happy again, my work ethic in academia diminished. And I find myself at constant crossroads as a PhD student: when my advisor wants me to spend more 10+ hours in the lab on certain days, we butt heads a bit. He says I'll take 10 years to finish my PhD at the rate I'm doing, and I tell him my mental stability matters more, and I can't handle that kind of stress.

A lot of faculty members I notice have this mentality that if their students don't dedicate their entire life to their projects, that they aren't committed enough and aren't worth time. I had to switch advisors twice because of this. At this point, I just want to finish my PhD (and maybe just leave with a master's) and teach immediately at either high school or community college. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I feel academia is a toxic environment and I want nothing more to do with it. I think the movie Whiplash is a great representation of what I've discussed.

ON the the other hand, learning can be marvelous and I believe it to be one of the only very few sources (  and i mean ""you can count them with one hand"" amount) for finding meaning in life as along with love 

Learning and personal development are one of the only things that give you that sense of progress, like if you unlocked a new ability in a game or a new tool. That in turn leads to wanting more, to see the ramifications of what you learned, and the causes of it.

Try thinking what you enjoy about it. This often (if not everytime) leads to some academic or artistic discipline.

If that alone does not make you feel like picking up that discipline, you could further think about how taking part in any community, say for example being a gamer, you can be someone that purely consumes games and adds nothing to the community, which although completely fine still puts you on the more passive side, and creating games and content related to them furthers cements your position in your community and might something that appeals to you.

Life moves on, everything heals, and what remains is a healthy dose of missing your loved one.  A healthy dose of grief. Focus on good memories, try to smile when you remember her, and keep in mind that she'd always want to see you happy and at peace.

I was 22 when I lost my dad, it was right at the beginning of my 4th semester of my BA.  All of a sudden, lung cancer.  This stuff works differently for everyone, but I found myself just going to school after the day of his burial.  Not really a conscious decision, more like my gut dictated me that I needed some fresh air, some ""moving things"" in my life. In retrospect, I did have episodes of grief and of just not knowing what I was doing, but I believe it also helped me not go down a spiral of bad mental health.

So if you listen to yourself and feel like your PhD might help you cope with things and you can focus on stuff in the coming weeks, maybe pushing on through could be beneficial to you. But if you feel that it'd be detrimental both to you and to your education/career, and/or you feel you need to stop and grieve her, to hell with everything else, take the opportunity to the deferment. In doing my MA I'm learning that people who didn't do these stuff are completely ignorant how much emotional labour and stress is involved in this thing, so I'd only take advice of my colleagues and supervisors.

This did not affect my chances of getting into a PhD scheme, the records besides my grades were not publicly available and nobody saw taking time off for family issues as a problem.

fn01vc3,palepinkpith,t2_13ark3,"I don't have much to add except that I see you and I am sorry this is happening. I am in a very similar situation and felt depressed to the same point as you earlier this year. Things got better for me after seeing a therapist and realizing the ways he pushed my buttons. 

I agree with the others that outing them on social media is a bad idea. Wait until he does not have power over you. He will only make your life worse. Don't let his words get into your head. You will be able to find a job you aren't wasting his money, you absolutely can talk to other people.

Remember that a PhD does not define you. We are taught to believe this in academia, our social lives, every waking hour are focused on this goal. But there are countless stories of people leaving academia and finding much much happier lives. Hierarchical institutions are inherently abusive, and I am always checking in on myself if this is something that is worth enduring. Can you see yourself without a PhD? Would you be a happier person?

Do you have any other professional mentors that you can confide in? Perhaps they will be able to offer advice specific to your situation.

If you are set on getting a PhD, is it possible to switch advisors? It sounds like you are nearing the end of your PhD and I understand that it will not be pleasant to effectively restart your PhD. But perhaps with the skills you've learned you can find a better advisor and do your phd very fast. PhDs in the EU are already much shorter than the US or canada. And finding an advisor that isnt' abusive will create a much more productive and enjoyable environment. It sounds like the M-C EU commission is privy to your situation, perhaps they can offer advice on the best way to transition to a new lab and maintain funding. 

The other option is to just suck it up and finish as fast as possible. But I would worry about your mental health with this option. If you finish, I am certain that you will be able to find a post-doc with the right person given your circumstances and you can certainly find a job without publications.",1,2020-04-10 15:51:58,AskAcademia
fmycohs,AimanaCorts,t2_2b5syy45,"Mental health issues is a huge problem in academia.  It's likely your prof has dealt with his own issues.  And having a diagnosis helps you prove that it's real.  Many people have trouble believing mental health issues real, not just in women (how many say depression is just being sad and if you think happy, you'll get better).  I'm sorry your parents don't support you in this.  Talking with your mentor isn't letting him down or wasting his time.  If he didn't think you weren't progressing or worth it, he would have asked you to leave.  Him asking you to continue working over the summer is great.  If it helps you out,I'd explore that option.  Plus getting a paper out helps him out as well as you. 

Grad school is tough and mentally draining, I won't lie.  Now I'm from STEM so I was able to lean on my lab mates to help me get manage some of my mental health.  Keeping a balance between research and the rest of life is important.  I did take meds for my issues.  Finding a group of other grad students for support can really help.  And grad school doesn't require as many classes at once so you have more time to focus on research or teaching.  

Also keep in mind that the current state of the world is going to make everything worse.  I know you are having trouble getting your meds right now. But think back to how you managed research and school.  That's closer to what grad school can be like that now.  That doesn't mean you shouldn't explore your career options outside academia.  But right now is hard on everyone.  Talk with your mentor if you feel comfortable.  I've written a list of topics to discuss when I'm nervous about a topic and afraid I'll chicken out.  Then it also shows my mentor I've thought about it.  And it's usually has a few things on it including research progress and personal stuff.  Do what you feel comfortable with.  But remember your mental health matters as well.  Keep pushing to get your meds.  Hopefully you'll be able to find a solution so you can be successful.",1,2020-04-10 01:45:01,AskAcademia
fmy1q8t,gkayaalp,t2_2j9mhu6x,"&gt; No, I haven't done anything directly targeted at the students who have checked out. My life is crazy enough between teaching, research and caring for a child who no longer has a school to go to, so I'm really not interested in convincing adults to take their education seriously.

I don't really want to sound harsh but if you're saying not much changed w.r.t. your approach to teaching after all this, and also the above, that's not good, you're probably part of the problem.

I've been doing MOOCs on my own time since 2012.  Since then I've self-taught myself programming, then did a BA in literature, then self-taught linguistics and started an MA in linguistics last September. In the last 8 years I probably watched hundreds of hours of online lessons on youtube, used many MOOCs and read a tonne of material, be it usual online resources or books. All in all, if I rinse and repeated that ten times, it would not equal a semesters worth of proper learning.  It wouldn't make half of a single seminar course. We lost all that, and almost all our social life, and many of us are struggling with many other problems be it social, health (loved ones falling ill or dying, also mental health), or economic (shitty students' work, and loans). On top of that the school has turned into a big factory of futile chores for many.  As an MA student all I'm doing is writing and mailing assignments.

I won't blame you or my instructors tho, this distance learning bullshit is a big worldwide mistake.",1,2020-04-09 23:51:15,AskAcademia

I’ve found it frustrating that the work I’ve been doing isn’t informed enough by historical precedent. Without being too specific, there have also been some recent developments in my field of work that I feel have historical resonance that has not been drawn out in the literature I’ve come across. 

From a more personal perspective, writing has always been my strong point. Providing care and support for people on the ground, as I’ve been doing for the last few years, has been rewarding, but has taken its toll on my physical and mental health. 

I’m aware that being back in the library after spending a few years “in the field” may bring back some of those “ivory tower”feelings I had as an MA student, but my hope is that bringing my work experience together with my academic background will give me a sense of fulfilment that neither one was able to by itself. In addition, I’ve had the opportunity to do some teaching and training over the years and it’s something I know I’m good at.

fokps1r,bettysbad,t2_5l5y36cj,"you may wanna join the darkside my friend and disrupt the psychological sciences. I'm much more into tangible action and community work related to social justice type stuff, so i got a masters of social work and got into writing critical literature outside of work, then when i was credentialed melded them together so i can put some of that phenomenological work into practice.

but the literature needs to be bulked up, there needs to be a deeper exploration of the brain, its emergent properties like culture and experience, and how it relates to the collective, to culture creation, how culture colors experiences. for example people who hear voices in the u. s. often hear more alarming or persecutory voices, some tie this to our culture having little formal space for voice hearers in society. in other cultures where voice hearing is accepted or admired, the voices are experienced as more helpful and more integrated into the self. 

psychology and the mental health industry (in the u. s.) is full of flawed post positivist research trying to prove to the health insurance companies psychic health is worthy of being reimbursed for. it leads to rigid schools of thought that dont account for socioeconomic context or cultural differences in experience. it leads to reinforcing the fucked up structures in the psychiatric industry that harm real people everyday. 

so. your work might actually be helpful in changing a portion of the Healthcare system. 

but you could also go in to medicine, public health, sociology. you could also go into a more anthro/tech direction and kinda work to develop the current next edge in thinking aboit reality and humanity. i think again, think strategically. you can become a cult academist with a ted talk and the book deal without getting a graduate credential. you could be extremely well read on the subject without a graduate credential. you probably cant carry out a large scale research project especially with govt funding without a credential or at least a close affiliation with someone who does. but things like participatory action research make things more accessible depending on what you're tryna do.

find journals and journal articles that get at what you want. dont just look in academic databases. there are collectives, zines, and artists who self publish critical work all over regarding similar things, and that work enters academia as well. follow the careers of folks of all ages you admire and the fields they contribute to. figure out your strength and pov. 

im someone with a lived experience of mental health issues, so my exploration tends to be psychic or psychological. what is your self interest or purpose in the work? that can give you a clue as to where to start.",1,2020-04-25 20:30:24,AskAcademia

Realistically, the transition to work from home has been rather difficult for me.

cfsoemn,[deleted],,"&gt;Aren't interviews one way to see what the applicant's mental health, personality, and interpersonal skills are like? 

That may be the intention, but research has shown graduate program interviews to be an unreliable predictor of said qualities. A big part of that is due to nerves; every applicant is aware of the fierce competition and the stakes, and so it can be very difficult to function normally during the interview.

&gt;I think there is merit to this claim, but, at the same time, I don't think that many graduate students are ready to do fully independent research.

Yes, and I wasn't talking about fully independent research. Not only is mentorship essential, but it simply wouldn't make sense to pair people with incompatible research interests. There needs to be some overlap. But the overemphasis on ""fit"" has led to a situation where graduate applicants need to tailor their supposed research interests specifically to those of the potential supervisor. This means that, rather than getting the freedom and support to develop themselves as original thinkers and pursue their individual interests, a lot of graduate students essentially function as slaves for their PIs and risk becoming clones.

frtcw24,corgibutt19,t2_fm8c3,"Hi!

This is slightly off topic from your question, but I wanted to share. I have general depression and anxiety. I luckily did not need to take time off in undergrad, but I coped poorly with alcohol and burnt out very hard by the end; my GPA and general participation in the lab I was in etc. suffered. I took time off after, though I admit it was something ""productive"" (thru hike of the Appalachian Trail) and was thus able to put it on my resume.

I'm doing a lot better, but I knew that a PhD would be a stressful event on my mental health. When interviewing and trying to pick a school, the environment and the resources available to students in terms of mental health were very important to me. I asked about work life balance, reactions to mental health issues, etc. during every interview. I cited the somewhat recent study about poor mental health in grad students and asked what the school was doing to address this and the answers were very enlightening (the school I'm at launched into details about their well functioning student health system, another said ""well, we once stopped a suicidal student after realizing she'd been missing for a few days"" (jfc)). I actively sought out a therapist within the first month of school. I also began taking medication for my anxiety, which was a very difficult decision for me and a harder one to make while I was doing 'okay' and not under a lot of stress yet. My point is: grad school kicks everyone's butt, if you know you've got some weaknesses, be pre emptive about them.",1,2020-05-25 23:02:21,AskAcademia

I did the same thing with my PI last week.

I told him if we set a deadline (end of the month) that I would have a great, non-typo'd version for him to completely edit. I won't go into details, but we argued via email all week (which stressed me out even more).

frruqyj,boilerlashes,t2_5x6hlwbw,"All of the things you listed are very common issues - doing a PhD is *hard*, you are spending 4-5 years of your life working on one very specific set of questions, if you're doing bench work lots of times experiments don't work, and it can be hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel until you're almost done. It can also be very isolating - you're in a lab with other people, but you're each working on your own thing, and you will end up feeling at some point like everyone's experiments are working except for yours. There is also a lot of rejection in academia that you just have to get used to - papers rejected, grant proposals rejected, conference abstracts rejected. It can be a very heavy mental load at times. Personally, I didn't have previous mental health issues when I started my PhD, but I ended up dealing with depression and anxiety in my 2nd/3rd years until experiments started working and I could see my way to the finish. 

All of that said... I made it through, just got tenure at a university I love, and don't regret any part of my PhD experience. It was very hard to be in it, but I made it through and doing a PhD was definitely the right decision for me. I think the more you can prepare yourself mentally for the experience, the better off you will be.

Good luck. None of these decisions are easy. I think it's also helpful to remember that these decisions aren't permanent: if you do start a PhD and decide 2-3 years in that it's not for you, you can always master out and get an industry job.

frrs7nl,__eudaimonia,t2_5s0jzr9s,"Hi there, first of all I just want to say well done on continuing your educational journey through bachelors and into postgrad! There are likely more people within academia with diagnosed mental health conditions than you may realise. I am doing my PhD in clinical psychology, so I recognise that perhaps the departments I’ve studied/worked in may be more accepting of disclosing one’s mental health status (although I would hope that the same would be true everywhere). I have friends and colleagues doing PhDs who have diagnoses, and so please don’t let that alone be a barrier to you accomplishing your dream. Regarding your first bullet point, it would be fine to explain the gaps as time you needed to take off for your mental health. I suspect that it would be considered discrimination to reject an applicant solely based on disclosure of a diagnosed condition. 

While this shouldn’t stop you, I’d advise you to really think about whether academia would be a good career path for you and for your mental health, particularly if those who know you well (and love and care about you) are advising you to reconsider. Postgraduate students are three times more likely to struggle with mental health issues; one in two PhD students will experience moderate to severe psychological distress during their degree and one in three will be at risk of having or developing a diagnosable mental health condition. 

I would suggest having a discussion about your future plans with your current academic supervisor (if you feel comfortable to do so). You say that they suggest you seek another career path; it is worth listening to why they think academia may not be the choice for you, and what advice they may have for you. The choice will still be yours, and it may be a difficult conversation to have, but I hope that it will help you with this decision. As you said, it may not be related to your mental health status at all, but having a more sensitive and anxious nature will inevitably make academia feel even more stressful than it already is. There is a lot of toxicity, rejection and competitiveness within academic culture, which may not be the type of environment that you would thrive in. I also want to highlight that it is entirely possible to continue within research without a PhD, particularly in industry/third sector organisations. If anything, having a PhD can be a disadvantage, as organisations can view you as overqualified, whereas a degree such as an MSc can be extremely beneficial. You might want to look into non-academic routes that still have a strong research focus, which may suit you better. 

I hope you don’t feel too discouraged by my reply. You have already demonstrated great resilience by finishing your BSc and working towards your MSc, so this is not to say that a PhD is not for you. It is, however, to encourage you to consider that you may be able to achieve a successful and (more) enjoyable career in research without a PhD and without continuing in academia. Either way, I wish you all the best!",1,2020-05-25 14:39:55,AskAcademia

frrqolz,boilerlashes,t2_5x6hlwbw,"Current PI and Director of Graduate Studies here. I'd suggest a couple things: first, sit down with your current supervisor and (if you feel comfortable doing this) ask some more specific questions about why they are suggesting you do not apply for a PhD. Is there something about your output or dedication to the work that is motivating them to say this? For example, in my group I feel the main difference between terminal MS vs PhD students is a type of intrinsic curiosity - is the student going above and beyond? Reading papers and formulating questions related to but outside the scope of their current project? This is the hallmark (in my mind) of a student who will be successful in a PhD program and academia in general. If your supervisor is dissuading you only because of your history with mental illness, then perhaps you can take their advice with a grain of salt. If there is something lacking in how you do your work, though, you should know that now - it could be a reason you decide not to go on in academia, or it could be something you dedicate yourself to addressing before you apply to PhD programs. Your supervisor has both a good perspective on your work and also knowledge of the field and how academia works in general, so try to get as much advice from them as possible. This will also potentially give you a preview of how they will write about you in a Letter of Rec, which is important for you to know now.

If you decide to apply for PhD programs, you can describe your longer than average undergraduate timeline as due to ""medical issues"", which is true, without needing to get more specific. I would hold off on describing your mental health issues in detail until you feel comfortable with and know the people you are disclosing this to. 

Finally, not to dissuade you but just to prepare you - PhD programs can be much more stressful than MSc programs. Be sure you have good support - therapist, psychiatrist, GP - in place before you start any program.",1,2020-05-25 14:24:22,AskAcademia

I have been all alone throughout isolation and the past one month has been the hardest. I haven’t been productive at all and have been avoiding emails or anything work related due to anxiety attack whenever I try to get on it. I even avoid my desk. I have finally decided to prioritise my mental health and will be flying soon home after 3 months in isolation. Like you, I’m beginning to question my real passion and career path. It’d be so much easier if my PhD isn’t funded, which makes me feel even more depressed. I’m planning to take a month leave to focus on feeling better and see if I’m able to bounce back.

I’m giving myself until the end of this week to see if I can produce a work that’s worth showing or else, I will email them next week to discuss my options. I’m scared but I will do it.

The statement that having a PhD isn’t a life and death situation resonates powerfully with me after experiencing this pandemic in total isolation. It was difficult for me to come to terms with that but this past few months has been been life-changing. I used to have a lot of “what ifs” in my mind especially regarding my funded programme, but I no longer feel as scared. 

Things will be of course be challenging if I decided not to pursue this further. Nobody said it’s gonna be easy but there’s always a rainbow after the storm. I just need to survive this storm to see my rainbow. Now that I’m starting to see some clarity, I will continue to pursue this path and pray that things will turn out for the better eventually.

However, living in isolation without any human or animal contact no matter how comfortable your living condition is tough. I’ve moved to a studio for a few months then bam! This pandemic happens.

I’ve been observing the lockdown rules religiously. I started stocking up before everyone started panic-buying as I’ve been following up the situation in my home country where the handling and adherence to the rules are better. I only go out for fresh food but seeing most people not wearing a mask, I feel even more paranoid. 

I was so paranoid that I didn’t even go out to exercise until a few days ago after getting advice from my loved ones and people on here. It felt nice, but I didn’t feel safe. Most people are really being so casual about this pandemic despite being one of the worst-hit countries with one of the most deaths. 

I would be tested as soon as soon as I reach the immigration point and sent to the quarantine centre. If, God forbid I contracted the virus, I’d be taken to the hospital immediately for treatments. I will not see my family until end of June or July depending on my test result, but knowing that I’d be in good hands puts my mind to ease.

I can’t wait to be home where things are under control now. The economy has reopened since a couple of weeks ago but people are still observing the rules. Shops that weren’t following the SOP were ordered to close. It’s nice to know that the country is up and running again without compromising people’s safety.

&gt;It is possible you could withdraw (saving some money) OR get extensions on your work if a 'mental health' issue is in play (which it sounds like it is).

I know. Those are the most logical steps and are the first thing my professors and other university staff always recommend.

Without exaggerating, I was working 12-16 hours a day, 7 days a week for those full two years. There are a couple reasons for this - (i) my research involves field/lab-based data collection from live animals, resulting in demanding hours, and (ii) I was in a new lab that was starting out and there was a lot of enthusiasm and energy that we all fed off of each other and really propelled us forward. 

Starting a PhD in a different lab in 2008 I kept that pace up until 2009, then suffered (perhaps a non-surprising) burnout.

fs8sg3n,synthesis-synthesis,t2_3ev125pt,"In your original post you explicitly stated that **she is not paying you**. This is partly why I emphasized ethics rather than metrics. Your ability to pay your bills and feed yourself isn't dependent on this article; I would assume it's not dependent on any single piece of work but, rather, a body of research. 

I want to emphasize again that an anonymous email will accomplish nothing. There's no universe in which a researcher allows some unidentified rando to dictate what is and isn't published. The editor will assume you are a troll or an unhinged colleague. If, for some bizarre reason, they bother to read your take-down closely, ***they'll realize it must be the mathematician listed as an author***. Who else would be as familiar with the ins and outs of the computed results?

And it was clear to me from your post that the primary issue is your relationship with this person. That's why I stressed the importance of therapy. You can't change her or how she speaks to and acts towards you. You can only change your own cognitive and behavioral patterns. Again, **a trained mental health professional has strategies they can teach you how to use in order to remove yourself from this person's orbit in a way that minimizes fallout.** 

In response to something you said in another reply: **you should not, under any circumstances, attempt to ""discuss"" her behavior with her.** She's already demonstrated numerous times that she doesn't respect you (or anyone). You ""asked"" her permission (why?) to cut back on your free labor for her, and she bit your head off. That's not going to change.

Other posters have commented that your replies consistently make excuses and resist the consensus about how to move forward. I think you sound anxious, afraid, and unable to imagine alternatives. (Therapy.) **I don't want to dismiss the power asymmetry here.** (More therapy.) However, a few things stand out to me: 

**1)** Just because she helped you early in your career doesn't mean you're obligated to let her treat you like shit nor does it mean you're obligated to make yourself complicit in bad research. Neither loyalty nor debt are at issue here.

**2)** Everything you're doing is driven by fear of confrontation, but you're letting her aggressive narcissism (and your social anxiety) create an inaccurate sense of how much power she exercises. You're not even in the same fields. If she rages, let her rage. (But again, if you want to avoid that as much as possible, get help from a therapist.) 

**3)** Focus on your relationship with your PI. Even though this person also seems somewhat spineless, presumably they are the one who decides whether to renew your contracts, assign you to other, actually relevant projects, etc. 

**4)** Lastly, you seem too obsessed with h factor. Like, clearly her reputation is shit because all these other people have abandoned her, and she can't get any one besides intimidated graduates to support her. *Just because people tolerate someone doesn't mean they respect them.*

My advice is to report him and to seek counseling. Are there counseling services offered at your university? I’d try to find a counselor that specializes in sexual assault/trauma. 

I’ll also offer a parallel from my own experience. When I was an undergrad, I joined a lab where I was sexually harassed by one of our technicians. Being new to the lab and feeling like I was an idiot for not seeing the signs/like I brought it on myself, I was terrified to report it to my supervisor. I thought that I’d lose my position and jeopardize my academic career because it could be construed as a “he said, she said” situation, and that my word would be trusted less because I was new and they didn’t know me as well as him. Eventually, sexual harassment progressed to sexual assault. I was traumatized, still shouldered the blame, was in heavy denial, and in that mindset, thinking that I’d be fired, never said anything for several years, despite working with him the entire time. I became self-destructive over that time because I wasn’t processing the trauma, and I see now that being in that state was more hazardous to my academic career from the impact on my mental health than what he had done. Everything built up and when I was in grad school in the same lab, the stress of graduate studies and all involved brought the whole trauma to the surface to the point where I had to deal with it. At the same time, this tech was starting to harass other women in our dept, one of whom was a close friend of mine who helped me move past denial to realize what happened. After cracking, I told my supervisor what had happened several years before - absolutely sure that it was the end of my graduate studies - and he never questioned my word despite that I didn’t have tangible proof. He fired that technician that same day.

I still regret that I never said anything sooner. If I had, that tech would not have been able to harass other women and put them in the same situation as myself. In hindsight, not processing what happened nearly derailed my academic career. It was severely impacting my studies and I was to the point where I was considering quitting graduate studies altogether.

I hope with all my heart that you recognize your strength and report him. The potential consequences of not reporting him are far worse. Try to talk with somebody you trust (prof, mentor, graduate coordinator/chair, counseling services or sexual assault services at your uni, etc.), as they will have guidance specific to your university and can support you as you find your way through this.

As a PhD student now, the RAs I mentor now will collect data for me. For example, I was interested in online mental health resources available for high school student athletes in my state. The RA went to the list of websites I provided and looked for the resources I asked them to find. In addition, I worked with them to develop their own research question that could be done at the same time. My RA chose to look for any information on vaping and included that in the data collection. I guided her through the analyses for the data and she is taking her project and will be the first author/ present it. She will also contribute to my project and be second author.

However, she also contributes greatly to literature searches, as do the other undergraduates in our lab. If a student is writing as much as you are- they’re first author. Hard stop. That’s the ethical thing to do. 

The misconduct would come in as well if I made my undergrad mentee write the bulk of a paper going towards my dissertation. My dissertation will involve some data collection at sporting events, and my RA mentees will be assisting in that. That’s completely ethical. But all analyses and write ups, such as the discussion, should be my own. 

Our RAs are compensated by research credit. 1 credit = 3 hrs of work a week. Most take 2 credits so they work 6 hours. We NEVER require them to work more than that unless they ask “hey I need next week off so can I work a little more this week and a little more in two weeks?”. There are also weeks where there might be a little more work to be done- for example all the undergraduates present the project they’ve been working on to the undergraduate research symposium. The week the abstracts are due and the week the posters have to be printed tend to be more hour heavy (despite constant reminders sometimes they like to procrastinate)- we take this into consideration and make sure they have leeway in later weeks. So it sounds like you might also be taken advantage of here too. You’re not getting compensated at all, plus it sounds like you put hours upon hours of work in. 

I’m sorry your research experience is going this way. I hope you at least learned something about the research process (it sounds like you did!) and will get to see your name published before you graduate.

I would do a lot of introspection on this: first, get as much information as you can -- without relying on your professor as the source of information -- about access to prescriptions and medical care. You can even consult your current doc and ask for their opinion, both on the access and on whether they recommend you travel for this long period. There should also be a travel office on campus that can give you some answers. second, really reflect on whether you feel like you're in a secure and stable place to make this move.",1,2020-05-07 13:16:45,AskAcademia

fpqzegb,onsereverra,t2_7z1oyh,"I can't imagine a whole lot of scenarios in which it would be necessary for you to disclose the specific disorder. Start with something like, ""I take a medication that I worry will be difficult for me to procure in \[destination country\]. Have you or anyone you've worked with had a similar situation when conducting research abroad?"" On the off chance he *does* need more information about the specifics for some reason, he can tell you as much.

I also highly doubt that your mentor is the *only* person who can help you with this. Your university's study abroad office, your psychiatrist, and even your country's embassy in the destination country are all likely to be helpful resources. You are certainly neither the first nor the last person to need to navigate issues of managing medications when going abroad for extended periods of time.

Also, I'm honestly sure there's out there on the internet that you just haven't found yet. Have you tried googling the names of your specific meds to find out whether they're restricted in your destination country (this will have a huge impact on how you need to proceed)? Are the meds a controlled substance in your home country (because if not, you can often get some sort of travel exemption to get several months' worth at once)? Have you tried googling how people of your citizenship generally get prescriptions for physical health issues filled in your destination country? Do they need to get re-diagnosed by a local doctor, or are evidence of their home prescriptions generally sufficient to get a new prescription issued locally? How do things like insurance and payment work? The answers to these questions are likely to be similar to those to your questions about prescriptions for mental health, but will be much more widely asked and answered online.

Now, all of that being said, from the perspective of a fellow MA student (so definitely take this with a grain of salt), I don't see any reason why you *couldn't* get specific with your mentor if you think the relationship you have with him would make it appropriate and comfortable for you to do so. I just think there are a lot more resources out there than you're thinking there are.

fpk0038,late4dinner,t2_771bx,"In academia, rejection is one of the most common of experiences. It never goes away because we keep being evaluated (e.g., for publications, conferences, grants, programs). It always hurts more early on in this career, but it's important to develop an effective coping mindset. In my experience, a good strategy is to try viewing rejection as taking stake with how an idea, application, or whatever is currently seen. Maybe this means you need to communicate something in a different way, maybe it means you need to work on an aspect of your CV, maybe it means nothing and was just luck. There are so many factors that go into successful/unsuccessful outcomes in this type of occupation that viewing those outcomes through a self-centered lens is really problematic for our mental health.

fr67jvq,banamana27,t2_8bekw,"I'm so sorry you're going through this. Though you're quarantining alone, you are definitely not alone in feeling this way or being in this situation

The other commenters have covered most of it, but I wanted to add a few things. 

1. Your mental health is your top and only priority right now. Set aside your Ph.D.  and any thoughts / concerns about it for now. It sounds like your advisor is really understanding, so they will support a mental health break. 
2. Please, please, please seek counseling. It will give you an outlet to talk about what you're feeling / experiencing that won't be 'burdening' someone else. That's their job. If you don't have access to remote counseling through your university or health provider, there are chat services and crisis numbers that you can use. Don't ever be afraid of calling a  crisis number just because it feels like you're not in crisis. You need someone to talk to, and that's their entire purpose. However, I do highly suggest you find someone who you can get to know and speak to on a consistent basis. It has been a saving grace for me during this time.
3. Go outside. Even if its just on your front porch for 5 minutes. Work your way up to taking a walk around the block. Wear a mask if you're worried about it, but they are finding the rate of transmission outdoors is very low (see the [UC Davis website](https://health.ucdavis.edu/health-news/newsroom/tips-for-enjoying-the-great-outdoors-safely-during-covid-19/2020/04) for more info). Sunshine and a little bit of exercise (even just a short walk) are incredibly important when it comes to mental health.
4. Once you find a more stable mental state, ease your way back in to working. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but the best way to defeat anxiety is to face the situations that make you anxious. Anxiety is a self-reinforcing system. When you avoid something you are afraid of, your anxiety takes that as a sign that you were right to be afraid of it. The more you avoid it, the scarier it becomes. The best way to break out of that cycle is to do small things to ease your fears. Someone else mentioned just sitting at your desk. That's a great way to start. Maybe do something fun (painting, eating lunch, knitting, etc) while sitting there so you associate good things with your desk.",1,2020-05-19 20:48:06,AskAcademia

Research experience: I've been on one team for 2 years and joined an additional one last year. The most recent team I am on is funded by the NIH and can be also counted as a NIH research internship. (2 years of research experience on 2 teams); presented 2 posters at an APA affiliated conference and at a school conference. \*\* the research is about mental health and developmental psych

Internship: worked at a refugee services center and helped develop a mentorship program.

Things that I hope to accomplish before I graduate (and can add on my resume):

possible publication, possible internship at a rape crisis center, mental health technician (for domestic violence), joining Psi Chi

Goodness, my interest in this seems to be so tangled up in my whole life history. I guess within the past 3yrs, the thing that really caused this interest to bloom was my own mental health. Had a really really bad season that completely pulled the rug out from under me. I've always had an existential bend in my thinking so I was compelled by the relief I felt when consuming art and getting lost in those stories. That slowly led me to reflect on how my entire life is a story I constructed and how I participate in a storied world, full of things we have all chosen to view as ""reality."" But I know that line of thinking pre-dates my difficult season, because that line of thinking was exactly what caused me to pursue the field of anthropology as an undergrad.

Please include any educational, familial, cultural, economical, or social experiences, challenges, community service, outreach activities or opportunity relevant to your academic journey;how your life experience contribute to the social, intellectual, or cultural diversity within your chosen field; and/or how you might serve educationally underrepresented segments of society with your degree.""

My argument is consistent with the prompt: the admissions people clearly think that non-academic experiences contribute to success in physics (note: I do not say that those experience make them ""good at doing any physics"").

""Please include any educational, familial, cultural, economical, or social experiences, challenges, community service, outreach activities or opportunity relevant to your academic journey""

Everyone loves to read about the latest cancer research, mental illness research, breakthroughs in our fight against alzheimer's.  But no one really can actually differentiate a real study from a fake one.  

Prime example, Reddit front page.  You have submissions titled, ""Mice Autists found to carry bacteria that can solve world hunger.""  And everyone will lose their minds b/c getting rid of world hunger is awesome.  None of them care that the sample size was 12, it was a convenience sample, and the study only tested the association one way.  You could see how HuffPost could drive A LOT of views to their website if one of their health journalists picked up a crock study from Belgium that claims to have found a link between cuffing your selvedge jeans and cancer (even more so than a cure b/c everyone loves to hear about ""danger"" - negativity bias and so on).  

So, my study, revolves around the 1998/2004/2010 Wakefield-autism-mmr-vaccine controversy and how journalists handled the debate, that was by no means contentious, and how they decided to portray that struggle.  

You have a lot of health blogs and huffpost leading on the public and its understanding of vaccines/autism by not definitively declaring outright that 12/13 original investigators of the study withdrew their sponsorship (2004) or that the Lancet (the journal that initially published the study) partially retracted the study in 2004 and then fully retracted it (after ministry of health or whatever found evidence of fraud) in 2010.  

Then why do so many wealthy, well-educated families on private insurance opt to exempt their children from vaccinations?  

My dataset is pulled from the top 10 newspaper dailies in America, from 02/02/2010 - 02/02/2011 (the lancet pulled the study in 2 feb 2010) and is going to try and codify and analyze what journalists were saying about autism and mmr vaccine the year after the study was retracted.  How much of it was sound medical reporting and how much of it was sensationalist/preying-on-rich-mothers'-fears?

fr5o9dj,jamieejamss,t2_n7gtu,"Hi so there have been a lot of really good comments here and I just wanted to add my two cents as a baby academic with mental health and productivity issues!! It’s almost impossible for me to do a lot of the suggestions that other people have done when I’m struggling with executive dysfunction, but what I’ve learned is that watching people be productive and find reward in their hard work gets me so inspired!

I was really struggling to write my senior thesis a couple weeks ago and had no idea how to get myself in the mindset to go near it. I was the same way - too anxious to look at emails, too anxious to do anything academic but just kind of sit and wallow in my anxiety. Then I watched the Netflix documentary about women and women of color running for office in the US (I think it’s something like Tear Down the House?) and specifically seeing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez put in so much hard work, research, and dedication to winning her congressional seat inspired me so much that the next day I started doing work. A month later and I finished my thesis and am now working on more research and not feeling as stuck as I was.

Long story short, I think seeking counseling or some form of therapeutic support is crucial in trying to work through frustratingly ableist expectations of what productivity looks like and what is needed for PhD programs like yours, but I also know that sometimes the only thing you can do is sit and watch stuff or just kind of exist. I’ve put together some videos that help inspire me when I need to get out of a particularly rough episode, so let me know if you’d like me to send you some links that have helped me! If you also need an accountability buddy this summer I’m gonna be working on research for several months so feel free to DM me if you want somebody to check in with you, no judgement attached!

fr5fayt,CaptainChemistry,t2_cb7gd,"I think anyone who has done a Ph.D. has felt some version of this at some point, so you are not alone. It's hard, but we're here for you. Most of my comment will be centered around advice that might help. A lot of good advice has already been shared, but I thought I'd add my two cents. 

1. Atmosphere can help
2. Planning can help
3. No tasks is too small
4. Explore your options

1.  Atmosphere

When I was writing my dissertation, I did most of it from home, which was hard after being in the office for so long with other people. I would even go to the coffee shop just to be around other people. I like my alone time, but sometimes it's nice to be social, even when not directly interacting. Anyway, one of the things that helps me is watching TV that I have seen (many times) in the background of tasks that are not brain-intensive.  This was KEY for me making figures because otherwise, your mind can get away from you. One of my friends and I listen to epic movie soundtracks when we need to get things done. They're just inspiring sometimes. If there is something similar to this that works for you, give it a try. 

&amp;#x200B;

2 and 3. Planning and Details

I used to plan a lot of things in my day in chunks that I now see as too large (e.g. ""write chapter 3"" or ""do XYZ experiment from start to finish""). One thing that has helped me is to break things down into very small, digestible parts, just like individual steps in a protocol or recipe. For writing, I find outlines for each paragraph helpful. Keep going with details until eventually, you have a sentence. Then you can start stringing those together later when you feel good about it.   

4. Options

At times like this, mental health can be hard to take care of. A friend of mine shared this video which I found oddly inspiring/comforting ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snAhsXyO3Ck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snAhsXyO3Ck)). It asks us to improve, which is hard, but it identified boundaries that we might need to carry through this pandemic into our lives after this. I have also found that regular counseling is really important to my continued well-being. I know that this can be expensive, but depending on circumstances with your country, university, family, or personal finances and health coverage, you might be able to benefit. I recently moved from North America to Europe and looked into different options. I have recently been continuing to zoom call with my counselor from my Ph.D. days, but I looked into alternatives when I first arrived. I found that [https://www.betterhelp.com/faq](https://www.betterhelp.com/) (FAQ listed here) offered a range of options, including unlimited messaging and schedules that work for you. The ability to communicate ""constantly"" through chat or to schedule phone/video calls might provide the outlet that works for you. I encourage you (and others) to look into all the options available for working on mental health. It's extremely important and often overlooked in our ""produce epic results all the time/right now"" kind of world. We need our downtime and to recharge, and we need to be allowed/encouraged to take care of ourselves and to have others help us when necessary. 

&amp;#x200B;

I encourage you to stick it out a little longer and to try  some of the things posted in this thread. See if something can work for you.

If you broke your leg and weren't able to get care for it, would you try walking on it every day? It sorta seems like that's what you're trying to do.

Is there a process to take time off from your university for health reasons? Where I am, I could take a month of personal leave or a semester/year of medical leave. Your sponsor likely has no idea what they are inflicting on you. Ask and maybe you will receive.

My heart goes out to you, by the way. I have anxiety and medical-related PTSD and this has been a tough time for me. I spent a couple weeks essentially reading romance novels and doing no work before I got my medication, my meditation, my exercise, and my sleep in order. Or closer to being in order. I also started bullet journaling, which is apparently not about being artsy but is in fact a structured way to approach your goals. I am five years into a phd and was feeling very hopeless because I am so often unproductive for mental or physical health reasons, but bullet journaling has made me feel empowered again.

You want to write, but are stressed out and trying to force yourself to write just stresses you out more.  Repeat this a few times and you now trained yourself to become stressed when you write or think about academics.  So many people fall victim to this cycle but grad school culture does not talk about it at all.  Breaking the cycle is not a one size fits all thing, but step one is to try to notice that you are getting stressed out based on habit at this point.
 
For your own mental health I do suggest talking with someone as they can help you with strategies that work to break the cycle.  There is a sky high suicide rate in academia from students who get into this place that we also do not talk about.

Given what you describe--anxiety, burnout, and disruption in eating and sleeping--it sounds like this has had an effect on your mental health. I want to encourage you to get the support you need during this difficult time. If you are still eligible for your university's counseling services, that is one option. If not, consider counseling in the community. If there are faculty or mentors you trust, you might consider checking in with them and letting them know how you're doing.

It sounds like you have already made the decision to drop your senior project. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're close (perhaps just the senior project?) from finishing your degree? And you're looking at what to do from here. We can't make the decision for you, but I can see breaking this down into three options:

1. Stay with the same advisor, and repeat / finish the senior project during the fall semester. If you do this, I strongly encourage you to open up a dialogue about how you're feeling about everything. Ask your professor what you need to do in order to successfully pass your project. This past semester, there is a chance that, for all of your advisor's criticisms, you would have still passed. Of course, it's hard to know, and it makes sense that his communication style would be intimidating. Let him know what you need in terms of clear communication about your progress.

2. If your program allows, you could consider completing your senior project with another faculty member, ideally one whom you trust to be supportive and treat you respectfully.

3. You could leave the program. It would be a shame to do so when so close to graduating. But if staying in this program is bad for your mental health, then it's an option on the table. I encourage you to not make the decision to leave rashly. Instead, explore options to successfully completing your degree.

(e.g., if you land that TT position, the next 6 years will be devoted to tenure, by which at the end of you'll be \~40, then you'll be swamped with committee work, grad student work, etc and half your life will have passed). Many academics never learn to live life outside of work, and they end up clinging on to academia with no life outside of it. I was on that route since I prioritized my work so much in grad school, but it wasn't a healthy way to be.

I also do think it's possible to have success in a postdoc without sacrificing your romantic relationships, etc. I still work hard, I just try to work efficiently rather than long hours.  Another postdoc in my lab and I came in at about the same time. She's my housemate, so I can see how much she works-- and it's pretty much all the time. She does not have friends here, doesn't go out ever, etc. She seems unhappy and struggles with mental health. 

She is about one paper ahead of me. But, I still have 2 papers in the chute after working here about a year. At this rate, in 3 years she'll have \~9 postdoc papers and I'll have \~6. Certainly a difference, and it might be one that lands her to a TT position while I don't get one. But there's so many other factors at play, and my postdoc advisor seems happy with me, so I try not to make comparisons.

Also, I never falsely ascribed you any positions as far as I can tell.  My stance is that prospective hires should not be screened because of the role of screening as a discriminatory practice.  I don't really know why you're describing me as 'nasty""; I went back over my posts and it doesn't seem like I was trying to attack you.

I'm simply trying to answer your question: 

&gt; Should prospective hires be screened for grandiose narcissism, given that this personality disorder is allegedly disproportionately represented among faculty and that Millennials allegedly score higher on average on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory? 

Screening may be unlawful under Title I of the ADA

&gt;Title I requires employers with 15 or more employees to provide qualified individuals with disabilities an equal opportunity to benefit from the full range of employment-related opportunities available to others. For example, it prohibits discrimination in recruitment, hiring, promotions, training, pay, social activities, and other privileges of employment**. It restricts questions that can be asked about an applicant's disability before a job offer is made**, **and it requires that employers make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities, unless it results in undue hardship.** Religious entities with 15 or more employees are covered under title I. ( [https://www.ada.gov/cguide.htm#anchor62335](https://www.ada.gov/cguide.htm#anchor62335) )

This site also offers some clarification:

&gt; [https://www.jgllaw.com/blog/can-employers-conduct-mental-health-screenings#:\~:text=Because%20serious%20mental%20illness%20is,phase%20of%20the%20hiring%20process.](https://www.jgllaw.com/blog/can-employers-conduct-mental-health-screenings#:~:text=Because%20serious%20mental%20illness%20is,phase%20of%20the%20hiring%20process.)   
&gt;  
&gt; In regard to potential hires, the ADA prevents employers from asking questions about disability status during a pre-employment interview. **Because serious mental illness is considered a protected disability under the ADA, employers should not conduct any type of screening for mental illness during the interview phase of the hiring process**. 

Since your initial questions involves the screening of prospective hires, then it seems that institutions should not be legally allowed to do that as it is illegal to questions a person's disability status during pre-employment.

It would seem it is also illegal to attempt to identify any possible mental health issues in the pre-employment process.

Also, I'm not sure if NPD is necessarily categorized as a disability, but it apparently has a high rate of comorbidity with other mental disorders ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic\_personality\_disorder#Comorbidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder#Comorbidity) ). 

I think maybe rephrasing the question would help.  You point out in another comment that you wanted to 'spark a spirited discussion' but the question is declarative and seeks a declarative answer: ""Should prospective hires be screened...""  I say no, because it is possible it is illegal under the ADA and personally I think it seems rather arbitrary.

Your position seems to be that the screening should occur given some of your comments on other posts.  

I think a better way of asking this is ""Would screening faculty and students for Narcissistic Personality Disorder be ethical?"" or ""What are the ethical implications of screening faculty and students of an academic institution for personality disorders?"" or ""What would the be the costs versus the benefits of screening personnel? or something in that vein.",1,2020-07-24 12:56:57,AskAcademia

d60z6vk,cnm03d,t2_sd2jz,"Having been in a similar situation, however it appears not as aggressive as yours, I can only really give my perspective on how I handled my situation. Funny thing though, mine just didn't tell me I needed therapy, they actually called the Dean of Students telling them that I needed a mental health intervention. Fast forward some time, I left, and my PI ended up losing their job.

I left my program and found a new advisor in a different state who like you mentioned, told me I wasn't a terrible scientist and that I had good skills and experience to provide. Having been now 5-6 years away from this situation I can reflect back on how I handled the entire thing and what I wish I would have done, and what i've learned from it.

The very first thing is that if a grad student is having some issues with their advisor their first step should always be the graduate coordinator (it's probably written in your graduate manual to do this). Similarly, I let things get way out of hand before I went to mine, but that person is the faculty member in your department that is there for you and will help get to the bottom of the problem. Have you gone to your graduate coordinator or department head to discuss your difficulties with your PI? Have you told them that you're withdrawing? One should really work within the confines of the system if you are having a disagreement with a coworker (or boss). One of the big things I learned with dealing with conflict is to be hierarchical in my complaints and to be as fair as possible to my supervisor/coworker, even if they don't deserve it. This is about saving my reputation as a professional employee. If you report this to someone high up in the university without allowing your department to handle this, you'll be pissing off everyone. I always now tell the person that I have a problem with that there is a problem and this is how i'd like to see it corrected. If it's not corrected than we will have to bring in a third party. This makes it so there is no surprise to anyone and I don't have to answer to anyone of ""why didn't you let them know you had an issue?"" 

It's probably at this stage not worth discussing with your PI that you have problems, when I brought it up with mine it was way to late and that's when they called the Dean of Students on me. You probably should go straight to your graduate coordinator. If you are getting text messages that are threatening and abusive from your PI then you should go and show your grad coordinator and/or department head those texts. Most departments want you to have an exit interview before you actually leave, whether it's graduation or when you withdraw. They want to reflect upon your experiences. You need to be prepared that you may need to talk about this with them, and you should, and they are not going to be able to do anything when you are walking out the door. If your PI is truly being abusive and pretty much harassing you, your department will support you if you give them the chance.

Leaving is fantastic. Things will get better and you will be a better academic because of this. But tread lightly if you're going to complain and if you're going to complain, give the department head and graduate coordinator a chance to intervene before you go above their heads. I get it, I get why you wouldn't want to because it appears that all the faculty are friends, but there's a boundary of professional conduct that they will not allow to be crossed (and they might not be as good friends as they look). I really, really urge you to go them first and bring proof- again, the texts are perfect because that crosses a big line.

Good luck and I saw you responded to someone else about not having letters from your PI. My first one was terrible and we have no relationship so I have no letter from them. My second PI was amazing and wonderful but he passed away. I have no reference letters from a formal supervisor. People are understanding that situations happen. While I will never have an amazing reference from a graduate advisor, I do have decent references from people who know me professionally. Along with my CV.

&gt; I don't know what more can possibly be done here

I think finding some way to make this easier or to remove the barriers to it might be very helpful, although I'm also not sure of any great ideas.

At my uni there are a bunch of different support systems -- counselling, disability support, learning/education support (eg getting back on track after failing or being caught plagiarizing etc), plus systems you can work through if you've failed courses but have extenuating circumstances etc.

I think one of the biggest problems with having so many systems is that it's hard to know what to do, and hard to get started.

If you're struggling in your degree, you've failed a bunch of things, and you're still in the thick of whatever problems have caused that in the first place (mental/physical health, family problems, legal, financial, etc) you don't really have the ability to take a step back and go through all the often-stressful steps to try to withdraw from courses without penalty or appeal a suspension.

So, finding some way of making the paths to actually getting help with things easier, or some sort of triage where you go ""here's my situation, how do I fix it?"".

I will summarize a timeline of events in order to provide more content to the situation that I am in.

prior to 2009: Noticed minor issues with energy, regardless of the amount of sleep I got the night before, as well as poor time management issues. Chucked it up to needing to organize my life better and made attempts to do so. 

2009 to 2011 - Program A at University 1: Sleep issues and daytime fatigue began to become a concern. Sought medical advice and was determined that I was experiencing a slight iron deficiency. Iron supplements were suggested as a form of treatment and complied with doctor's instructions. Daytime fatigue and inconsistent energy remained an issue.

2011 to 2013 - Program B at University 2: Sleep issues, daytime fatigue and poor concentration became increasingly difficult to manage. Further medical advice was obtained; blood tests, sleep analysis and psychiatrist evaluation were performed. Blood tests shown no issues, sleep analysis shown a minor deviated septum, otherwise normal. Psychiatrist concluded with a general anxiety diagnosis, no treatment suggested and was recommended to visit campus mental health services for further help. Assuming good health for the most part, I concluded that I was simply not interested in the program I was studying in. Voluntary withdrew from university to explore other educational interests.

2013 to 2014 - Community College: Initially performed well due to lighter course load and most content was background knowledge for me. Performance began to decline after the first semester where sleep issues and poor concentration relapsed at a greater intensity. Medical advice was sought once again. Blood test came out normal and another psychiatrist evaluation was performed where I was diagnosed with depression. Made a hasty decision to go back to University 2 thinking that treatment for depression would fix things.

2014 to 2015 - Program B at University 2: Returned hoping that treatment was successful. Continued to experience the same symptoms and academic performance suffered. Was removed from University 2 during the summer of 2015. I decided to search for a new doctor to get a second opinion. Second opinion was determined and treatment was provided. Treatment was determined a success where my overall performance and ability in life matches that of the average adult as opposed to one of a sloth.

Essentially a series of incorrect diagnoses and uncertainty with regards to my medical health has robbed me of my prime years. I am not bitter and have learned a lot from this. All I want now is the chance to go back and continue what I started, but I feel that no matter what I do to inform my university of this, I will never get the chance to see this happen.",1,2016-06-22 19:44:42,AskAcademia

g18z999,synthesis-synthesis,t2_3ev125pt,"In my experience, you can't avoid the administrative flood. All you can do is manage it so that you only do these tasks during certain windows of time. This may not sound like enough, since you're asking about how to avoid this unfortunate reality, but it makes a massive difference. 

One small example (with huge ramifications) is writing on my syllabi that I **don't respond to emails after 6pm or on weekends**. (Ideally, I also don't check my email either, but this can vary. Regardless, no replies.)

I also **don't check work email before noon** on most days. I don't think a truly life-ending emergency has ever been communicated via email, and I'm also not responsible for my colleagues'/students' physical/mental health, so I feel great about this choice. It means my mornings (unless I'm teaching) are purely for myself and my research. It also means that no matter what happens in the afternoon, I've accomplished what I need to take care of myself (a nice breakfast or a gym workout) and to move forward in my career. For some people, the hours may be different, but the principle is the same.

You train others how to treat you and what to expect from you. If you're sending out/responding to departmental or student emails at all hours, then they will think of you as a 24-hour ATM. That isn't sustainable. And as much pleasure as we might get from research or teaching, all of that evaporates when there are no limits around when we're working and not working.

I think this matters because the school and hospital really pride themselves on being a leader when it comes to things like this.  

We’re currently in Phase I of our return to research, which means a limited number of people can be in the lab at a time but must wear masks and be 6’ apart at all times, and we are told to telework for anything that doesn’t have to be done on site.  They have cancelled in-person classes for the fall and asked students not to come to campus, and this was actually a change from a hybrid model that was made this week in response to locally increased cases and a huge jump in prevalence in young people.  It’s nice to see that the people in charge are really considering the data when they’re making these calls. We have a specific COVID hotline to call if we feel like we might be ill so that we can quickly get tested through our affiliated hospital.  

There have been many Zoom meetings and virtual town halls about everything COVID related, ranging from the science and epidemiology of the disease, to how we can improve testing and outcomes in local high risk populations, to practical matters about how we’re handling COVID and whether people are following current guidelines. I regularly get anonymous survey links to share how well people in my building are following all the COVID policies.  We’ve also gotten regular emails about mental health issues, including a comprehensive list of the resources available.  When everyone was truly locked down in the spring, we had a ton of opportunities for wellness (workouts, yoga classes, guided meditations) and cultural events via Zoom, although that’s lessened during the summer.

g0jtppt,MWL1190,t2_3z2jhvwp,"First off, I’m sorry that your research experiences haven’t been good ones and that you’re really feeling the strain. Know that you’re not alone on either count. If you haven’t already, I’d recommend looking at what mental health support resources your school has. I’ve been in therapy on and off for a decade including all through my PhD and it was a lifesaver.

The question of where you want to end up is really pertinent here. If you want to end up teaching at a 4-year institution in any capacity, you’ll almost certainly need a PhD. That said, even in a field like CS where external funding is relatively plentiful, faculty positions are very difficult to get at the best of times and likely much more difficult for the next decade as higher ed realigns and adjusts to the post-COVID world. Those faculty positions which do and will continue to exist are almost certainly going to emphasize research, at least at the point of hire. Plus, 4-year schools that hire tenure track faculty with a higher teaching commitment, like liberal arts colleges, are likely to take a bigger hit from the current economic and public health crises and be in a worse position to hire new faculty in the coming years. As already pointed out, you’re likely looking at contract positions (lecturer, adjunct) which will pay significantly less and range from 1 to 3 years in length, with or without the possibility of renewal. Also, in an economic downturn, contract faculty are liable to be let go as a cost cutting measure with more of their burden getting shifted to tenure/track faculty. 

So, it sounds like you’re aiming for less choice positions since you’re not really as interested in research jobs. In a lot of fields this wouldn’t necessarily be a problem since these might be jobs that fall off the radar of those who really want the more choice positions. However, in higher education, the cycle is a killer here. Tenure track and prestigious contract jobs/fellowships get advertised in the fall. This is also where you’ll find those longer term lecturer positions (ex. 3 year renewable “semi-permanent”) but even though these may be teaching focused, the coin of the realm is research and if a school can get somebody who’s a very good teacher and a very good researcher they may take them over someone who’s an excellent teacher and a middling researcher. Teaching focused contract positions (think shorter term lecturers and adjuncts) typically get advertised later in the spring when programs know where their teaching gaps will be for the next year (ex. Who’s on sabbatical.) This application pool gets flooded with applicants who didn’t get tenure track jobs in the fall cycle, so you’re going up against a pool that’s just as big and qualified. 

Making a living on short contract positions in higher ed (your 1 year lectureships, 2 year VAPs, adjuncting gigs) can be difficult, bordering on impossible in some cases. It’s not even a matter of the low pay (which can be very low) but also of the insecurity of knowing that you need to apply for jobs year after year because you’re only on a 1 year contract. There’s also the matter of maybe having to move every year or two or three because your contract in one place ended and you got another 1-year job 2 or 3 states away. This may sound hyperbolic, but I assure you it’s not. I have friends who have been taking 1 or 2 year contract teaching positions for almost a decade and are emotionally and mentally cored out from having to uproot themselves (and in some cases their families) regularly and move somewhere new while knowing they likely can’t get too comfortable there because they’ll probably be gone in another year. This is aside from having to learn new systems and departmental politics. 

Before the economic downturn, I would have recommended that folks who are interested in teaching should look at liberal arts colleges. That market is now both saturated and taking a financial beating, probably to the point where many schools will close or at least will take several years to get their hiring going. Even if they’re “back to normal” in 7-9 years when you finish a PhD (if you plow straight through) you’re going to have to worry about the backlog of all of the folks who graduated between now and then and who are still on the market hunting. 

This has all been a very long-winded way of saying “be very careful and systematic if you want to teach without doing research at a 4-year institution.” If you do want to teach, your best bet is going to be hitting that research hard, despite these early frustrating experiences. Another option might be to look at 2-year institutions. Find a CS instructor at a local community college and see what their life is like and what the credentials are. Because of pay scales, CCs have tended to favor instructors with a Master’s vs. those with a PhD, but that depends talk to people on the ground and see what they have to say.

g0j88b8,Licanius,t2_3rzyj7,"Yeah, this is a tough one. There are positions that are permanent that are teaching only in university departments, especially departments that are research intensive, because they need to cover teaching releases for professors who get big grants to focus on research. This means that well-payed teaching-only positions do exist, but I've only ever met a few people with these positions. What's way more common is the lecturer position, which don't pay well, as you've mentioned, and also have next to no job security. This is enough downside for no academic in their right mind to feel comfortable recommending that career path to an undergraduate.

As for research... research is hard. Even when you have a good supervisor, things can be really frustrating. There's a reason why so many graduate students have mental health issues. But research can also be so interesting and rewarding that people decide that the tough bits are worth it. As you have specific courses on conducting research coming up, I'd wait and see if you find it more enjoyable. 

I guess I would recommend that you wait and see how the next year goes, and if you're still interested in teaching at the university level, to try a master's out.  If after a master's, you realize it isn't for you, at least you'll have a master's in a CS area and probably be pretty hireable if you play your cards right in other ways during your degree. If you decide you don't like research, maybe a position at a college is more likely to not be research-heavy?

I used to be like this and I'm glad I am not anymore.  The big realisation for me was that acedemia/other academics are totally indifferent to whether I chose to stay in the field or not.  To them I was just another Phd churning out mediocre research. Basically I was over-invested in something that took from me far more than it gave back.  Take a step back and re-asses what is valuable in life: time relaxing, good mental health, quality relationships with friends and family etc.  

Also it isn't one or the other: it isn't maths vs owning a home or having a dog and children. Plenty of mathematicians have those things and plenty of non-mathematicians don't. There is a whole world of lifestyle choices outside of the binary view you seem to have.

One program I am apply to (my second choice) looks only at the last 60 hours (I believe) of your undergrad. In this case my GPA will be higher. I have had a professor suggest that mentioning cultural differences in a personal statement could benefit. In my case I am bilingual and these cultural differences have personally played a role in my family, aside from what lead to my mental health struggles. These varying experiences from my heritage have indeed helped solidify my interests in memory and cognition.

g4xr7ma,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"First of all, it's so great that you are aware of potential concerns with mental health in your Ph.D. program, because there is so much you can do proactively to both protect your mental health and increase your feeling of well-being. My suggestions to you:

* During this transition period to your Ph.D. program, focus on becoming adjusted to your new program, people, and surroundings. Yes, there will be plenty of work and there can be some learning curves. At the same time, this is an opportunity to establish friendships among your new peers and get to know your new city, if you're moving. Some of that is harder in the pandemic, making it more important for you to be intentional in your efforts to reach out and build connections. Ultimately, having these connections is both good in its own right, and builds a network of social support for when you experience challenges during your program down the line.

* Know what makes you tick. Maybe it's exercise and fresh air, maybe it's cooking special meals, maybe it's artwork or another hobby. Whatever it is that makes you tick, make sure you make room for it still. It can be easy for a Ph.D. program to feel all encompassing, but these are years of your life, too, and it is important to make room for your full self.

* Know when you've done enough and that pushing harder will not help. There is always more that you can be doing, and finding the line to stop at can be difficult in my experience. But sometimes, staying up later to crank out some more work leads to sleep deprivation, which leads to feeling tired and having difficulty focusing the next day. Have priorities (e.g., what must be done now, what can wait) and find a balance between getting your hands involved in the kinds of experiences you want and that will help you to develop your career, while also being open to saying ""no"" when you have enough on your plate.

* Seek out therapy. Notably, you don't have to wait until you're experiencing a mental health crisis to go to therapy. The transition to your program--which, while a good thing, of course--is inherently stressful, and that is reason enough. You can work with your therapist to have a place to process what happens in your grad program and build skills that help you to cope with the ups and downs of your program.

Congratulations on beginning your new program, and good luck!",1,2020-09-12 15:25:15,AskAcademia
g4xnchg,Chiquye,t2_awsc1,"Remember it is a marathon. Try to find and make good friends in your program but, maybe more importantly, outside of it. I am in my 4th year and I can tell you that Qual exams are probably the hardest I have been pushed in my academic career. Enjoy coursework and try to make it work toward other long term goals (sections of your dissertation, maybe use it for publications) if that is how it works in your field. 

I would set up a system to take notes and streamline how you study and set up. I am in the humanities so I use things like Zotero, note apps (Evernote), resource organizer (Devonthink. I bought it with my first paycheck), and a word processor (Scrivener). Having a structure that you adhere to is better than racing to finish things constantly. 

Take mental health days. Everyone acts as though you need to work at least 8 hours everyday. Don't do this. I couldn't because I have a family but I watched cohort mates burn out in 8 months doing this. Most switched to 5 days at 8-10 hours or 6 days at 6-9 hours.

duigzh5,sixtyorange,t2_bb80n,"&gt; so what does it say about me if I can’t

Not much. There are some people who cope with this situation by being ['umbly grateful](https://www.metafilter.com/116042/Perhaps-that-should-read-enter-the-ranks-of-the-unemployed#4350625) for the opportunity to live a more-ascetic-than-thou lifestyle, and a few people who are genuinely happy on very little, but most people would never choose to live under that kind of financial stress if they had other options. And as you've seen, a lot of people have help. Even the people who don't have visible help from spouses may be getting help in the forms of loans, credit cards, wealthy parents, savings from working a different job, family that owns property, rent-controlled sublets, etc. Other people who work for really low wages in the city are also often crammed into illegal and unsafe under-the-table housing situations and even middle-class people have megacommutes from places like (in SF) Vallejo, Modesto, etc.

To talk about SF because that's what I know, UCSF is aware that the housing crisis is affecting PhD recruitment, and I've seen a bunch of posters up around campus aimed at students experiencing food insecurity. I know more than one person who lives in a van. There's next to no campus/subsidized housing available, and new students have a *maximum* of two years in housing. I'm not surprised that there's not much empathy from faculty since in my experience even younger faculty often have no idea about the scale of the changes of the last several years and the particularly gross aspects of America's most expensive cities. But the situation really does seem to be *uniquely* terrible on the West Coast. (I lived in NYC briefly on postdoc wages before moving out here, with a long expensive NJ Transit commute on top of my rent, and I'm *still* under more financial stress as a postdoc in SF.)

Okay, trying to be helpful now. What kind of outside work are you doing? Make sure that this work is actually worth it once you factor in commuting, prep time, and the hourly rate. In my experience doing things like editing or TAing additional classes are not particularly good deals. Also wouldn't recommend e.g. driving for a TNC. However, particularly if you have any name-brand schools on your CV (sad but true -- but use your current affiliation if you don't), with a degree in STEM, you can charge $65-80/hour to teach things like high school math, biology, chemistry, test prep, etc. as a private tutor. You have to hang out your own shingle or use something like WyzAnt to get these rates as opposed to doing it through Kaplan. Just keep in mind that your real ""hours worked"" are going to be around double because of lesson prep. My biggest piece of advice here is not to be humble about your asking price. Tutoring is a weird quasi-Veblen good.

Treating your mental and physical health will pay dividends in terms of helping you get through the next few years. You mention a psychiatrist which is good. Is therapy part of your treatment? I've had the most long-term success with a mixture of methods that included mindfulness meditation and skills (something like ACT) in addition to finding the right psychiatric med for me. Also, you'll feel better about life if you don't borrow from your own health. I was recently out for a week with a nasty virus and the next Monday I felt weirdly great about work -- because I had actually slept enough for the first time in ages! Physical exercise is another thing that seems like a net negative but actually brings a lot of benefits into your life; yoga in particular is a good way to get moving that (at its best) has a focus on exercise as something you are doing as a kind of self-care instead of yet another obligation/thing you must be good at, and there may be discounted classes you can take. I know it sounds counterintuitive to add yet more non-work stuff to your life when you feel overwhelmed already, but when your life is 100% about work and work is not loving you back, adding really fulfilling activities to your life (that aren't just about self-sacrifice but are about doing intentionally doing things you actually enjoy) can make it feel much richer.

Edited to add: I also don't know how you feel about ditching the car but if you can get even $1-2K for it, that could be a very useful starter for an emergency fund. I know Seattle is more car-centric than SF, unfortunately, but my impression is that transit is getting a little better up there and may even actually be better than here. You have to run the numbers, but I use transit, bike, and TNCs to get around here and it works pretty okay, and my expenses would go up significantly if I needed to pay for gas, insurance, etc. I take groceries home via Lyft and have a car share membership if I need to borrow a pickup truck to get a piece of furniture or whatever. It kind of sucks because there isn't a great route I can take on our (unreliable, crappy) transit to work, but it's at least less attention-demanding than driving, and you can listen to a podcast or practice meditation or whatever. And if you bike that counts as exercise! 

Also: shop around for credit cards *now*, before you need them. Credit unions, in particular, tend to be a great source of no-monthly-fee credit cards with very low APRs. If you really do have an emergency and have to use credit, the difference between a 15% and a 5% APR is major.",1,2018-02-19 22:27:48,AskAcademia

Maybe get a private therapist if you can afford it. Talk to your parents and friends about how some people have mental health challenges during a PhD and ask them to keep track of you.

Start therapy now so you're already seeing someone you like when your first Very Stressful Event happens. It will happen.

Make friends with other grad students. These are your people now. They're your battle buddies. They get what you're going through and commiseration will help tremendously. 

Build into your schedule dedicated off-screen time. No screens at all. It's best if this is what you do right before bed (better for healthy sleep).

I got better, through treatment and time, and I did finish successfully and now work outside of academia as an industry research manager.

I'll contend, given my experience, that we cannot accurately determine whether we should stay or go when we're not mentally healthy.

**// end of tldr**

I'm graduating from a computer science program this June.  Afterwards, I'm taking 16 months off to do some independent research and studying before applying to grad school. 

I'm thinking of completing a post baccalaureate diploma (in cognitive science) in this time (which would require me taking 6-8 courses, spread over two semesters).  The cognitive science department at my school is relatively small and somewhat tight-knit.  I don't think any of the professors would have a problem with me sitting in their lectures (even when i'm no longer a registered student at the school).

Specifically, my area of interest is in AI and machine learning, and the post bacc would be in cognitive science. The research groups I'm interested in working with during grad school are heavily intertwined between the AI/ML/Cognitive Science fields.


From my point of view, I could get the educational benefits for free by just sitting in on the lectures, but at the cost of having nothing to show for it on my CV.  **My question is, from a graduate admissions point of view, how much influence (if any) would having a post bacc be?**

I have a strong GPA and and some research experience from my honours year.  And I hope to polish up my honours thesis and expand on it in the coming months/year and get some publications too.  But the research groups I'm interested in are located at ""top"" schools with competitive grad programs.

The main crux of the dilemma is the money aspect as well as the stress aspect that comes with school, as another reason for taking a year off is for my mental health.

I think a lot of what you mention is a common enough experience that it is difficult to say whether any of your situation is extraordinary or not (e.g., you describe imposter syndrome perfectly, yet not everyone is cut out to be a PI, difficult to say without knowing you). The big exception here is your advisor. It is one thing to not get along great with your advisor, it is another thing entirely to be completely dismissed by them when you come to them with these very important concerns that deserve multiple serious conversations. If I were in your position, I would reach out to someone else like a department chair, someone in the administration involved with student retention, or another professor. Universities generally do not like to let go of PhD students, so you have some leverage. Perhaps they can put you at part-time or give you a semester leave of absence to work on your mental health. They can also help in switching advisors- you will want others on your team so that it is understood that you tried to communicate with your advisor and it was not successful (stay professional - do not bash your advisor and only talk about objective facts). Every program is different, but I’ve known people who switched advisors/had advisors leave and they did not add on significant time to their PhD. At least have some conversations about your options.

I know some people who left programs due to bad advisors or having children and they are happy with their decision, but it of course is not a fond memory for them.

I did occasionally miss it (got intellectually bored from time to time), but I \*never\* regretted the decision nor did I think I \*failed\* b/c I wasn't smart enough.

Point of the story is not to confirm that you'll regret it -- only you can know that -- but the bigger issue is that whatever you do, you have to do this the right way.

1. I think you should give serious consideration to what u/ethanfinni said about switching advisors rather than leaving the program. It makes sense that you're having difficulties working with a toxic advisor, and hopefully a switch would help out.

2. Based on what you said, I'm wondering about how you're doing in terms of mental health. Things like loss of interest, exhaustion, and guilt can be symptoms of depression. Of course, it doesn't necessarily mean you're depressed (many grad students feel exhausted, for example), but I thought I would bring it up. In particular, the weight of depression may make it hard to feel motivated (and may interact with having a toxic advisor--what they say may make you feel down and it's even harder to feel motivated). Really, regardless, I think it is worth seeking out support if you have not already done so, because simply working in a toxic lab plus making some big life decisions about your next plans is a lot under any circumstances. I encourage you to go to the student counseling center and discuss some of your concerns with friends, family, or mentors whom you trust.

3. If you ultimately decide to leave your Ph.D. program and master out, I would keep the initial communications brief and, at least initially, non-committal. ""After serious thought, I am considering leaving the program at the end of this year. I wanted to see what options may be available for earning a master's degree instead of completing the Ph.D., should I choose to go that route."" If they ask why, you can share about your issues in the lab, or you can just say it's for ""personal reasons"" or even for ""health reasons"" (as in, your environment is not good for your health).

g5c64wr,Kireina_Michan,t2_3a602vqk,"It will depend pretty much on the Professor / Lab Head of the lab you are applying, really.

The best thing you can do, of course, is pitch your CV and your motivation letter to the lab you are going to send them to. Make an study of the lab (I am assuming you are applying to a lab / research institution), and evaluate your CV and experience in those terms, so you highlight the aspects you´ve learnt, or the subjects you´ve taken, that most closely relate to the project.

Have an idea of the research they are doing, and try to think about yourself in that context. Mention the things they are doing you feel most motivated about, and the aspects you´d like to work on the most. 

I also recommend you to reach other team members and ask them how is it the work there, the environment, etc. Sometimes, there are places / labs that look awesome from the outside, and when you look inside... they are a nightmare. 

The times I got students (I am a postdoctoral researcher in a Neuroscience lab), the things I appreciated the most on them where: motivation, curiosity, interest and illusion for the work and the project. I think those should be qualities that most of the labs would like to see in their PhD Students... sometimes, more than their marks in the degree (but when you are applying to a position linked to the application of a fellowship... in that case, of course, being above the cut is essential!!)

But, just for your own mental health, I recommend you to make yourself a psychoanalysis, and consider what type of environment you would like to work in, what type of people you would like in your team. There are many many many many different types of labs, and if you get into one that just doesn´t align with your way of being, and your way of working, you will have a hard time. It´s better to wait, being selective, and just join a type of lab that truly aligns with yourself, and where you really feel comfortable. Doing science in an environment that doesn´t work for you, could set a premature end to your career (it has happened to me... but in my postdoc :\_(  and I know it wouldn´t have happened if I had had these aspects in mind)

fsykrxi,GugaAcevedo,t2_41u15are,"Hi! Sorry for my long answer!  
You are asking if they are ***seen***  as lesser in the US, not if they effectively are. In my personal opinion, and based on the experiences of several friends and people I know, the answer **is yes.** I am doing my PhD in Europe, and even my supervisor thinks that the US PhD's are better, so from the ***perception*** side, it may be true.  Do I believe it? Of course not.

So let's analyze it, so you can have an answer for people who tell you this:

Time:  As you said, while in the US you can go directly from BSc to PhD, in Europe you usually can't.  In fact, you need a 1 or 2 year MSc diploma before applying to the PhD, which means that your total graduate studies can take between 4.5 to 6 years, which is similar to the US. So, regarding the duration, the person who told you that, is wrong (but we already know that).

Quality: Regarding the quality of the program, I think that in any place of the world it will depend on the university, your talent and dedication, and your supervisor. If you check the QS rankings, you will se that in Top 26 (there's a tie in #25), 13 are in the US, and 13 are outside of the US, if you make that Top 50, then the ratio is 19:31 (19 in the US). This says 2 things: the first one, is that the US does have a very good tertiary education system when we talk about elite institutions; the second one, is that there are many elite universities outside of the US. The UK (where you are) has 9 universities in the Top 50 of the world, so if you analyze it in a per-capita basis, it seems to have the best university system in the world. In fact, if you are studying in one of the universities of the Russell group, your degree is among the best you can get in the world in your field. 

Publications: This is where it gets tricky. In Europe, specially in continental Europe, the focus on publications is less than in the US. While in the US people focus on having journal papers, in Europe many universities see the dissertation as the main focus. Again, this will depend on your supervisors, but I do know people who have finished a PhD in Europe with just 1 conference paper. This only means that the requirements for graduation in some doctoral schools may be lower than in the US; nevertheless, I have seen people graduating with 4-5 peer reviewed journal articles in the same doctoral school. So, it's up to you.

Working hours: I think this is a key part. In Europe most of the times you are an employee of the university, and as such you're expected to work 40 hours per week. I have worked with people who spent some time of their PhD's in the US, and their working hours increase on average 15 hours. This of course means that a PhD student in the US can make 25%-35% more research than her/his European counterpart. The cost? Usually mental health. 

The US ""We are the center of the world"" mentality: Ask anyone outside academia, and even in academia, about ETH, EPFL, TUM, LMU, UCL, Sorbonne, and most of them will not have a clue about those universities, even though all of them are Top 50 in the world. Being the largest economy in the world and the most powerful country, may lead some of its people to neglect the rest of the world, and be ignorant about it. You will find a lot of people like this, for example the prof you told us about. 

As you can see, the quality should be approximately the same. The time to graduate is similar, there are top institutions in the UK, you can publish as much as you manage, and work as long as you want. What you cannot do, is beat the ignorance that US academia has about the academia in the rest of the world. Therefore, if you want to be a professor in the US, it would be easier to think about doing your PhD in a university in the US; or in  university in the UK that is very well known in the US (Oxford, Cambridge, UCL, LSE).  If not, you can take the harder path, and explain to ignorant people, why a UK PhD can be as valuable, or more, than a US PhD.",1,2020-06-05 10:44:48,AskAcademia

It's probably harder to get into an nth-tier PhD program than it is to get an nth-tier programming (/etc) job. I know people who've dropped out of math and science PhDs and ended up doing very well in tech. 

Lack of motivation could very well be coming from the unique structure of a PhD (Personally, I hate the fact that I don't have any short-term deadlines and one big terrifying project I'm supposed to be working on all the time without a whole lot of guidance; I've thought about dropping out but I'm almost done...).

Yep. I acknowledge that in the 4 sentences that compose the post. I'm looking to identify and reduce my assumptions with additional data.

&gt; Define ""successful"" as it relates here. Are you referring to finishing a degree program? Getting funding? Getting a position in academia?

I've worked in start-ups with professors as C-level members. Most of them sucked but were successful in academia. For instance, one CTO created a major research center at a state university (not Ivy league by any stretch but still impressive). That CTO had severe issues with narcissism.

Another start-up CEO I worked with had autism but was a physics genius.

Another CEO I worked with was a self taught genius who made his money playing the stock market and used those funds to create an interesting start-up. This guy was the most neuro-typical.

All of these fit under the computer science and electrical engineering fields.

&gt; I work 50-70 hours a week, I cook and eat healthily, and I exercise. I don't avoid other people, although being in a new city and not knowing anyone makes meeting people harder.

I never said people like you don't exist. I'm looking for how common your situation is. In my experience, there are more neurotic people sac'ing their health for immediate returns than those dedicated to long term development. More importantly, I see people screwing over their health and GETTING AHEAD in tech. That's why I wanted to know how common/important this is.

&gt; What people are disputing is your totally baseless assertion that these things are an actual factor in success.

Why attack the question instead of saying just that? ""I see no correlation between poor mental health and academic success."" **That's what I wanted to see honestly. A lot of people saying, ""I've not experienced that.""**

My advice for a potential linguist specifically (I'm planning to submit my phd in sociophonetics in the next few months), is to spend as much time as possible upskilling for industry while you're there. The more programming/statistics/data science you learn, the more employable you're going to be both inside academia and outside it. My heart's in academia but I don't thin my mental health can deal with it long term (even assuming academia wants me in the first place, which is never a guarantee). But ling degrees, especially if you lean hard on the STEM aspects, give you a unique skillset that make you desirable in a lot of other areas.

I, like you, was also obsessed with the idea of becoming a professor, living the life of the mind and being paid to think about the world's unanswered questions. And, like everything in life, it was not what I had expected. I do enjoy the flexibility, the fact that nobody is really checking on me on a daily basis but there is way more admin to sort out than I would like - I just never thought about what went behind the scenes I guess. I always thought, as a student, that teachers/profs would just get paid to speak to an audience and that was it. The amount of paperwork I have to produce is at times rather insane. Then, on top of this, there are all sorts of other good/bad dynamics that you will have to learn to deal with: student mental health, relationship with colleagues, department politics. It is really a multitasking career and you have to be ready to use your brain in various ways, which is not necessarily a bad thing.

1.  That academic jobs are jobs. We're doing what we love, yes. But that doesn't mean we don't need or deserve reasonable hours and pay. And that it's okay to leave a career path if a better opportunity comes along. That goes for everyone: undergrads through senior faculty.
2. The idea that not everyone is going to be a faculty member at an R1 University or at all.
3. The expression of vulnerability and the seeking of mental health care

Don't reduce workload beyond that without recommendation from the professional.

I am in a place with a large number of international students and postdocs (and a few professors) to whom such help is not (cannot be) available, so more of handling each others from such aspects is on ourselves (and almost everyone has some struggles at least sometimes). So unlike most others here I will try to say how you may be able to help yourself - every student regardless of the student's mental (un)health, but may be especially important for students with such difficulties.

Every student is different, so you'll do the best if you ask the student themselves how you can make it easier and better for them. (Of course, only follow reasonable suggestions which don't take too much of your time and energy.) If the student doesn't give useful suggestions, you can also ask other lab members who may know the student better.

But generally... From this question and comments, you care about the student as a person, not only results-producing machine - that's great, and make sure the student knows that (but be careful to not show it in a way which can in the student's culture be interpreted as sexual/romantic interest). And that the student knows that you consider them very talented - and exactly why. Assign the student a reasonable load of concrete tasks which are useful for not-distant, easily foreseeable future (but not overwhelming), so that the student feels useful and valuable - that may include what you mentioned (""mundane tasks, reviewing literature, attending seminars""). Give suggestions how to start (or how to proceed when stuck), break tasks into smaller if needed (but not so much that it becomes micromanagement burdensome to you and/or to the student). Explain to the student why this topic is interesting and useful to others, why ""the work is important to the department and the lab itself"", and why it will be important for the student's desired career too. Give exact and reasonable deadlines when possible. Give deserved praise. Give honest feedback in nice, respectful way. Do reprimand the student when needed, but do it without others around and in calm voice, with clear reasons and suggestions for improvement, making it clear it's criticism of that behavior and not of them as a whole student/person.

Most importantly, if it doesn't help, don't blame yourself. You can't save everyone. There's lots of reasons beyond your control. When my nice advisor worries about me too much or/and blames himself for my poor progress/motivation, that just makes me feel worse.

flacetj,stop-animation,t2_5wcpt8f0,"Bit late to this thread, and I can't really be bothered crawling through all the hundreds of comments to see if anyone else has said this, but here is my reasoning for why I left academia the instant I completed my PhD.

The work is very stressful, very difficult, largely unrewarding, you work very long hours and for all your efforts you get paid a pittance. Consequently, I found very little pleasure in it. This sort of working life often causes PhD students to have litany of mental health problems (e.g. stress and depression), even physical health problems as you can begin to neglect yourself or consume unhealthy things to cope (e.g. junk food, booze/other drugs) and it is a pretty dirty fact of PhD life that you are basically expected to just ""deal with it"". Officially I think your supervisors/department should/would help you if you asked for it, but they're not likely to volunteer it and when they do ""help"" it's not in a very enthusiastic way. They just expect you to work work work.

On top of that, the environment was so unenjoyable and I couldn't muster any enthusiasm to be in the office. I won't pretend my environment was like some of terrible places the top comments have described - in fact, on reflection I think my department was positively glowing with decency - but I just found it incredibly boring. The academics I knew were all very mild-mannered, but it was impossible to have a conversation with them if it wasn't about their research area. Given the already isolating nature of doing a PhD project, to not even be able to have a lighthearted chat with your colleagues made it even more isolating and miserable. It was a suffocating experience that began to drive me mad, a bit like being confined to a totally white room, or eating nothing but bread and water. I just needed some *spice* in my life whcih I simply wasn't getting in the academic world.

Beyond my immediate environment (i.e. my office and my colleagues) academia is fiercely competitive. Although there certainly is some spirit of cooperation - such as collaborations between academics from different universities - I discovered research publications done shortly after my own that bore uncanny resemblances to my research... but I hadn't been referenced. It was sufficiently different to say it wasn't directly plagiarised, but I find it hard to believe that they hadn't read my work and been inspired by it. Frankly, I think they were just trying to spearhead the research area and get the glory and to reference my work - that came before theirs - would be to acknowledge that I got there first! Or perhaps I'm just being paranoid. Who knows. Other times, when submitting my papers for publication, the reviewers could be unreasonably harsh. One particular reviewer I remember was very disapproving that I use a particular technique, despite it being the standard technique in the literature, and none of my colleagues or supervisors - most of whom had exceptional experience - understood his objections. We quietly agreed that he simply had some unknown bias against the research. Predictably, despite our rebuttal stating that the technique was perfectly conventional, he did not change his mind. Slaving away for months to write a paper only for some asshat to reject it for some bizarre reason stung quite a lot.

To summarize, there are a lot of reasons that add up to academia being extremely difficult and unless you are perfectly suited to be an academic then it's a profoundly unenjoyable world. I realised how miserable it was after about my first year into my PhD and resolved to depart from the world of academia the instant I graduated. And I did.

All of that having been said, there was undeniably a deep satisfaction, albeit fleeting, for producing research - to publish a paper and add to the corpus of human knowledge - so I haven't ruled out the possibility of returning to academia some day... just not today.

Everyone has bad weeks. Everyone screws up. In those cases, I find the best approach is to be straight up and honest about the fact, but also remember to paint yourself in the best light possible. Emphasize where you've been putting your efforts, even if you didn't accomplish anything significant. Especially in this situation and at this early stage, your supervisor probably cares a lot more about your effort than your results.

cpv0fta,reverie17,,"It's interesting to me that people are so upset about the idea that someone who routinely goes to the professor for help, demonstrates the effort they are making in office hours, and shows a marked improvement over the course of the semester might get cut a break when the professor is giving the final grade. This is pretty commonplace, and I think it makes perfect sense - it's a way of rewarding someone for working hard and learning the material by the end of the course even though they struggled with it at the beginning.

Some of the students are saying it's not fair because you could do the same thing - study hard and learn the material you initially struggled with - without going to see the professor. While that's true, you can't be rewarded for effort that is not visible. The professor has no way of knowing that you went to a study group if you never talk to the professor. If it matters to you that you be cut a break, you have to make your studying work visible by actually going to the professor to discuss the material and the assignments.

The students are also saying that this penalizes students with anxiety disorders who are too afraid to talk to the professor, but to me that is an example of untreated or ineffectively treated mental illness interfering with your schoolwork, not something that is the professor's fault. Absolutely I think professors should work with students who have mental illnesses  and work with the disability office to provide the appropriate accommodations to that student, but if you can't even bring yourself to tell your professor that you have an issue, the professor can't help you. And at some level, there are always going to be certain things that are necessary to academic success - such as participating in class discussions, giving presentations, giving speeches, participating in debates or simulations, etc. - that are going to be tougher for students with social anxiety. The solution to that is going to be context-dependent, and sometimes there will be alternate assignments that can be worked out in collaboration with the disability office, but at least some of the time the answer might be that you have to complete the assignment or drop the class until you are at the level of health necessary to meet the requirements.

As someone explained, these grants and conferences are there to redress the balance and make academia a welcoming space for women, that it was not before, and to compensate for the huge weight of invisible discrimination such as their mental health, home life, subtle policing of body and clothes, creepy PIs at conferences etc etc etc. In this group in this moment are not getting as many opportunities, but once you apply for other jobs or collaborate in other teams you probably won't even notice that it will be tipped the other way and the established sexist culture will rank you over more qualified women, you will speak more in meetings, you will be respected and accepted more easily.

 So you just need to be as good as you can now, work hard and be successful without pulling others down or saying anything stupid (as you have wisely realised speaking up in your group would be) and later you will be just fine.",1,2020-06-27 14:52:17,AskAcademia

d8i43lv,drarch,t2_rd1ha,"If you were my student, the first thing I'd care about is your personal well being. Opening up about mental health is tricky, but I'd understand and likely respect you more if I could communicate with you about what's going on. Professors are familiar with students falling short of expectations, for a variety of reasons: lose interest, too much stress, give up, chronic excuses, etc. It can be natural for them to assume that you are a typical student in that regard, unless you communicate otherwise. 

Like another suggestion here, I'd reach out to your counseling services to get guidance on how best to approach it - you may be surprised that they have resources you weren't expecting. Their job is to support you, and going to them first may protect you no matter how it goes down with your professor. As the professor, if you were confiding in me your mental illness - and only as much as you're willing to share - then I believe FERPA / HIPAA would mandate that I couldn't share that information, as that is your private health information: http://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/hipaaferpajointguide.pdf

fukin31,ayayay_sassypants,t2_4e582e7s,"You are asking good questions. I wish I had all of the answers for you, but  I can tell you I relate with the relative isolation and limited network compared to other doctoral students. Part of why I can't help too much to answer your questions is that I was so oblivious to race as a factor in my own life for a long time--sounds weird, right? For that reason I can offer myself as an ongoing resource, but can't at this point really pin-point very many ways my race has interfered. 

One example I realized recently is that I often had to seek mentorship from senior folks/ faculty. Very few assumed in undergrad (small university) that I would be looking to a PhD and research-oriented long term, but at that time I already had my sights set. Looking back and knowing what I know now about teaching and mentorship and my own performance relative to my peers, it is surprising so few people asked about future plans and that so many people were surprised or felt the need to comment on how well I did. Still, few thought support me towards aspirations, guide me, or give me an encouraging nudge. I am especially thankful for one teacher in particular for doing this; she was a person I asked for letter of rec.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Anyway, I am determined to not let it stop me, but given how unjustifiably uncomfortable people get around me... a part of me feels afraid, and dare I say a sort of resentment towards myself for making this more difficult than it needs to be.

You've got the right idea and awareness going in, which I think can make a huge difference. If you don't mind, I'll share what I would go back and tell myself if I could go back in time: 

* trust your gut for not only following what others think are good opportunities, as your inexperience is made up for by your gut; 
* ask questions and try to demystify or concretize aspects of the culture of academia and your field as you focus on the training; 
* set aside time and energy for self-care and socializing, with an intentional effort to developing friendships or accessing outlets that nurture your culture and ""true"" self that you don't have a chance to relate to others with in your program (probably); 
* relish that you do get to play and have the cognitive challenge and nurture that part of you in the PhD program;
* find out if counseling is available through a health center or other program. Parts of PhD can be alienating and isolating by nature and regardless of your background. This has the potential to be magnified for you if you've already experienced some of this. Mental health problems too often develop among graduate students, so if you can afford to see someone regularly to help you transition into the program, I think that would be a good preventative move. 
* Consider how much you want to help people be more comfortable with you, or maybe you'd prefer to focus on the job at hand/common ground. Maybe that is a therapy topic. Basically, I think you might do well to play with how you handle this time around what you found to be a challenge in the past. 

I wrote this rather quickly and realize it's long. It's so long I didn't re-read for corrections, so feel free to reach out of any of this doesn't make sense. If you'd like to stay in touch just to have someone to talk to that understands where you are coming from, I imagine that would be mutually beneficial. My direct supervisor and advisor tend to ascribe to ""colorblindness,"" if that gives you any idea how many people I have around that know what this is like. 

I do think there are enough of us here to create a community, though we may be spread all across the globe. I have finally started to make time to seek out peers I have more in common with to try not feeling as lonely. Hopefully better late than never.",1,2020-06-12 05:25:03,AskAcademia

fto90az,implausibility,t2_bs9vf,"Aw, you sound like such a kind person! When I was in high school (I’m from Canada), I was super focused on my studies and had barely any social life. I continued that way for a couple of years into university, too, but I got to a point where I was so lonely and my anxiety was at an all time high. I decided to do a full 180 for third year and actually prioritize my mental health and making new friendships. It seriously helped so much and I’m now in an amazing Master’s program and so much happier.

Although it feels like secondary school is the most important thing ever right now (I remember that feeling so well), my advice is to prioritize your overall self. Work hard at school, but also take breaks for hanging out with friends, exercise, and de-stressing especially since you deal with OCD. It’ll really prevent burnout and you still have your academic whole career ahead of you to work hard. You’re also already ahead of a lot of people because you know what you want to do, I didn’t know until my third or fourth year tbh. 

I think a good plan would be to just get into the best university you can with the grades you end up with. Universities also care about improvement through school and your overall potential and goals, so really stress that in your application since you already have incredible drive. Then, once you get to university, think of it as a fresh start. Get to know profs outside of class, ask about research opportunities, and learn as much as you can, but also take care of yourself. By the time you’re looking at grad schools, you’ll be in excellent shape and no one will care  at all about your secondary school grades.

I’m a computer scientist, so I can’t give you much in the way of resources, but it seems like you’re on the right track with your tutor. You’ll get there, I promise. :) Feel free to DM me if you want to chat more!

Edit: Btw, you feeling like a poser is called imposter syndrome and everyone I know in academia has it. Even profs who have been in the field for 40 years think they don’t belong with their fellow profs. I was struggling with it super hard this year, but I tried to reframe it as me being excited to learn. I could avoid reaching for my goals because I’m scared I don’t belong, or I could take it as an opportunity to learn from the really smart people around me. Then, I’m always improving which is really the best we can ask ourselves to do.",1,2020-06-11 07:21:03,AskAcademia

ftag002,YourMomSmellsNice,t2_46j2i95,"Well, it was not one isolated event, but the overall exhaustion that came from it. I got the dog out of a combination of loneliness (even though I had a roommate) and a very bad breakup. I figured that the dog would be good for my mental health and, you guessed it, would ensure that I got outside more.

What I really got out of having a dog was more anxiety. I ran out of people I could ask to babysit (having a roommate helped a bit but she was busy as hell... and doggy hotels are not always an option on a grad student budget), walking the dog for his potty breaks ended up being more taxing than I expected, (it is daily, and you have to do it regardless of weather, your deadlines, or your own health), and just the constant worry of leaving the dog alone for too long made me both feel anxious and guilty for not being a good dog owner. At some point I tried just working from home instead of the office, but it further isolated me from labmates, friends, my advisor, and collaborators that I would regularly see in the building. Also, just like a lot of people who are now working from home during the pandemic, the dog would not let me concentrate even when it was in its crate. I won't even go about the overall cost of owning a dog, or the extra logistics that it needs when you move apartments/get into relationships/take a weekend trip/get an internship/go to a conference.

So yes, I got a dog that ensured I took breaks, but it also could not get out of those breaks on days that I needed to either have some rest or work more than usual.

It seems however that you really want a dog and you may be looking into success stories. While it didn't work for me, the times I saw it work was with friends that had gotten a dog with someone else (because they could split chores, finances, and schedules), or people that didn't mind spending a significant chunk of their time and income on the dog instead of themselves. The one friend that got a dog by himself was happy about it but made a ton of sacrifices around the dog. 

Out of 5 friends with dogs, 4 got their dog on their last year of school. All of them, however, admitted that a dog came with sacrifices. Out of those 4, 3 have graduated and find it much easier to care for their dogs because they earn more and they have a more flexible schedule.

Bottom line, I heavily suggest that you keep your sight on the prize: graduation. Focus on the number one goal so you can get out soon. Then you can own a dog in a less stressful environment.

fw1mnr6,polyphonal,t2_bvkqt,"&gt; I emailed and applied to over 30 places.

The thing is, you didn't actually *apply* to over 30 places if you weren't applying directly to posted, funded jobs.  All you did was ask 30 places if they *happen* to have a job available at the moment.  The fact that they didn't is no big surprise:  if you have a funded grant and a need to get some work done, you don't just sit around on your money waiting for people to email you.  

The typical lab probably hires what, one postdoc per year?  And they'll have that job open for, let's say, a month?   So the odds of you happening to hit a lab that happens to have an unadvertised open position is maybe 10% at best.  But then, some places with funding will already have a candidate lined up.  Some places simply won't (or aren't permitted to) hire without advertising.  So that number is realistically probably a lot lower.

I suggest you focus on applying to actual advertised, funded postdoc jobs.  It'll be a far better use of your time and you'll be able to clearly target your application to their needs based on the job description.

Out of curiosity, though--how many people actually want to become *History* professors?

&gt; Will you make it? It's anyone's guess.

OK; understood.

&gt; I saw mediocre graduate students advance to tenure track positions because they had great time management and interpersonal skills and people wanted them as a long-term coworker. I saw brilliant students who were too stubborn to take feedback on their work, or who became crippled by mental health problems, or any number of life events that kept them out of a college teaching position.

OK; understood; frankly, all of this certainly makes sense!

&gt; I think working after college is a great idea. Get some money, get some experience, and recover from college in general. After a few years you might not want to go back at all, or you might feel even more determined to pursue your goals - either way, you'll have a better idea of whether you want to do it after a break.

ebmqtem,RiskyCelery,t2_2kr0f8sk,"I'm not in the field, but I'm going to counter everyone's advice telling you not to drop out. If you know you are miserable, don't have a good working relationship with advisors/your committee, don't see yourself as a chemical engineer, and aren't performing well, now is the best time to leave. Don't fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy. You absolutely do not have to be miserable in grad school, and feeling awful is not a prerequisite to success. 

I think the answer to your first question is no. Other posters have said you won't need more pre-reqs, so consider taking some grad level courses as a non-degree student to make up for your subpar grades this semester. Make sure your mental health struggles are documented so you can submit those in explanation as well.

See if you can get a research assistant type job while you get your mental health under control and prepare to apply to new programs. This will give you experience and the ability to write something like ""I thought I was interested in ChE due to my work on XYZ in undergrad. However, after exploring \[drug synthesis/pharmaceutical technology\] while working in X Laboratories, I now know I am most excited about answering research questions about ABC."" But again, I don't know the field, so this may be stupid advice. 

In my opinion, you can treat this all as a learning experience. You're very young, and now you know more about what type of work you want to do and what type of work environment you need. I think you will have more success if you leave now, pull yourself together, and start somewhere new than if you slog through this program doing poorly because you are uninterested in the work and ineffectively supported.

fbmbhsb,sagaciux,t2_yw2qr,"This is more from the student's perspective, but complaints may also be due to a perception that the exam was unfair. I fully believe that educators are most respected because of their fairness, not their ""niceness"". A large part of this is laying out clear expectations for what students are expected to do, and providing sufficient material (lectures, notes, problem sets, etc.) to demonstrate the standard that is expected.

While students are responsible for preparing thoroughly for their courses, there are many reasons why this may not happen (work, mental health, or immaturity, for example). Students may be under a great deal of pressure to achieve a certain grade, whether due to family or scholarships or entrance requirements. Final exams can be especially stressful given that they are typically worth 50% of the overall grade. A student may not study beyond the notes, problem sets, and/or past exams of the course, and as a result perform worse on an unexpected set of exam questions. In this context it isn't surprising for students to have a strong emotional reaction.

I would not advocate for making exams easier, especially for the sake of grades, but I do believe exams should be predictable to a certain degree. Stress is counterproductive to learning, and preparing for assessments is not always equivalent to deep and persistent learning. Shifting difficulty and grade weight towards midterms, quizzes, and assignments, especially earlier in the semester when there is less time pressure, can help reduce the stress and importance of the final exam. Providing detailed expectations, exemplars of quality work, prompt feedback, and a general sense of compassion towards students will go a long way to ease the pain of difficulty. Most importantly, students will respect a fair educator and a fair assessment, and this fairness can even inspire students to put in enormous effort to overcome difficult material.",1,2019-12-22 02:22:05,AskAcademia

fcklc0l,AcademicX,t2_3pdjhx3w,"I think students don't realize that teaching and grading papers are not the only things that we do.  Professors have to do research, write and revise papers for publication if we ever hope to get a raise/promotion, and do committee work for the university and our department which often also requires reports.  When we aren't in the office or the classroom we aren't enjoying a bunch of free time.  

Based upon these responsibilities, we organize our semesters so that we have certain weeks for grading, certain weeks for research and writing, etc.  And, yes, we try our best to schedule some vacation/family time for our own mental health.  We deserve free time, too.  As students know, constantly reading, researching, and writing papers is mentally exhausting.  We are not at our own personal best or good for our families when we are stretched too thin. 

When we are near the end of the semester and are beginning to mentally unwind  as we prepare for our own break, it is so frustrating when emails and office visits begin pouring in from students who never talked to us before but suddenly want to give excuses as to why they should be allowed to submit late work.  It is never just one student asking for these extra considerations, either--students think they are the only one trying to negotiate more time/a better grade--but there are always *at least* two in every class that are haggling with us via email or in person. 

Depending upon the assignment/exam, late grading could take up a good chunk of a day.  We have to to get final grades submitted by a specific date or else we have to go the extra layer of doing grade changes, and some departments get in trouble for having too many faculty grade change submissions, so we are hustling to get everything graded by a certain date.  Now all of a sudden we have at least six late papers/exams to grade if we want to meet the deadline for grading, and our ""day off"" or our entire weekend is now spent grading late work even though we did *our* job and had everything grading on time.  

Do I love my students? YES, I do--I love my job, I love seeing students succeed, I love when they are still using me for job or grad school references years later because I had such a positive influence on their lives.  But, I absolutely feel broken down by the haggling process at the end of every semester when I have to tell my own kids no, I can't come to your class party, or no, I can no longer be a chaperone for your field trip, because I still have more grading to do in order to meet university deadlines--grading that would have been done if everything had been submitted when due. 

Sometimes I wonder if I should explain this to students at the beginning of a semester?  Most of them are too young to understand if I were to try to explain that I need my down time, too, my kids and spouse would like to have the time I promised to them dedicated only to them, etc.  Maybe students will be able to think back and remember what it was like when their mom was the only one who didn't help out at the holiday party, or their dad worked through the weekend and missed a family event he was supposed to participate in?

fcuczg7,Brett_Hoover_PhD,t2_1jxh5ct,"My perspective is from the US, and not in biotech. So I don't know how directly relevant it is.  
  
My opinion is that if you feel uneasy about pursuing a PhD, it is not in your best interest to pursue it. You are right to recognize that the tenure track professor job market is extremely competitive. I don't think professors do a good enough job of explaining just how competitive the market is, and what the chances of success are for their students to break into it. A lot of professors know nothing but academia, and went through the hiring process many years ago when the market may have been very different. Or they are superstars who have an experience with the job market that is very different from the majority of tenure track applicants. There simply aren't enough tenure track jobs to meet the supply of PhDs, not by a long shot, and the majority of PhDs won't have these jobs. And the ones who *do* get a tenure track job may find themselves being exploited by departments who see the junior professor as a captive asset, loading them up with job duties that cause serious harm to their work/life balance and mental health. What are you going to do, leave? You're lucky to have the job you've got, right? So you're a horse, and no matter how fast you run, they keep whipping you to go faster. Universities (in the US, at least) are transitioning away from tenure track positions and toward part-time lecturer-pool and adjunct positions, which reduces costs on their end by offering a pittance to the large number of underemployed PhDs in the work force to compete for teaching a class here, a class there, with no job security and few if any benefits. It's bleak.  
  
If you're interested in changing career paths, I think you owe it to yourself to research your options.

fc328r9,episcopa,t2_b5xah,"A couple commenters on this thread have mentioned harassment from the alt-right. This is a very real possibility, depending on your subfield or specialty. I always assumed my lectures were being recorded, and recorded them myself in order to have my full comments in context if they were ever used against me. I also saw my colleagues and some of my committee members included in lists of scholars compiled by prominent right wing organizations. 

As for sexual harassment and other forms of abuse- you have to remember that your advisor will have total control over your course of study, your ability to graduate, your ability to get a job once you graduate, and, in some cases, your ability to keep that job upon graduation. S/he operates according to a set of unwritten rules, with little or no oversight, and is accountable to no one. 

So yes, sexual harassment, exploitation, and abuse is a possibility. This could range from inappropriate comments to microaggressions up to full on assault. Yes, full on harassment or assault is rare. But asking students to run inappropriate errands (like babysitting for free, fetching coffee, picking people up from the airport) is not so rare, and tends to affect female and minority students more often.

I don’t think extra credit assignments should move someone up a whole grade (unless they’re large enough assignments), but not offering them at all is quite harsh. I don’t assume all of my students are full time students whose parents just pay for their full rides so they can just focus on school. I’ve seen students who work full time, who are parents, who have health problems, etc. I don’t get why giving them options is so bad. Lazy students who don’t care usually won’t take the extra credit opportunities (if they’re actual assignments, and not just a survey or something easy). Usually it is students who really do care and are trying their best to do well who will benefit, and I certainly want those people to succeed. I’m sorry your enlightened colleagues disagree, and I’m even sorrier for the student who is working 40 hours per week and going to school full time who are working super hard and trying their best to do well despite their circumstances.

I worked full time (had to, had no choice), went to school full time (otherwise I would lose financial aid) and volunteered as an RA in a lab (so strengthen my application for grad school). I was eventually hospitalized for a couple weeks, and missed two assignments for one of my classes leading up to the hospitalization. I asked the professor if I could turn in the assignments for partial credit and write a research paper (topic of his choice) for extra credit (so I could pass the class). I didn’t ask for a freebie.

It happens sometimes that students who are already struggling with their mental health expect professors to act in a parental or therapist role. I had one student in particular a couple years ago who I can only describe as ""clingy"" in ways that made me very uncomfortable. He was a close talker to begin with, but would also want to sit right next to me (I mean right next to me... even in a room where there were lots of seats available so you could have one in between you and still communicate just fine), came to office hours often, and at the same time was prone to frustrated outbursts. It was a bit scary, though I think from his perspective he was just awkward and didn't understand social cues well. 

A bigger issue for myself and other academics in my social science field is harassment from the alt-right. Many of us have been targeted at different times because we do research that relates to racial inequality. In that sense, I would say the public aspects of the job can be very challenging. If your work is covered in alt-right sources like Breitbart or the College Fix it can quickly result in really terrifying harassment that can go on for months (or longer, in some cases). 

I think the public nature of academia lends itself to attracting weirdos. People have their assumptions about who we are and what we do and they feel entitled to us in certain ways that go beyond our role as knowledge-producers and academic researchers (especially for those of us at public universities). This includes students, who may be used to the hands-on nurturing approach of many high school teachers, or who are just generally lost and so end up looking to their professors for emotional support in ways that go beyond what most of us are comfortable with. 

It's important to note too that 99% of my interactions with students and people outside of academia are just fine. But it is the sort of thing where when it's bad, it can be really bad.

I did not understand that being unable to get out of bed all day was something one could (and should) see a doctor for. I was able to half-ass my way through the basic school system with high grades despite those now-obvious disabilities. It takes a few semesters to figure out what is going on. I think it didn't occur to anyone else that I needed help then, and it's sure as hell hard to figure that stuff out when you're under influence of a failing brain. Thankfully, I think public understand of mental health and disabilities in general has gotten a lot better now, but if an instructor could help tip off a student to seek help, they could well save that student's career. I took my F's, all 7 or 8 of them throughout, and the GPA of 2, because in my mind then, I was born ""normal"" and learning disabilities and mental health issues did not apply to me. No one said anything otherwise for a long time...

Ultimately, I still ended up where I wanted to be, it just took a lot of extra work on part of people who wanted to recruit me to grad school and research. Life's complicated, and I get that it shouldn't be a lecturer's job to negotiate social and psychological issues, but the reality is that as an instructor (or even TA) you are in a position to seriously help some of your students in ways that go beyond the narrow topic of any given course, and it would be a shame to not at least occasionally take advantage of that.

fc7khx6,m_i_k_e1,t2_3o24l1uc,"I'm seeing this post after the updates, ya that students gets the grade they deserve :/

I struggled with mental health all throughout college. The only reason I passed is because my professors were flexible and helped me out. I always talked to them ahead of time though, asking for extensions prior to the due dates and always putting in my best effort when I could do my work. Sometimes I'd get some points deducted from a late paper but I still put the effort in to fully complete the assignment. I wouldn't have been able to get through college without the professors flexibility but I still feel I earned my degree. I did all the work the other students did; it's just sometimes it took me a bit longer to succeed. 

My department had quite flexible attendance policies. When my depressive episodes hit the worst it was hard for me to get out of bed in the morning and when my anxiety was bad I might be physically in class but not mentally present. I was pretty consistent with communicating with my professors about all this and would talk to them during their office hours. As long as I was showing I was engaging with the material they were teaching and meeting the learning goals they set for the course they typically wouldn't deduct points for attendance. When I was well I'd share thoughtful ideas and ask good questions quite regularly. My professors got to know me pretty well and by the time I was in my junior and senior years some professors were able to read me pretty well and would check in if they noticed something was off. 

Sometimes I would be doing really poorly. In those times I'd talk to my professors and be honest. What would it take for me to get a B- in their class that semester? I wouldn't expect them to just give me an A just because and I wouldn't ask for that. I'd lower my goals, disengage a big more than normal, and focus on doing what I needed to to get better. My professors would know this and sometimes they'd let me know how to complete an assignment in a way that would take less time but still get me a passing grade. If I had a 90% in the class thus far they might let me know that if i turned in a big assignment that was a page or two short or a week late i could get a 70% on it and still get a B- or better in the class. Other times I'd be doing well, get really excited about a project, and go well above and beyond the expectations. I finished college with a 3.5

Through all this I developed some serious life and communication skills that help me as a post college adult. I'm better able to assess what commitments I can and can't keep before making them. I'm able to be honest upfront with people. I know my limitations well and know how much I can reasonably take on. I know my cycles and really take advantage of when I'm doing well to set myself up to still be fine when I'm not. I'm about to set boundaries and know how to ask for help in a fair way. 

I'm really thankful for the flexibility of my professors. I would have dropped out sophomore or junior year without their support. It was a give and take though. If I wasn't communicating with them and turning in quality work I don't think they would have been able to or should have let me pass their classes. 

It seems you do let students know you'll work with them if they talk to you about it. I'd suggest really emphasizing that at the beginning of the semester. No one is just a student; everyone has many complex sides to them and sometimes that interferes with their course work.

You aren't ready for grad school. Academia is stressful and emotionally draining. You'll receive criticism, rejection, and you'll need to be able to resolve conflict in a mature and professional manner. 

You also need to be flexible. Yes you'll have some choice, but you can't have everything your way. So far you've been very rigid and refused to consider anything outside this ideal plan you've created in your head, e.g. insisting on having a retired professor as your supervisor.

I empathise with you, I struggle with anxiety, depression, and PTSD. It does make things harder (in academia and other areas of life), but it will only stop you from achieving your goals if you let it. If you're struggling this much just with the admissions process, doing an actual research program in the state you're in now will be a complete disaster. 

My advice would be to take a couple of years off, work on your mental health, mature a bit more, then reconsider grad school. If this is something that you really want then you need to learn to manage your anxiety. You've mentioned not wanting to leave your hometown, you might not necessarily have to but you should be at least open to considering it should an ideal opportunity arise. If staying put is that important to you and you're not willing to compromise, that's OK too. Academia might not be for you. You're obviously not ready to leave anytime soon, so go find a job, work, pay off student loans/save some money until you figure out what your next move is. 

You seem quite young (how old are you?), plenty of time to decide what to do with the rest of your life. I completed undergrad at 25, worked for 2 years, went back to masters at 27, don't expect to finish until I'm 30. I'll definitely do the same before beginning a PhD as well, so I'll likely be in my early 40s by the time I complete it. You are freaking out about having your career path perfectly planned out but this isn't necessary. You just need a general idea of what you might like to do (which it seems like you have), and a plan for the next few months/years to put you in that direction.

f41udrn,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"Some thoughts:

1. How much of a time commitment is this? Doing 10 or so hours per week as a volunteer (and being able to hold a job on top of it) to gain additional research experience before applying to graduate schools may be worthwhile, particularly if you don't have a lot of research experience to-date. If we're talking full-time 40 hours per week, I would consider it completely unreasonable to expect someone with a Bachelor's degree to put in that amount of labor without compensation. (By the way, when they say they may at some point pay you, I would operate under the assumption that that will not happen.)

2. Consider looking for jobs that may have connections to the clinical side of your interests, for example, at community mental health organizations or other relevant nonprofits. That is a way to both pay the bills and continue gaining experience that will strengthen your graduate school applications.

3. If you don't have a lot of research experience, one potential avenue would be to complete a Masters program first. That way, you can gain research experience as a graduate student, and apply for Ph.D. programs as a stronger candidate with more research experience under your belt.

4. It sounds like you're experiencing some success looking for paid positions (congrats on the interview yesterday!). Certainly, a paid RA position would be a good option. If you're getting to the interview round, odds are that you're a good candidate for these types of positions. If you haven't already done so, consider seeing if there is someone who can look over your materials and rehearse interview questions with you to give you some feedback. I'm not sure when you're  graduating, but if it's in the spring, there is still plenty of time to find a paid RA position for after you graduate--new opportunities may come up between now and then.",1,2019-10-17 14:52:48,AskAcademia
f43e1u8,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"1. I'd be hesitant to do 20hrs/week unpaid. Consider also that you're working and will be spending time and money on the application process, too. I don't think the number of hours you work will be what matters so much as the experience you have and the quality of a letter of recommendation you might get. (E.g., working fewer hours but more closely with a faculty member is likely better, especially if you're not being paid.)

2. Does your college have career center services available to recent graduates? If so, I'd recommend seeing if they can help you find jobs at community mental health agencies or other relevant places. (Likewise, they may be of some help in finding RA positions.)

3. While clinical psychology Ph.D. programs are, of course, highly competitive, it is possible that you are underestimating your strength as an applicant. I did not have any publications when I applied for graduate schools. If your application checks out in other areas (e.g., still having research experience, strong GPA and GRE scores, strong LORs, etc.), getting an RA position may not be essential to your application (though of course, it still would help).

4. If you're getting a large number of interviews but not receiving any job offers, you might consider doing a mock interview with someone (again, consider seeing if this is a service your college's career center offers to recent alumni). It certainly could be the luck of the draw. But in the event that your responses or the way you come across in interviews might be affecting your odds, you can receive some feedback.

f48lmr8,smbtuckma,t2_78490,"Speaking as someone training in psychology, your psychologist's suggestion makes me uncomfortable. It is super disempowering to your patient to suggest that there is only one they can do. And I think they're probably wrong in a couple ways: 

1) If your situation is truly so disabling that almost all jobs are off the table, then academia is definitely out of the question too. As other people said here, there's a lot of social interaction as an academic - the ""lone thinker in an ivory tower"" is a myth about how academia works. You haven't seen any ""dirty office politics"" quite like two professors with a 20-year grudge over the most inconsequential things. The amount of stress in graduate school is also super high and no one should enter a PhD if they're not prepared to manage strong depression and anxiety (not everyone has a bad time, but more than 50% of grad students are diagnosed with depression). I think it was on /r/gradschool where a student on the spectrum shared their spreadsheeting attempt to manage their anxiety - nearly every day was marked with a panic attack or meltdown. I wouldn't trust the base rates you see on reddit of Asperger success in academia vs. other careers, cuz it's a stereotype people love to talk about.

2) You're probably not so bad that most jobs are closed to you, however. You said you're in customer service specifically. That's a hugely draining job to do, even for the most gregarious people. There are so many other positions, even other ""regular office jobs,"" that are a better experience. They'll put you in social situations, every job does, but not in ones that are so fraught or constant as customer service. So you could probably do a PhD if you deeply love your field and want to do research in it. But ""it's the only job I think I can do"" is not a healthy reason and would greatly raise your risk of distress and burnout. There are a ton of other stuff you could do I bet as long as you get out of customer service. Not MBA-specific, but my sister is on the spectrum and she's loving her position as a zookeeper. Social situations were so much easier for her when she didn't have so much background stress to manage. 

So academia could be a good idea for you if you want to enter for its own sake, but I suspect you're not getting the best of advice from your psychologist. I am not your doctor, but you might want to seek second opinions from other mental health professionals and more specifically from neuro-divergent individuals in academia.",1,2019-10-18 23:42:32,AskAcademia
f49h13r,Experimentalphone,t2_24o20tpg,"&gt; you might want to seek second opinions from other mental health professionals and more specifically from neuro-divergent individuals in academia.

I actually did get a second opinion and while talking things through they said that Academia would be the most suitable. 

My psychologist actually meant well. My mental health has turned really bad after joining my current job and two years in and I still cannot bear the daily job. Given my whole situation including aptitude, strengths, interests and all academia was suggested. He did not say it was the only one, just that academia would be the best fit for a lifelong career compared to all others. In academia even if my social skills faltered I would be able to rise given my research aptitude but in the business world the lack of social skills would be an instant obstacle to rising up. 

Although now that you say that people in Academia should be able to handle depression and anxiety this makes me really concerned. I already have depression so could you explain how bad would it be on the mental health of a person who is already depressed?

Also, I am not on the autism spectrum. I just meant that my social skills are really low similar to someone on the spectrum. I mainly have OCD and its quite severe and accompanied by depression.",1,2019-10-19 06:18:24,AskAcademia

It depends on the field. I will say that for STEM fields (particularly engineering) your math skills go out the window **fast**. In addition, it seems like it's hard to go out and get a real job and *then* go back to living like a college student for a few more years. Your mileage may vary.

Since you're shifting from Sociology &gt; IT, yes, you're going to have to prove that you're ready to do masters level work in IT. You need to show them you have the training and experience that will make you a successful student in their program.

I know lots of people who did this kind of lateral shift... but usually, they had some kind of life experience in their field-of-interest that made them a good candidate (rather than just ""interest + enthusiasm""). E.g. someone with a BA in math, but who worked in mental health for 10 years after, and then entered a graduate program on it.

A friend shifted from sociology &gt; wildlife biology, but before he entered his masters, he had a bunch of years of literally going-to-the-jungle-to-study-shit that made him a killer candidate. He had no problem getting a masters acceptance, even with a social science bachelors.

Take major steps to show a potential grad program you're serious. Tons of web development skills just need to be learned, practiced, and honed. Do you have a portfolio? Masters programs aren't designed to teach you the 101, they're designed to sharpen and enhance the skills you already have (ideally). Most programs will welcome a candidate who can demonstrate they're ready to succeed within the program, even if they don't have a background in the exact same field.

f2e2if8,beimpermissible,t2_6nmec,"I can't speak to decades. I've only been teaching for about 15 years, give or take.

In that time, I've taught 30-odd sections of 20+ different courses, grad and undergrad. Only a few of them have I taught more than once or twice--and with those, to be honest, it's mostly been great: I just keep refining the course, seeing what's worked and what hasn't, tinkering with my own sense of what I want and of who my students are, revising as the students themselves change. It's pretty intrinsically interesting.

Personally, if anything I was teaching got truly boring (I don't mean a bad semester or whatever: I mean really boring), I'd just stop teaching that and teach other things--or, if stuck with a course for some reason, would start teaching it totally differently in ways I thought would be interesting.

In fairness, all of my courses are organized (to one degree or another) around live questions for the discipline (which I try to pitch at different levels to meet students where they're at), so they're kind of by definition interesting to me, at least.

For the life stuff, it's harder.

My little brother killed himself in my second year as a professor. My parents are in the middle of getting a divorce right now (granted, I'm an adult and they're their own people, but still: it's weirdly difficult). I've had some deeply rough patches in my own relationships, including one that ended when I was in grad school and taught a lot of courses and, at various points as faculty, in my marriage. We're all living, collectively, on borrowed time--both as higher ed and, still more, with regard to climate catastrophe and likely associated social disruptions.

It can be hard to live with the difficulties of being somebody while also going in and setting up conditions where students can have transformative (or at least intellectually useful and personally meaningful) experiences.

Some people compartmentalize hardcore. They treat their teaching persona and teaching life as fundamentally separate from their larger self, and sort of set aside other aspects of their lives in order to teach effectively.

Personally, I find that heavy-duty compartmentalizing doesn't work very well for me. I live a more satisfying life when I am pretty much who I am across all domains of it, when I'm well-integrated. That said, to a certain extent, there's no way around it--if you're having a really hard time, you can't just drop that onto your students' shoulders. So, some compartmentalizing is necessary. If you just had a rough argument with your partner or with a colleague, you can't come in and offload that on students.

But, again for me personally, I need to be a pretty well-integrated person or else I kind of fall apart. That's especially true for the big stuff, but also means that I try to work through moods I'm having before teaching (instead of stuffing feelings or just setting them aside).

I pray before I teach, asking whatever it is that helps me to help me get out of the way and offer something useful to my students. Often, what happens is that aspects of my own personal difficulties (when these arise) then get incorporated into the work of the classroom--not explicitly, but as a kind of private subtext. Other times (like with talking about climate change or overtly destigmatizing mental health difficulties for my students), I end up talking pretty directly with my students about the things that comprise my various crises (in general, but not so much in a ""here's my life"" way, except when my little brother died--I had to leave for the funeral, and there was no functional way to avoid disclosing that; my students were very kind to me when I returned).

For the lecture thing, I dunno. I give impromptu lectures about things that students seem to be struggling with, but for the most part we do a lot of active classroom stuff. I'm still ""on,"" but it's not quite the same.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that, in my experience, it's an entirely feasible to be a professor and be a ""whole person"" (at least, to the extent that this is feasible for any labor under capitalism).

What's going on with the rest of your life? What communities do you belong to? What hobbies do you have? It sounds like you have put all your eggs into your education basket and now you don't know what your life is about. You need to go and figure that out. Those recommending therapy are likely spot on.

My own 2 cents on what it is to live a good life:

Work the Body.  Be physically active and have physical goals you work towards. For many this can be sports, yoga, martial arts, running, biking, hiking. You get a social bonus if things involve a group. Physical health improves mental health. This also means eating healthy too.

Work the Mind. Have meaningful conversations. Play challenging games with people. Write. Read. Be creative with art or crafts. Meditate. Get therapy. Keeping the mind active promotes health.

Be Productive. Productivity with the goal to acquire an art or skill allows for a sense of accomplishment. Making things to enjoy or for others, making art, doing things with your hands can be intrinsically rewarding and entertaining in ways that video games and other activities are not. Even cleaning or gardening can be satisfying for some. For some, this may be their careers or volunteer work. A small sense of accomplishment now and then does wonders for esteem.

Belong. Belong to a group or community. Maybe this is a sports group, gamer group, social group. You need time spent socializing with someone around an interest or due to family or friendly bonds. Humans are social animals and we are meant to have a tribe.

Lastly, strike a balance between the physical, mental, social, and productive aspects of your life. This will need to be re-tailored again and again and again. It's hard to live a good life, but I doubt there is another way to it. You don't have to have it all together all the time, and life changes always. The important thing is to find those things that help you feel balanced. Get help when you need it to get back on track. Good luck and live your best life!",1,2019-10-10 00:52:14,AskAcademia
f3608c2,superyelloduck,t2_daz8c,"I applied for a PhD at Cambridge on a whim. I didn't get in, but I am now at a less prestigious uni (it's one of the best in Scotland however). I was surprised that I even got an interview. My grades are pretty decent sure, but I didn't have any publications to my name, and hadn't worked in a lab outside my BSc and MSc projects. What seemed to be very important in my case was fit. There is no doubt that I would have made a good fit in the lab itself - my research interests aligned very well what what they do - which may be why I was interviewed. I can't say whether or not I would have fit in *socially,* and will never know. 

I gather that one of the best skills you could have for Oxbridge is what my supervisor calls the ""bullshit meter"". Essentially, if you can critically analyse other studies and say why they are poor (could be design, analysis... anything really), they REALLY like that at Oxbridge. It seems to be (whether rightly or wrongly) that Oxbridge make the standard. They tell you what they do, and why everyone should do it, and you're incorrect otherwise. I don't mean to sound bitter FYI, but I have noticed this with other universities of similar prestige (my supervisor experienced this first hand in his PhD). 

In terms of groundbreaking work, I guess it comes down a lot to the collaborations and work ethic that Oxbridge has formed. Let's face it - not everyone is an Einstein, but through work with other researchers etc, maybe you'll be part of a group that is as smart. 

I am almost certain that those that attend universities like Oxbridge will have similar struggles to those in other places - certainly cost of living is much higher than in other parts of the UK, and there will be more internalised pressure to do well which is likely to affect mental health. 

I don't think there is a particular TYPE of person that Oxbridge will avoid - certainly it will attract certain types of applicants anyway (good GPA, hard worker etc). But I don't think anyone should be discouraged from applying. If you think you'll be a good fit, and you have identified a research team you'd like to work with, there's no harm in applying (except the application fee which doesn't happen at other UK institutions).

So, if it's any consolation to you, you're post helped me realize that I'm not the only one that this has happened to. 

While I don't have a mental health background, based on your post, it sounds like you may have clinical depression and anxiety. Both of these conditions can impair executive functioning (memory and concentration etc.), but this does not reflect your aptitude or mean that you shouldn't be in college or graduate school. 

The first step is to get documentation of your mental health conditions and register with DRC. You may be able to get an extension on your assignments or even a grade of I. (Once you complete your assignments, the I is replaced by the new grade.) The sooner you do this, the better your outcome will be. You don't have to disclose your mental health diagnosis to your professors either . They'll only know that you requested and were granted certain accommodation through the DRC.  If you're comfortable explaining your conditions in more depth, that's your choice, but I just wanted to let you know that the school will not disclose any personal/medical information (even if accommodations are granted).

f7yb1ln,zazzlekdazzle,t2_4x68b,"&gt; Also as a side note, while reading the and you followup comments I do tend to get the feeling this student is annoying/irretating you

Reddit is so confusing, everyone else here is telling me I'm too sympathetic. 

Anyway, I don't have anything against him personally at all. I am aware of students with extenuating circumstances and I also have a section on the syllabus about this. Here I say that I realize that a student have special circumstances - including, but not limited to, issues with health (physical or mental) and family. My policy as stated there is that the student needs to come to me as early as they can and, in return, I will make accommodations for them including personal tutorials and moving deadlines for them. I specifically say that this is best for the student because I cannot change their grades retroactively. 

To his credit, he contacted me relatively early (although I had already marked him as having likely dropped the class due to his absences) and I designed a new curriculum for him that required a minimum of attendance in the class (otherwise I have a relatively strict attendance policy) and other accommodations. He did not respond. I followed up on my own with him in person and I took the time to run the numbers to see what he needed to do and when to the grade he needed, and he accepted. When he was not able to do this specialized minimum amount of work, I followed-up via email, and he did not respond. 

One of the classes he had to attend was when I gave the midterm. He did not come and did not let me know before or after what the situation is. The issue is not that he is failing per se, but that he is failing by a very large margin due to him just not doing anything and not telling me anything about it, even when I make an overture. Surely a professional with a family has the organizational capabilities to tell his professor he's not going to show up for an exam or why he can't hand in an assignment? 

I understand students have extenuating circumstances, but he has to do a certain minimum and I don't even mean doing any work for the class at all, just letting me know what's going on. Sure, he has a lot going on, he has a job and young daughter and he needs to take this class even though it doesn't fit in his schedule. But surely he has the time to write me a few emails throughout the semester to even let me know what's going on.

He is entitled to do an EC assignment according to my own syllabus, but how much of my time and effort for special attention and accommodations is he entitled to? I would have met with him on my own time and tutored him to catch-up with the material, and he knows this. All that said, you are probably right that he is entitled and I have to let him do it, even if means more effort for me when he has done almost nothing on his end to work towards passing the class. I have had many non-traditional students and many with special circumstances, but I have never had a student who puts in so little for a class, he is getting a 22 (out of 100) right now.",1,2019-11-18 15:31:04,AskAcademia
fbhcyz9,Katkool,t2_d87zw,"Point 1: You're assuming people will judge them for going to a mental health center. Maybe it depends on the region but going in for mental health is seen as a sign of personal strength and wisdom where I'm from. Even if it is, that is not always a strong reason as to why someone didn't seek out support in the first place. How is everyone supposed to know you went to the mental health center? This isn't high school, people are not concerned about social standings, and medical records are kept private for a reason. 

Point 2: It's a desperate attempt to salvage their performance because it's at the last minute. NO ONE would be talking about ethics if they had reached out anytime before or near their issues with the course. It seems desperate because if they had mental health issues and took responsibility, asking for help wouldn't come at December 20th, way after they can do anything to fix their grades. Take a look at the replies in this thread and you'll see people who have struggled with serious mental health issues and still support the professor directing them to mental health services but not automatically giving them a passing grade. The university has grades so that people who do well are recognized as doing well by the standards the university sets. Diminishing that standard reduces the hard work that students have gone through to achieve good grades and leads me to my third point.

Point 3: You claim that ""it's not like these are Oxford scientists or Yale Law students and so giving undeserved grades is ok. If college is not ""the Olympics"" as you have pointed out, then why is it so big a deal to give them a failing grade? If college is what I think it is, a 4 year experience whose value lasts for about as long as your first 1 or 2 full-time jobs, then getting an F and redoing the course later is not a big deal either by your same logic. Also are people who are in high stakes environments less deserving of empathy because of how prestigious their university is?

Point 4: You keep citing the most terrible examples of mental health that people experience in our society. That is somewhat fair, as these issues do exist and it is not possible for most of us to even comprehend what these people have gone through. This is not a strong point however because it is completely speculative. IF these students suffered terrible things, then they should get a pass, is not a strong argument. Then you also must ask, how terrible must the situation be in order to deem it worthy of an excuse? Then someone has to judge the situation, which comes all the way back to where we are now, which is to direct people to mental health resources and have someone recommend if a student should receive leniency or not. Saying ""I have mental health problems"" should not become an end-all argument as people will start to have problems with that logic and the issues surrounding mental health will take on the negative idea of ""this is an excuse"". Just yesterday I saw someone trying to con the professor into giving them a passing grade because of several illegitimate reasons but passed them off in an emotionally charged way. Also I know that it's is not fair for people who have mental health issues to suffer more than everyone else because of things they can't control. That's why we have and are developing a mental health system to try and level the playing field. I say develop because I'm certain that colleges can improve their process. 

Point 5: Saying ""get a grip"" is undeniably rude. Calling someone's ego ""fragile"" is undeniably rude. Maybe you like the burn factor a little much but if you really want to defend your opinion and your take on mental health, be more rational so that people on the other side of the argument take you seriously. I'm sure it works great for people who agree with you and want to get fired up but it is in no way a good idea for settling a disagreement. Why do you think the OP feels like replying is pointless? Because the tone of your argument suggests you're not willing to settle or compromise. 

Point 6: A lot of what's being said in this thread is tied to people relating their own similar mental health experiences.

The only reason not to go to your supervisor with something like this is if they are terrible, and yours sounds like a good one. As for what you can ask them for, you would be able to go on leave (I believe up to 6 months at least should be OK) - though you'll know better than me how your finances/visa situation would deal with that. If you find having the work helpful, you can still do it while on leave (there may be some restrictions on lab use); just a pace where it's not hurting you more.

  
You should also be able to get an extension through your university's wellbeing department (they like it if you apply &gt;6 in advance, but if you sent them basically this they should do it anyway); you'll probably have to talk a little about why you need it with them (which may not be pleasant, but they are supposed to be sensitive) and there should be a possibility of a paid extension. You don't even need your supervisor to be involved in this process if you don't want (they will obviously get told at some point why you're not having to submit on the original schedule, but you can start it yourself).

One trick I've found is that the more ""reserved"" brits (and probably all academics in general) fare better in more personal conversations if you always include some actionable point in them. So you probably shouldn't focus just on the feelings side of things (e.g. ""I'm struggling to cope and am constantly depressed"") because there isn't anything for them to *do* and they might not know how to respond. Instead, you frame your struggles in terms of something actionable, something that they can *change*, like asking them to help you set deadlines or to find a quieter space for you to work. You can definitely mention the recent loss, PTSD, even the suicide attempt if you feel comfortable, but the conversation should be rounded out with a clear action that you'd like your PI to take. 

&gt;What do you mean by 'lean' on my supervisor?

I mean, don't treat them like a counsellor or offload all of your baggage onto them. If you're sitting in their office, crying and spilling all of your bad thoughts to them, that's getting into ""leaning"" territory - where you're relying on them for emotional support rather than professional. Many PIs honestly have bad mental health themselves so they can't be relied on for your emotional health, and if you do it too much or too often, they can get more stressed too. It's a lot of responsibility, your mental wellbeing, and your PI is woefully unprepared. 

Plus, they could respond in a very unhelpful way to your concerns. When I expressed my concern that I was the weakest student in my cohort and had the worst preparation, my PI *agreed* with me. And it wasn't because he's an asshole, it's because it was the truth and he was just addressing my statement from the professional, graduate school side of things.

I ended up contacting grad students and visiting some of the labs ahead of time to make connections too and ask about their research and was often introduced to some of the faculty. (Key here being I didn't contact the professor, grad student introduced me). It was a lot of fun talking to them about their research and it also helped me understand what the stress level and mental health of the average grad student was at the University.

In the end, I got into 2/4, but the choice was easy because I found the lab and the advisor I wanted to work for and a school culture and lab culture that would be healthy for me to be successful.

If you still want to do all the applications more power to you and there is some great advice in this thread. My advice is to get a bit creative and try things that other applicants won't, like going and connecting with the people, showing genuine interest in their research, asking for informational interviews with grad students and during them see if they can show you around the lab or department or whatever your situation is. 

If you end up only applying to 8, or even the full 11, make sure you put your full heart into each application.

Right now it seems like trying to force it to work with your current institution just isn't working, and in the process of trying to fix things and mitigate the damages, you're stressing yourself out more and it's probably not helping your physical or mental health.

 It was a decent community college and I personally enjoyed the courses I took, but I was an academically inclined student who ended up graduating from a four-year university. It was nice to have some variety since the high school, which graduated about 25 seniors a year, only offered the most basic graduation requirements like English I, II, III, algebra 1, biology, chemistry, health, government, etc. I never would've been able to take a Spanish, psychology, art history, and an advanced writing course in high school if it weren't for those dual-credit classes. The problem was in the school administration's handling of those courses and the students they allowed to enroll. 

Pretty much everyone who worked at my school including the faculty and administration had been first-generation college students from blue-collar rural families themselves. Rural schools, in my experience (all 14 years of my pre-K-12 education), don't tend to attract talent from elsewhere. The people that work in the schools, basically the only jobs in town you need a university education for, are people from that town who went off to college and then came back home. They have what I call the ""working class"" view of college. People with this view see college more as job training and a ticket to the middle class rather than as education. Our principal's view when I was in high school was that we just have to get the kids as many credits on paper as possible so that they'll be closer to a degree so that they can get a good job someday. There was no emphasis on them actually learning anything or doing well or acquiring the skills that undergraduate education should improve like ability to think critically, teach yourself new things, and manage time. 

They began offering this program while I was in high school. At the beginning of this dual-credit program, only academically high-achieving juniors and seniors could seek approval to take them, and that honestly worked pretty well. Kids like me were able to take some courses that were significantly harder than what the high school offered as college prep, not to mention the variety. Pretty soon, though, that working class mindset won out and they were allowing low-achieving freshmen to take those classes and there was even talk of allowing seventh and eighth graders into them, which I think the college itself had a problem with or it might have actually happened. 

These students hadn't taken English I yet and didn't grasp the concept of capitalizing the first word in the sentence and were suddenly thrust into a sophomore-level undergraduate writing course. Not to mention that they were fourteen years old in a class designed for adults. The particular English class that I took had a lot of writing assignments based on current events. I took it as an eighteen-year-old senior. I had some of my own opinions about politics and could think about the issues we wrote about with the mental capacity of a young adult, at least as well as an undergraduate. I think that in most cases, if a fourteen-year-old has a political opinion, they're most likely just parroting what their parents say. I don't think most kids that age even understand what things like abortion even are (given that they'd not even had high school sex ed yet), let alone be able to think critically about the arguments for or against. The point of thinking critically about issues and then writing logical arguments about them was completely lost on some of the kids I knew. They may have the credit for that class on their college transcript, but they probably would've gotten a lot more out of it had they taken it a few years later with the critical thinking skills and general knowledge of the world of an adult. (Which I don't think is all that fair to people they're competing with out in the world for jobs, internships, etc. who took a similar course as an actual undergraduate and probably actually learned something). It's the difference of having a credential on paper versus actually possessing the knowledge and skills the credential implies. 

I remember in those classes from the discussion board assignments that there were more high school students than actual undergraduates enrolled. There were some undergraduates that actually were primarily enrolled in the community college, but over half the class was high school students from rural schools radiating out about two hours driving time in every direction from the metro area where that community college was located. There were kids from every school that we played sports against. They were milking dozens of rural high schools in our area. They were a public non-profit college, but dang were they engaging in what I consider to be predatory practices targeting rural schools. They must've been getting a nice stream of revenue from the high school students. Our high school paid for students to take the courses, so there was no cost to students. They had to be rolling in the dough that originated from school taxpayer dollars rather than student financial aid (found them another tuition revenue honeypot, basically). I think behind the scenes they were probably marketing to the administrators to enroll more students.",1,2019-12-10 00:39:42,AskAcademia

f84ai05,nuclearslurpee,t2_11caye,"Anecdotally, I would say that it's definitely a mix of both.

On one hand, grad school tends to be not only high-stress and mentally-taxing but also extraordinarily difficult to maintain work/life balance and separation throughout, especially with the pressure from advisors and supervisors to dedicate every waking moment to their research (I once heard a professor advise a room of students planning to pursue faculty jobs to ""set expectations"" early on by overloading new students with excessive amounts of work so they wouldn't get the idea to ""waste their time"" by *volunteering*. Yes, that is the exact example he gave for a ""waste of time""). Compared to a more typical job with similar pay (most student stipends are comparable to full-time minimum wage earnings), grad students don't usually have the luxury of leaving their work *at* work and going off the clock after an 8-hour day - some do manage this, but most do not for various reasons. On top of all this, there's tremendous career pressure to perform highly *right now* to rack up the CV items that will secure a job in the increasingly-harsh academic job market.

On the flip side, academia tends to attract particular types of people who, in my experience, seem to be especially prone to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. On one hand, you have a lot of the type-A perfectionists who are naturally susceptible to anxiety and struggle with the open-ended nature of research where clear performance feedback is often not present (did it work? You'll find out in six sleepless months!). On the other hand, you also have a lot of incredibly brainy people who managed to cruise-control even through large swathes of their undergrad curriculum and aren't used to the kind of intellectual challenge that involves beating one's head against a wall for 4-6 years. Often, these types of people also were never really forced to develop effective study habits or time-management skills, even if the work *ethic* is there the work *habits* often are lacking, and trying to form those while stressing about prelims and assays and manuscripts and code and advisors and... can lead to a lot of burnout and depression for many people.

Personally, I also believe that these issues are *criminally* under-diagnosed due to the depressing (heh) state of most student health centers/happy pill dispensaries at major universities. I won't rant since that doesn't answer your question, but this may make it harder to find those who did manage to obtain a clinical diagnosis as you asked.",1,2019-11-20 08:21:53,AskAcademia
f865a5i,nuclearslurpee,t2_11caye,"&gt; Seems far likelier that they are diagnosed more often in grad students than gen pop, as grad students generally have some form of healthcare and access to psychology/clin psych if they bother seeking it out. Also, student health is much more aggressive about these types of diagnoses because the physicians tend to be made more aware (hyper-aware?) due to in-services on student mental health.

I'll concede that to you, since admittedly I'm biased based on the few institutions I have actual experience with, where the student health center personnel are generally known for ""treating"" mental health by prescribing pills and hoping something works.

I'm not in graduate school yet, but I am admittedly partially drawn by the autonomy/flexible schedule. This is the very least of my reasons, the first and foremost being that I enjoy research in my field, but I'm the type that has to have autonomy in my life. (I've never been able to handle a ""9-5"" job; I was self employed before pursuing university.) I don't think that's as much a hallmark of mental illness as human nature, or at least personality type. What I meant by my comment, however, was that it's possible that people with anxiety/depression might be attracted by the sense of accomplishment (partially true for me as well). Although like you say, maybe the rates aren't any higher than in the general population, just diagnosed more due to better access to mental health care.

If she did all of this and he aggressively pursued her or threatened her, then I would be more sympathetic toward her. (I'm a female myself btw.) 

However, things are different when a disability is involved, especially something like Autism where social perception is affected. Everyone's assuming that OP's behavior must have been the problem, but calling the police because a student \[regardless of their gender and/or sexual orientation\]asked you out to lunch is egregious. 

OP acknowledges that he may have misread the situation because of his disability, so he probably would have respected her if she had just made it known to him that she didn't have romantic feelings toward him.

The first post we had was her having issues with a professor. She believed that a grade she received for a paper was unjustly high. The following posts gave a pretty good spiralling down. She reported the professor to the chair because she missunderstood the tone of an email and took it as unnecessary cold. The chair then reported to the Dean, and she tried to have the Chair fired, because she felt it was a misplaced action. When this file didn't lead anywhere, we later learned that she tried to have the Dean fired by contacting the Board of Trustees. When that also failed she tried to go towards the journalism route bu that failed to. So she tried the lawsuit, but that didn't lead anywhere. 

She ignored the comments on her post, had her own storyline, cherry-picked the comments she liked to answer.

She felt wronged, she felt the department and the Dean and everyone at the school should have been more understanding of her conditions and that she is owed an apology. She felt that her actions were justified, and, through it all, she expressed the feeling that the professor was most likely narcissistic or even a sociopath, because otherwise, she *would* and *should* have shown understanding and sympathy for the trouble that she(the student) felt she went through.

f8i2271,Gemini725,t2_3u2gyd0n,"Fair enough. There was one professor in undergrad. whom I particularly admired/respected. (I wanted her to be my graduate advisor, but she was retiring.) Anyway, during my last undergrad. semester, I was taking a graduate level course with a research component. (This was a history course.) However, I experienced a significant amount of stress that semester (including housing insecurity) which gave me a late start on the paper, plus I fell into a depression when I learned of this professor's retirement. All of this affected my paper, and while I received an A- on it, I knew it wasn't my best work and doubted whether she believed I could handle graduate school based on that paper. 

Nonetheless, I asked her if I could contact her in the future for a lor, and she replied ""Yes, you may contact me in the future re: grad. school applications."" I perceived this reply as tepid compared to when I had asked her to be in her graduate level course. Her reply then was ""You have been a terrific student and it would be my pleasure to continue working with you."" 

This is when my anxiety started building, so I decided that I would create another project to demonstrate that I could produce excellent work when not experiencing stress and depression. (My depression isn't clinical; it was related to her retirement.) So, I submitted a proposal to a conference I knew she was attending and asked her if she would help me find volunteers for the project. (It was an oral history project that involved interviewing college students, so I only hoped that she could send an email to her class or refer me to campus organizations etc.) Given our overall positive rapport, I expected a friendly reply, but I perceived the email as curt. The issue, if the reply was taken at face value, was that I had submitted the proposal without contacting her prior. 

So a few days later, I emailed her again, stating that I would withdraw the proposal (it was accepted for presentation) and explaining that I just wanted to better demonstrate my research/project management ability. At this point, really, I was just seeking ""reassurance"" that she wasn't upset and still willing to communicate with me. When she didn't reply in 24hrs (as she typically did), I ""panicked"" and thinking she was upset with me, I impulsively wrote to the chair to complain about her tone in a few previous emails, once in person (when she momentarily ""snapped"" at me after I paused before asking her to be my adviser) and the fact that she ignored that last email.

I was hurt/angry in the moment  (at the thought of her being angry with me), and again, she was someone whom I very much ""admired."" Anyway, I felt guilty and  was unhappy with the way he handled the situation. (He requested that she reply to the unanswered email but never addressed the core issue of if/why she was upset with me etc.). He also told me that my complaint was being ""formally recorded."" (I never consented to a formal grievance.) However, he refused to tell me how I could request a copy of this ""documentation"" and it  took me around 2 months to finally see the email exchange between him and this professor where he told her that I was repeatedly contacting the dean's office to complain about the department's lack of support for my project (not true) and requested that she submit all communications with me over the matter (and explained that he was discussing the situation with the dean). He then requested a phone conversation with her, and while I don't know what he said in that exchange, based on her email response, he told her I was accusing her of traumatizing me but agreed that she shouldn't apologize since she never knew I experienced distress.

I was not included in any part of the process, never knew what he said to her etc. However, a few weeks before her retirement, I wrote her to apologize and explained that I overreacted (and that my paper was affected by anxiety/depression.) Admittedly, I asked for a lor in this letter, but it was more to prevent myself from being hurt if she didn't respond. (I figured it would be less embarrassed/hurt if she perceived me as insincere than if I made myself truly vulnerable. In retrospect, this was a mistake because it increased the uncertainty of the matter, thereby worsening my anxiety.) 

After she didn't reply to that email (about a week later), I wrote the chair and explained to him that I felt I overreacted and wanted the professor to understand that. The psychologist (director of their clinical psychology training clinic) was even willing to speak to her on my behalf but on the condition that she requested this info. So, I asked him if she (the professor) would want to speak to the psychologist so she could explain my mental health in more detail. 

Yet the chair ignored this email, and meanwhile her retirement was nearing. So, that's when I complained to the dean about how the chair handled the situation. Meanwhile, I was reaching out to the disability resource center and student affairs, hoping that someone would reach out to this professor and explain my mental health conditions to her and how they affected me in this situation. However, the dean instructed them not to respond. I then went to the provost to complain about the dean, and finally to the Board of Regents to report how the school wasn't allowing me to rescind the grievance. (I also reached out to human resources to explain that I never consented to filing the grievance and even tried getting the local media involved to report on the effects of lax grievance policies. 

TLDR- I impulsively reported my professor the chair, felt guilty afterward, but was prevented from reversing the grievance and/or reconciling with her. 

* My shifts in perspective/mood all due to the uncertainty. Again, I don't know what the chair told her, if/why she was originally upset with me, if she's the one who didn't want to bother with this, whether her lack of response to my apology was because of the paper after etc. Their evasiveness has triggered the worst OCD episode of my life, as I can't stop thinking about this and trying to figure out what happened. 

All this is because she was someone important to me. I wouldn't have  gone to these lengths or experienced this much distress over anyone else.

* A master's in mental health counseling in a program that leads to licensure, which in most states would mean you could be a licensed practical counselor. Some of these programs may choose to give you credit for similar classes, but since most of your professional classes in clinical applications/therapy would be very different from research/experimental psychology, this probably wouldn't lop off much time.
* A master's in social work (MSW) and becoming a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW/LICSW). Takes about the same amount of time. Social workers have a little bit more flexibility in the kind of work they can get.
* A PhD in clinical or counseling psychology. You'd still be starting from pretty much scratch here - most doctoral programs likely wouldn't give you more than a semester's worth of ""credit"" for your master's. Lots of people go into PhD programs with an MA in psych and still end up taking 5-6 years.

I'd make them turn in all their missing work before I'd even consider being lenient about my grading policy, but it also would depend on what effort the individual student has made over the entire semester. Mental health issues suck, but there are plenty of people living with severe mental health disorders who do turn in their homework on time. For next semester, you should find out of your institution has a disability support services (DSS) office (or something similar) and ask them what would be appropriate to put on the syllabus. My institution has specific phrasing for syllabi that communicates that the DSS office is the point of contact for any student that may require accommodation for a physical or mental health issue. You don't have to be ""disabled"", but they will coordinate things like having extra test time for students with dyslexia or severe test anxiety or being allowed to take an incomplete and make up missed work if they had an unexpected physical or mental health issue during the semester. Students who would like any academic accommodation need to register with DSS and fill out a form that says how the impairment impacts their ability to learn/work and what accommodations they are requesting. DSS reviews the form and then confirms what, if any, accommodations are appropriate. Some cases require a doctor to confirm diagnosis, some cases get approved but have conditions attached (extra exam time, but exam must be taken same day as the rest of the class; have longer deadlines for writing assignments, but must get tutoring at university writing center and have them sign off on assignments for them to be accepted late). It is the student's responsibility to give their professor(s) a copy of their approved accommodations, if they want to. They can get approved and NOT request accommodations, but the professor isn't required to give them any special consideration unless/until they are made aware of the approved accommodations. Professor has the discretion to decide whether they will allow retroactive accommodations for a student who didn't notify them until after the fact. Students are not obligated to disclose the nature of their ""disability"" to their professors and that info is not listed on the accommodation approval confirmation letter.
Might not be a bad idea to put the contact info for student health or student counseling on the syllabus and make a point of telling students that if they are having a medical or mental health issue during the semester (regardless of if they're registered for accommodations) that impacts their ability to complete an assignment, it is their responsibility to request an extension no later than the assignment due date and requests will be handled at your discretion on a case by case basis.",1,2019-12-20 03:53:41,AskAcademia

fbfetlh,birkir,t2_3p0os,"A variety of responses from /r/professors on the same issue

&gt;most students who come to your office are unlikely to see a counselor, even if you direct them to one. There is a variety of reasons for this, from the structural (mental health resources are usually overwhelmed and understaffed, there's a stigma attached to seeking mental health counselling) to more personal. For many of them you will be the closest thing to a counselor. That isn't to say that you should start handing out health advice (though I think general stuff like trying meditation, journaling etc. is unlikely to hurt), but you can definitely lend a sympathetic ear to their problems if you're comfortable doing so.

&gt;With that being said, I would also say that you should think about and set your own boundaries (maybe even write them down somewhere) and respect them. Also try to watch out for signs of caregiver fatigue.

-

&gt;mental health issues have grown in the teenager / young adult demographics, so this doesn't surprise me. unfortunately, a lot of colleges don't have access to great mental health resources, which makes it even more difficult for the students (on top of having heavy course loads and the general pressure that comes with college).

-

&gt; It can be a really big thing to admit that you’re struggling with your mental health to even yourself, let alone a professor who you respect and don’t want to disappoint so it says a lot that he opened up to you. This student is clearly asking for help and I urge you not to throw him to the curb.
&gt; 
&gt; Directing him to the counseling center is a good start, but that’s assuming he hasn’t already tried. I’m not sure about your school, but where I am it can take weeks to actually get a CAPS appointment and they are so swamped that students aren’t allowed to schedule sessions more frequently than two weeks apart, sometimes more, and that’s only to begin getting therapy. It can take even longer to get in to see a psychiatrist, and then multiple appointments to figure out medication. At my university (and I imagine others), the process of getting evaluated and approved for official accommodations is handled through a separate office and is so long and full of red tape that it’s highly unlikely they will be in place for this student before the end of the semester. By all means connect him with these resources and encourage him to get the ball rolling for his own benefit, but in the meantime you can be supportive and compassionate with how you handle the late assignments. Withholding assistance and refusing to be flexible until you have official documentation that mandates accommodation (as some here suggest) sends a message to the student that you don’t actually care about his wellbeing until he jumps through a bunch of institutional hoops.
&gt; 
&gt; As for all the suggestions to tell him to drop the class, that’s rarely an option for most students. Even if it would be possible to drop without completely screwing himself over with credits and financial aid, it’s very possible that forcing him out of the class could do more harm than good. I had one professor in my past do this and it reinforced all of the distorted messages that my depression was telling me at the time. I was obviously a failure, no matter how hard I tried nothing was ever good enough, I was such a burden that the professor didn’t want to deal with me so she just washed her hands of the situation, I was being punished for something that wasn’t my fault, etc etc. The professors who were supportive, flexible, and encouraging, however, made a huge difference in pulling myself out of it.
&gt; 
&gt; I’m not saying you have to completely forgive any lateness in the assignments, but please allow the student to submit them and be reasonable with the amount of points that you take off. Thank him for opening up to you, remind him to take care of his heath, encourage even small victories (“I’m so glad you made it to class today” etc), and assure him that there is light at the end of the tunnel and it is still possible for him to succeed.

I do want to address another thing woven through your post.  Stop lamenting your college.

Rankings were created by U.S. News and other outlets to sell magazines. If I remember the history correctly, the magazine wasn't doing so well in the mid-1980s and created the college rankings as a way to attract more readers. The U.S. News methodology is created by the magazine editors selecting what criteria are most important to *them* and then foisting it upon everyone else. And it's no coincidence that the colleges and universities everyone already thinks are the top keep rising to the top. If schools other than the Ivy League and the popular public universities kept rising to the top, U.S. News' sales would plunge because people already have set ideas about ""top colleges."" They also rely upon data from the colleges and universities themselves. So they have a vested interest in ranking wealthy colleges highly.

*Where* you went isn't so important as what you did there, and where you went to undergrad will become even less important after you decide what to do next.

It's socially mortifying to be called out on mental deficits, especially if your self-identity is based on your intelligence, so a one-on-one start is preferable.

However, this would be better done by a peer who has known your supervisor much longer. Request confidentiality with that person, express your worries with concrete examples, and ask if they have seen a decline. Do not mention your father, as that will tempt a person to dismiss your concerns as some kind of hammer/nail fallacy.

Because this is a clinician, don't shrug. You have well-informed concerns that could affect patient health.

fawjk26,PersephoneIsNotHome,t2_5f73pl3,"One of the big issues is that a particular ""method"" done by that particular professor - well how does that transfer?  Can anyone do it and get the same results?  

So a step back and take something about education that is robustly true, which is class size.  People have done that experiment in all sorts of ways in all sorts of countries and with all kinds of teachers, ages and classes and smaller class sizes are overwhelmingly better at some order of magnitude . Very few results in education research are that robust.

Now, I say, giving practice HW is the best way.  So I give practice HW.  It seems reasonable.  If I give you questions, and you realize you don't know that, you can go look it up and know that?  But how do I actually tell if this is effective?  Some of them knew it anyway ,  Some of them didn't know it and didn't look it up (the questions are not magic, this is a process called formative assessments we are testing)  some of them just had their dog die, some of them are frankly not going to learn it no matter what you do.  So did it work?

Now lets move it to a lab, where they are selected for certain characteristics - no mental health issues, no major life issues and they have to be there for a certain amount of time with nothing but the questions and the book.  Now it works great!  But I take it back to the classroom and some them still dont learn it.

Maybe it depends on how good your questions are - maybe not all formative assessment are helpful, as a method, maybe just , um good ones, are.  So the teachers that write better questions are going to get better results, but they are also probably better teachers in other ways if they can do that also.

So it sort of has to work in a controlled situation , like a lab, but it also has to work in a real world situation, and it has to work for professors that are funny and charming (like myself) and for ones that are more serious and quiet....",1,2019-12-15 01:11:10,AskAcademia

I say this not just because of the rigorousness of the work, but because the very nature of the PhD program is conducive to exploiting grad student labor, and isolating them from friendships and support systems outside campus. The PhD student is dependent on their advisor for everything - funding, teaching opportunities, research opportunities, the ability to graduate, the ability to get a job upon graduation.

fbfcvkj,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"I largely agree with your advice here, including providing information about counseling services on campus and how you'll go about accommodations. I do want to note that it's not quite so straightforward as the counseling center notifying a professor that a student needs accommodations, though:

1. Therapists in the counseling center are required to keep almost all client information confidential. They won't just call up the student's professor.

2. It can take time to come to a diagnosis. It can often take a student a couple of weeks to get a first appointment (university counseling centers are often booked out that far in advance), and a student might see their therapist every other week. So it could take a month or longer to get things into action when a student is in distress but not in imminent crisis.

3. After going to a counselor, there are really two avenues for a student to get accommodations. First is through the Dean of Students Office. This is typically for concerns that are more situational in nature. For example, if a student experienced the loss of a loved one in the middle of the semester, they may be experiencing substantial grief and be struggling academically. The Dean of Students Office can inform professors of the student's general situation (or confirm the details from a more official source) and encourage faculty to take the student's circumstances into consideration. The second is the college's accessibility services. A student typically needs a formal diagnosis for this, which takes time to get if they don't already have one. The system works alright for, say, a student with ADHD who needs extra time for exams, they've received the diagnosis prior to the semester, and they can seek out this accommodation from the beginning of the semester. For a student who experiences a mental health concern in the middle of the semester, it can take a almost whole semester to go through all the hoops to get accommodations.

I say this all because, while it's great for students to go to the counseling center and seek support, I also think it's important to recognize that getting access to enough counseling that it begins to help (e.g., a few sessions), medication, or academic accommodations can be a long and confusing process for students, and they may be struggling academically in the meantime.",1,2019-12-20 02:04:31,AskAcademia

Most universities provide counseling and psychiatric services at a low cost, and those services have been absolutely invaluable to me as someone who has struggled with mental health myself throughout my academic career. There are also usually graduate student support groups at these institutions where you can chat with others going through the same thing.

fbf0cx0,ChodetteDickens,t2_3hjbozva,"Did they directly ask for leniency, or do you assume that this is what they’re after? I think everyone deserves empathy, but there is only so much you can do. What are your options? 

Could you offer an opportunity to do an extra credit assignment? Or maybe you could offer the whole class the option to re-do their lowest graded assignment? Or maybe, since so many people contacted you, you could offer to drop everyone in the class’ lowest grade? Or grade on a curve? Not sure. 

In the future you could build extra credit opportunities in to your syllabus so they know from the very beginning what their options are. You could also make it very clear to the students that you won’t be modifying grades last minute at the end of the semester. I went through a mental health breakdown during my degree, and did quite badly on some of my classes because of it. That said, I had an idea of how badly I was going to do way before the last week of class, so I asked for extra credit opportunities in advance. 

I had a professor who had system that I quite liked: There were 2 exams, 2 papers, and 2 presentations, and we had to pick 3 of these (we could do one of each, 2 exams and 1 paper, 2 papers and one exam, etc etc). We could choose which ones. If you did more than 3, only your highest 3 grades counted. Attendance and participation were also graded quite heavily.

fbf0khn,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"I encourage you to treat mental health like physical health or illness. If, for example, a student had the flu or sustained an injury, you'd likely take that into consideration and work with them on adjusted deadlines, etc. The same is good when a student is experiencing challenges with their mental health. And, at the same time, that doesn't mean that you have to give a student any leniency that they ask for. If a student had the flu in October, didn't turn in a major assignment, and they come to you in December asking to turn it in for full credit, you might not be inclined to do so; the same applies here.

One of the challenges, to be sure, about mental health concerns is that they may last throughout much of a semester or longer, whereas being sick is shorter. And many of the symptoms may play directly into the challenges students are having with academics (e.g., depression makes it difficult to motivate oneself to do coursework).

You ask what's different now vs. when you were an undergrad. Ultimately, there is less of a stigma about mental health concerns now than in the past, and students are more likely to talk about their mental concerns. That's a good thing! It's also good to not just accept years of sleep deprivation and junk food diets as the way college ought to be--I want my students to thrive both academically and personally. (Also at play: thanks to more access to psychological services and medications for the K-12 population, more students with mental health concerns who would not have made it to college in past generations are college students now. Again, a good thing, but it factors into things here.)

I don't think you need to call the college counseling center (but I would offer to walk a student over there if a student was experiencing an acute mental health crisis). I do think it may be worth having a conversation with students about available campus resources and encouraging them to go to the counseling center or seek out other psychological resources if they are not already doing so.

Ultimately, what this boils down to for me is a few things. 1) Have empathy and compassion for these students. They are struggling personally and, because they are struggling personally, they are struggling academically, which feels bad, too. 2) As I said before, I think it's good to work with students who are experiencing mental health challenges in the same way you would accommodate for students who experienced medical challenges. And 3) Just because a student experiences a mental health challenge during a semester does not mean you have to be lenient and adjust their grade at the end of the semester. They still need to earn their grade (including turning in all major assignments) and communicate about challenges related to the course in a timely fashion. If there is a small something you can do (e.g., accept this missing assignment later than you otherwise would have) that will help a student to pass, you might consider it. But ultimately, you can be empathetic and kind and help to connect these students with resources while also giving them the grade they have earned in the class.",1,2019-12-19 23:34:33,AskAcademia

I dealt with these issues myself for the first couple of terms of uni, but it became so bad for me that in my third term, I wasn't able to sit through any classes or exams without getting panic attacks, so I sought the advice of a doctor. At the time, we didn't know I was having panic attacks, but at the very least, it was documented. For that term, I was given an official withdrawal from my classes (after going through the appropriate channels).

It took me some time to find someone that could actually diagnose me (a psychiatrist) as my symptoms were just physical. Still, I was in seeing the doctors and following their advice. I didn't like doing this, but I knew I had to in order to be taken seriously, and to have a paper trail.

Once I was given my diagnosis, I went through the process of registering with the disability centre, where I was given accommodations to suit my needs. My professors are made aware of this at the beginning of each term, and I visit them to touch base.

Additionally, I was granted a retroactive withdrawal from my university (with the help of my psychiatrist and doctors) which means that I can ""withdraw"" from my second term of classes (which is almost 3 years ago now) because while I didn't see doctors until term 3, they agree I would have been suffering the same issues in term 2. 

If these students that e-mail you truly have mental health issues, these are the paths they can take. They need to start by seeking help at a university medical clinic. If it comes out that they do indeed have a condition that prevented them from doing well in your class, the school will take care of it for you. 

It seems nowadays everyone has ""mental health issues"" when it suits them. It does a disservice to all those who do suffer, as we are taken less seriously.

It did and still does mean the world to me that all of my professors responded with understanding and compassion and were willing to work with me so that I would not be put on academic suspension. But it was very much the case that they went out of their way to *not fail me*, not to give me an A I hadn't earned.

Those same professors were also honest and direct about the fact that I had in various ways failed to meet the expectations of the class, and that my final grade needed to reflect that. Just as much as I appreciated how kindly they responded when I reached out to them, I also genuinely appreciated and respected the fact that, while they were happy to bend where they could in order to help me, they weren't willing to throw their grading standards out the window just because I had been struggling. I had to withdraw from several classes and earned a C for the first time in my life, which really freaked me out; but also helped drive it home that I had brought this upon myself, *not* for having mental health issues in the first place, but for failing to reach out for the support I needed as soon as I realized that I was struggling. That was an important lesson for me to learn.

In terms of practical solutions, my professors dealt with this in different ways – some allowed me to take an incomplete and turn in all of the assignments I had missed over the summer, with a hit to my participation grade for the class time I had missed; some gave me a zero on the assignments I had failed to turn in, but were willing to weight the assignments I *had* turned in more heavily so that I could pass the class; some offered to switch me to pass/fail grading as long as I completed all of the work I had missed; some allowed me to withdraw from the class after the deadline to do so had already passed, to avoid having an F on my transcript.

But, again, in all of these cases I worked *very hard* to make up the work I had missed and then some, and even with all of that hard work, my transcript really suffered during those semesters. I was just relieved that I hadn't been suspended. I wouldn't have expected or frankly wanted full leniency when I knew full well that I had seriously messed up by not making arrangements with my professors from the get-go. If your students don't already feel that way, I do think that that's an important thing for them to understand. 

(In terms of reaching out to somebody with concern about these students: at my university, professors were expected to report concerns to the student's academic advisor, who would then trigger appropriate responses from student counseling/university housing/etc. Obviously the policy might not be the same everywhere, but that might not be a bad place to start.)",1,2019-12-20 01:32:22,AskAcademia

Secondly. Seriously consider taking a year out. Deferring for a year is a fairly common occurence: a fair few students will do it each year and there’s straightforward procedures in place to accommodate it (at least in the UK).

So, think about this. How does the idea of just dropping it all feel to you? Just not going to your next lectures or anything. Just stopping all the uni work? If the thought of this brings feelings of relief, then do it. Arrange to just start the final year in 2020. It’s not a failure to do this. It can, for many students, be necessary self care.

It’s not always the right solution for every student. Sometimes the idea of putting it all off is a source of anxiety rather than just getting it done. But, in my experience, deferring for a year can be really vital for many students.

Can I give you my one liner I give to crying students? 'Life is long and you are young'. You're going to likely be working until 65. That's 35 years from now. That's more than the duration of time you've spent on this planet so far. It is absolutely not now or never. (And if you do end up tenure track you can work well past 65, they can't make you stop. There's an 80 year old teaching just 1 class in my department). Maybe the path to your dream tenure job involves work experience in your early 30s that inspires your dissertation work in your late 30s. Maybe you fall in love with your career, and they end up paying for your masters and phd 6 years later. My father walked away with a master's didnt get the phd, 2 kids and 15 years later his work in a government research lab sponsored his PhD, and gave him his topic. He's retired and guest lecturing now. 

Can I give you another one liner a blogger I adore wrote once? ""Depression lies"". Don't trust what depression is saying. Depression lies and says hotline wont help, says you'll never make it, says its not worth trying. Don't listen to depression. 

Can I just keep throwing out one liners? ""Be of good courage and know that you are loved"" the director of a camp and conferance center used to say that so much that it became the motto. He was a Presbyterian minister paraphrasing a scripture quote. You have people who love you. Have courage. 

A Catholic nun once told me ""Be where your feet are"" and that has stuck with me ever since. Be present in the moment. Don't be living 10 years ahead. Take the time to be present here and now. We don't know where your path will lead you. Sometimes we get so caught up in getting plans that we may never meet we get lost. 

There are so many jobs and careers related to research that you can do with just a bachelors. What if you took a year (or 5) and saved up some money so when you do go for masters (phd postdoc whatever) you can live more comfortably. Invest in mental health and take a year off working and schooling at the same time. That experience will help you stand out as a phd candidate too, PIs love students already familiar with lab equipment and professional norms. Many workplaces pay for masters with agreement to work 5 years or pay it back. I also know many phds who thesis is based on their jobs, their work takes them parttime and sponsors the phd.

 In the US goverment research labs (air force etc) hire tons of people like this, so do some hospitals.  My city has a research hospital that just created some new partnership where they have workers who are getting faculty appointments at nearby University but keeping their lab at the hospital.

Retirement benefits vary a lot from place to place. Ours are very good, which is one reason many of us stick around: if I put in 3% of my salary it triggers a 10% match from the institution.

I'm a super-strong supporter of having a good work-life balance. So I'd like to tell you to take it easy. However, you need to deal with 2 issues: i) peer pressure of your specific group, ii) keeping up with what's needed to have a good CV.

Concerning i) there's nothing we can tell you. Peer pressure sucks. Even if you produce 10x more than everyone else in your team combined, if you regularly work less hours you'll be seen as unprofessional. Even if others reddit/tinder 5 hours per day. It sucks. I truly hope it's not your case. I can do whatever I want at work and I couldn't be more grateful. If I need to go skiing because it just snowed I just phone in and I'm set. People from another team that I go to lunch with, cannot take days off, even if planning it in advance, unless it's August, because otherwise it ""looks lazy"".

Concerning ii) this is really a critical issue. Research is like competitive sports. It makes sense to be a researcher only if you're doing world class stuff. And it does require working quite a lot. I worked 35hours/week like you for years and I was doing ok but nothing that could land me tenure or even visibility. 2 years ago I had some issues and I decided that I wanted to show what I was capable of. I worked nights and weekends (at home) and got awards, many more publications, industry partnerships etc... But it damaged my mental health so badly that I was starting to have even physical symptoms and not only psychological ones. Was it worth it? Not really 100% sure. Since december I'm slowing down and planning to live off what I've done. I wouldn't have gotten here however without working so badly those 2 years.  However my PhD publications were few and sucked... Also PhDs here are short... so maybe you've already produced something that you can live off... Just keep checking what your potential ""competitors"" for a tenure position are producing.

Also, most of my time spent working/at work is lost between ""trying to focus"" (I'm really terrible at it) and being interrupted for questions, meetings, ""fixing the lab devices"" for those that don't understand them, tutoring the student etc...

I also had a very bad mental health year during my PhD (and sought treatment), where I really ought to have taken a leave of absence for a term, for how unproductive (and generally not present) I was at that time, and I fell behind my timeline.

I did communicate this with my advisors, in person, but I did not directly say that I was dealing with depression and anxiety. I said I was having a harder time with some transitions that were going on in my life and knew that I had fallen behind. And I had a plan in mind of what I needed to do next and what was feasible to get me set up to defend. 

I was really anxious about the conversation and had some worst case scenarios built up in my head, but it went a lot more smoothly than I'd imagined. I had three advisors I worked with, all with very different personalities. All three were supportive and helpful in varying ways. Two were more direct on focusing on the timeline moving forward, and one indicated they had noticed that I'd been more withdrawn and that I should feel free to ask for support if I needed it (and mentioned the counselling services on campus, although I hadn't directly indicated it).

Firstly, since you're at the very beginning of the academic journey, I feel that it's important to keep hold of the passion and motivation for what you want to persue, and that you should work with someone who inspire you. They don't need to be perfect (your last amazong adviser sound difficult to live up to), but it needs to work for both of you.

Secondly, sometimes people just don't work well together, call it personality/style clash whatever, doesn't have to be someone's fault. In my experience, it's just as valuable to find out who you really don't want to work with, as is with the inverse. 

So, you shouldn't ignore your feelings. If there is any scope to move to a different lab, definitely explore it seriously before deciding whether to stay or not. Also, talk to other people in the lab if you feel comfortable, see if you're the only one having issues with this particular person. Is there someone in the faculty you can speak to about these peoblems confidentially? Might be worth doing. 

If you move labs, you can simply say that the other lab's work interest you more, and not go into the real reason. The good news is that if she is a first year PhD, she probably doesn't have enough influence in other labs to affect you negatively.

Anecdotally, I struggle with similar mental health issues, though they come in waves of intensity and are certainly worse some weeks than others. I work full-time in an administrative role at my university, and having just finished my first (and likely most intensive) semester of my Master's degree, I found both positives and negatives in pursuing a graduate education while concurrently working 40 hours per week. I find that my depressive episodes are worse when I don't have rigid deadlines and responsibilities to keep me busy, and I often found myself too busy to get in my own head too much about that stuff. On the flipside, I was definitely overwhelmed at a couple of points last semester when I allowed myself to fall a little behind on coursework. That in itself does not help reinforce a positive image of oneself. As one could expect, my social life also suffered, and I found myself missing out on gatherings with friends that I would have otherwise been a part of.

At my school, and throughout the state's university system, we can only be reimbursed for 3 credits per semester, it has to be related to your professional role in the university (either directly relevant to your position or something that will lead to progression within the field), and your department has to pay for it. This is a great deal for someone in that situation and willing to attend part-time, but unfortunately I am pursing my graduate degree in a field unrelated to the one I'm currently working in (full-time) and my department is underfunded as is.

The main thing is making it a priority to stay on top of your mental health and self care. You didn't mention if you're on meds or how often you attend therapy. If you aren't on an antidepressant, but plan to try medication, you probably want to get that in order first since it can take a few weeks for meds to be effective and most SSRIs will actually make you a little worse for a couple weeks before you get better. If you're already on something, talk to your clinician about more frequent medication monitoring around the time you transition to grad school so you can tweak your dosage, if needed. If you aren't seeing someone for regular talk therapy already, you should add that to your treatment plan. As someone else mentioned, most universities have free counseling services for students but you may not be able to get appointments as frequently as you need. That being said, try to find a therapist who can set you up for weekly appointments at the same day/time each week (same day/time will help you keep it a priority when your coursework or lab work gets busy). If you've been diagnosed with major depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar, ADD/ADHD, PTSD, schizophrenia, learning disability, etc... contact the University disability support office and find out what you need to do to file for education accommodations. You may just want to fill out a form to report your ""disability"" (the diagnosis counts even if you aren't technically classified as ""legally disabled"") without requesting any accommodations, but having it on file will help if you need to request accommodations later. In the USA, the Americans with Disabilities Act protects your right to recieve reasonable accommodations for mental health conditions. Some things you can request (although it's not guaranteed that they will give everything you request) are extended test-taking time, flexible scheduling, options to work from home, extra free counseling (if there's a limit on number of visits/student), tutoring services, alternate assignments or extended deadlines for certain types of assignment, or those type of things. Accommodations won't help much for your lab responsibilities, but if you have required classes to take, they can really help prevent you from getting overwhelmed and take a little pressure off. I believe there are similar disability protections that apply in the UK, but not sure how that would work. If you're in the USA and have more questions about how it works at a public university, I'm happy to share what I know.",1,2020-01-16 04:14:21,AskAcademia

I just want to say that I’m currently in a PhD program and my mental health situation is a lot like yours. It HAS been hard. I started many moons ago and I ultimately stepped away because it had become too much. I’ve gotten help and I’ve learned some ways of taking care of myself...but this will probably always play some role in my life. 

I’m back now. It’s still hard...but I’m doing it and I’m glad I’m doing it. I guess I just want you to know that there are people in the same sort of situation as you. It can be done, but it can be messy.

I don’t know your situation, so maybe I’m off base...but a lot of the comments on this thread sort of take the position of, “if you’re not in a good place, don’t do it”.

Sometimes I wish they had, sometimes not, but generally think it's fine to let people know what you are comfortable knowing in a general sense. Here I think it's okay to say something like ""I need to take some time off to deal with mental health issues"". 

What is harder as a 'boss' is dealing with people who don't have clear boundaries about information or expect (even inadvertently) for me to play a role of therapist or provider-of-validation. Those are not really my job (i can validate when they do well, or encourage them to keep at it, but it's not always easy to mix discussion about science or academics with health). I would definitely not be trained to be a therapist, and it's nice if you can keep those different mentoring roles in slightly separate categories. 

I also think, in your case, that a 60h week is too much. Can I guess that you aren't being paid much, or paid overtime costs? That's just far too much for a student worker to be doing. Again, be clear with what you can and want to commit, and then try to do that. Re-evaluate as necessary.

One off workshops, full certifications, mentorships, etc.  I found them really helpful AND they look amazing on a CV because being a good teacher means being a good communicator and that is a very transferable skilll.

- My university also has career resources for post docs and grad students. I really recommend you check yours out if you have access to it. Tonnes of seminars on how to transition from academia to industry, people to help you write a resume and practice for job interviews, skills inventories to help you figure out what fields may work for you etc.

This would allow you to handle the consequences and what comes next properly - remember that other people might also need some time to calm down and process this situation rationally (like you had to experience), so it's understandable that they've reacted strongly to the news. Besides immediate actions that need to be taken (e.g., withdrawing the paper), I think you should continue communicating with your advisor and be open to discuss next steps to move forward.

On the note about taking care of your mental health, try taking a step back and consider how this single event might not be reflective of your life as a whole. You are a human being with multiple values and purposes - your life is meaningful. Think of the reasons why you are living besides academics (e.g., your family and what they would want for you, your important values and how what you are doing right now upholds them).

Getting a B isn't the end of the world.  I would recommend going to the schools consoling offices to talk with someone (I mean the mental health ones and not the ones that help schedule classes).  I had a similar situation where I did very well in high school and wanted to maintain it in college.  But had a class that kicked my butt and got a C.  I tried my best but it just never clicked in time.  But I knew my GPA wouldn't fall below the 3.5 I needed for my scholarship and unless I went for further schooling, no one looks at GPA.  And it's normal for something to not necessarily clicked very easily and not get an A.  If you are thinking of doing more schooling, take a look at the average GPA for those programs.  And make that your benchmark for your GPA.  As long as it's higher than that average or close, you'll be fine.  Not having a 4.0 doesn't make you any less of a person or get you anything special in the end.  Other than extra stress thinking you have to maintain it.

Like people who want to be mental health professionals but need practical experience but have been trained already.  By going to them, it helps them get experience.  

I know from personal experience how going from high school to college is crazy.  And the focus in GPA and grads in highschool can be way to focused.  The idea that grades and GPA will determine everything is a hard idea to break.  But the joke that what do you call the guy who got the lowest grades in med school? Doctor. Is more true than you might think.  In the end, you get the same degree if you have a 4.0 or 2.0.  it took me awhile to actually accept this.  But I still get anxiety over the same stuff of not meeting some very difficult or impossible goals that mean nothing if I get them.  But the tricks I learned from my group therapy sessions in college have helped me so much.  Not only realizing why I got stressed out over a A or B or just missing class.  It's totally normal to freak out about a B even if silly.  But even talking to someone for one session can make you realize so much and maybe even get to why you are stressed out over something that is so small.  I know I'm saying the same thing over and over but I've been in a similar spot and seen others there as well.

- held one on one meetings often (if only so they could actually keep on top of what people are working on)
- provided constructive and positive feedback more frequently, even for the little milestones

But for me, fun wasn't enough. The work didn't feel useful, helpful, or fulfilling, regardless of how intellectually stimulating it was (I did physics). So I left and pursued more meaningful things (now I'm pursuing cognitive and mental health sciences).

I completely understand feeling this way. It’s incredibly normal and not at all surprising. The world is not so black and white though: good people do bad things. Maybe she was having a bad day and venting and didn’t realize that it was public. Maybe she and you had some kind of cascading failure of miscommunication that sparked it. Maybe she wrote it as a joke or troll post. There are a lot of explanations that *aren’t* “she’s evil.” 

&gt; If it wasn't written in duress, and she didn't write it because she's awful and wants to ruin my career, the only thing left is that she wrote it because she genuinely believes it. Which means I must have done something to incite it, and if I believe that then I have to worry that other people secretly hate me for the same thing.

This is not true. Even if we assume she wrote it because she genuinely believes it that **doesn’t necessarily mean** you did something wrong. Misinterpretations of your actions are typically *her fault* and not yours. You are certainly not blameworthy for her writing it.

Additionally, I don’t think that your trichotomy at the beginning is true though I’m not interested in litigating it. **The bottom line is that you are not to blame and you should not assume others think poorly of you**. This is really hard to do, but it’s really important. It’s totally reasonable for you to feel stressed, scared, or worried. It’s difficult, but learning to move on from inexplicably bad social interactions and not letting your social anxiety ruin interactions with others is an extremely important skill to build. Everyone experiences things like this, and you will experience it again in the future. Learning to let it go is one of the best things you can do.

fi15g5e,Ut_Prosim,t2_coju6,"Pro-PhD: 

* Medical school costs an insane amount, you'll probably be $200k in debt by the end of it, a PhD program should pay you. If you fail out of a PhD halfway through you leave with an MS, if you fail out of MD halfway through you leave with $100,000+ of debt. 

* PhD is probably more capable quantitatively, better acclimated to the research environment, grant writing, publishing, data analytics, etc. (even versus an MD-PhD who probably focused the former).  

* MD is probably more stressful and more work. Don't get me wrong, a PhD is hard enough to cause all sorts of mental problems. I don't know anyone who got through my program without some physical health problems brought on by stress. But med school is even worse. My best friend went through it while I did my PhD, and I'm confident I wouldn't have made it. I pulled a few emergency writing sessions in grad school where I just slept in the lab and wrote, but med school seemed like that 24x7. Residency seemed even worse. They changed the law while my friend was going through it to limit the on-clock hours to 80 per week, as expected hospitals simply ordered them to lie. They'd work a normal day, clock out, then keep working usually 100-110 per week. I pulled a few weeks like that in my dissertation writing time, but it was never consistent week in week out.
___________
Pro-MD:

* If you're doing medical research in an academic hospital or med school, the MD will always be top dog, the PhD will always be seen as ancillary assistant. 

* MD will probably pay a lot more. 

* MD is far more flexible. There are probably a dozen total tenure-track spots in the USA that fit your exact PhD research and each one will get 150 applications. MD has the option of going into practice (with residency), and once they're done, they can go anywhere. Throw a dart at CONUS, is there a research university nearby? Probably not. Do they have a department that does what you do, and are they hiring? Almost certainly not. Is there a hospital nearby that needs doctors, all but guaranteed. If your spouse wants to move to RandomTown, USA, you're 100x more likely to find work as an MD than PhD.

* MD is four years, you finish or you fail. PhD can take twice as long if you're not focused or run into setbacks. 
__________
Neutral:

* MD vs PhD are a completely different experiences. The MD is incredibly structured, rigorous, memorization heavy. The PhD requires much self-reliance as you literally chart your own course. This independance is great for some, and terrible for others who'd rather just have an ordered schedule.",1,2020-02-18 18:36:46,AskAcademia
fi506ka,HiiragiFujiwara,t2_29pyahzk,"Grad school is quite different than undergrad.  The expectations are different, it is more research oriented, and you work more closely with your adviser.  When applying to grad school you are expected to be somewhat more specific in outlining what you want to do in the future and your research interests should align with your adviser's.  

In the humanities for an MA you are likely going to have to write some kind of thesis which requires original research.  Also classes tend to be more discussion based and require a lot of reading.  The professors tend to be more interested in hearing your original ideas than if you can regurgitate the  author's argument.  

I would say the thing I struggled with the most were maintaining my mental health, burnout, and the higher expectations professors have for you.

I would say museum/curatorial studies programs at the MA level are competitive but perhaps less so than PhD programs.  The biggest issue with MA programs is the lack of funding (this might be especially true if you're looking internationally) and the oversaturation in the market.  Still, if you are interested in entering the museum field, an MA in Museum Studies/Curatorial Studies will help you be more competitive when applying to jobs.",1,2020-02-19 22:40:58,AskAcademia

fi5kvgo,ApesInSpace,t2_6lq7x,"A couple things:

1. First and foremost, don't sacrifice your mental health towards the degree. Don't ""bite the bullet,"" don't ""power through."" Yes, the first year of every single PhD program is brutal for everyone, and anyone who tells you otherwise is lying. As someone who never experienced severe anxiety before my own graduate program, I can say it absolutely produces that effect, even in people without a predisposition to it. But that kind of ""we're all fucked"" boot camp logic can actually **stop** people from seeking mental health counseling when they need it (after all, everyone in your cohort is stressed) and at the worst, it keeps people from making the right decisions for them. Don't hesitate to reach out to resources (sounds like you are, and that's awesome). And don't hesitate to leave if you realize that the grueling realities of graduate school aren't compatible with you being healthy or happy. 

2. What do you *want* to do? I stuck with my program because despite how fucking awful &amp; hard &amp; anxiety-inducing it was, I absolutely loved the project I was working on, and I loved the field I was in. Without those cornerstones - the steady knowledge that I loved this field, and I loved what I was doing - I never, ever would have continued through the shit. So I guess the best question might be: what kind of a project would be so cool, so fascinating to you, that it would be worth the difficulty of studying it for half a decade in painstaking detail? It's okay to not know yet (hell, I didn't find my dream project until year 3). But try to parse out a few different things... is it *this project* you hate? Is it *this field* you hate? Is it *academic work in general* you hate? 

(FWIW, saying yes to any or all of these is 100% okay and has zero bearing on your intelligence or ambition... but it's better to figure out which of these are the problem, early on in your program. I have friends who didn't figure out they hated academic research in general until their 3rd year. So good on you for identifying a major problem in your first year, and for considering possible routes if you decide to leave, like a Masters).",1,2020-02-20 02:21:32,AskAcademia

fi5xvg3,mirabelle7,t2_2nm4cnv,"I agree with taking time off. I took two medical leaves during my PhD program. The first was during my 2nd semester due to a concussion. The second was a shorter leave of like 8 weeks for mental health reasons after my 4th year. I went back after my 2nd leave and finished within the year - even ahead of everyone else in my cohort despite my leaves. It was an awful time getting through the program. I’m still on the market and some days I’m not sure getting a PhD was worth it, but other days the skills I learned (really just about how to do pure research and think critically) have come in very handy just in every day life. Also - I met some of my now very best friends in my program. 

With all that being said, when I was in my 20s - work, research, and school were my life. Now, I prioritize relationships and relaxing more. I’m not even seeking tenure-track jobs because of this shift. So, it’s ok if you need some time off or if your life goals/priorities have changed (if you leave tho, I’d definitely do the leave of absence - just in case).

When I started my post doc, I also moved countries, alone, away from friends and family and I really struggled, ending up crying on my way to work everyday and contemplating suicide. What helped me was reaching out to the medical services available at the campus and actively working to improve my mental health. I bargained with myself that if, after 6 months of antidepressants, weekly therapy, focusing on my mental health and taking it a little easier on myself and in the lab, I was still in the same mental place that it would mean the situation was bad and not just my mental state, and if so, then I could leave knowing that it was the right decision. In the end, 2 years later I’m still here and while I have my ups and downs I’m glad I gave myself that chance to heal. But that is my story, your ending may involve moving back home to be happy.

I don't think you necessarily need to give all the details you gave in the post; an honest statement that you're extremely unhappy and struggling should be enough. In such a conversation it would be appropriate to express your concerns about inconveniencing them/hindering their careers.

If they don't treat you well when you speak of your mental health, then that's good information to inform your decision on whether or not to leave.

I recommend the leave of absence. You can always withdraw completely at the end of the leave if you're sure you don't want to go back. If you don't want to burn bridges, then the leave is a better choice. Even if you're sure that you don't want to go back, why not take the leave of absence, and thus keep the option open should you change your mind?  You might think differently at the end of six months. I took a year off from my PhD with no intention of returning, but at the end of the year, I went back.

* Create a detailed weekly schedule, including exercise, and stick to it. Forget about “I feel like doing x” and think “it’s time to do x.” I had similar issues and removing what I feel like from the equation was hard but worth it. 

* Make sure to write one or two pages per week for every class with papers. Write as you research. 

* Always start with an outline. And work on whatever part of the paper your most interested in that day. Don’t write linearly. 

* Do first what you want to do the least. Whether is reading for a class or going shopping or hitting the gym. Whatever you’re dreading, just start the day with. Once that’s done the day will be better and you’ll have shown yourself you can accomplish tasks. 

* Have a bedtime. Some professors will tell you that during grad school they spent days without sleeping. Ignore them. Health first. Also, eat well and don’t drink too much. 

* Develop a career goal (or two) and visualize the path to it. See your career as a series of stages and set up goal of what you want to achieve. 

* Avoid drama. Dramatic people will drain your time and energy. And there are a lot of them in grad school. Some with the jaded ones that have been there for 20 years. 

* Read Mad at School, and understand emotional labor. Identify what gives you energy and which activities drain it. And get a therapist like yesterday. Grad school is going to be tough on your mental health.

eyeb9qt,nuclearslurpee,t2_11caye,"Any of these are viable options depending on what approach you want to take, although the first one does sound iffy the way you put it.

1. You *can* make this work, but you need to sit down and soberly assess the effects on your mental and emotional health, short and long-term. Usually, the way people cope with a shitty job is by putting in minimum effort, putting on a fake smile when the Karens come in, and spending their other 128 hours in a week pursuing interests, a social life, and other things that make them happy. Assess how viable it is for you to live this way, at least until you can complete the work. One one hand, are the social and interest opportunities available for you, even if you have to work to find them? On the other hand, can you handle doing the minimum at work - both personally, and in terms of your long-term career plans? Honestly, with the shape of your lab as you describe it this sound iffy at best to me, but you would know better than I.

2. This is probably the best approach if you still hold out hope for an academic career. A new lab environment may help motivate you not only to put in the effort needed to really boost your CV for those faculty jobs, but also to feel like academia is a good career for you. Staying at your current lab is likely to kill that dream, honestly. If the funding is transferable, there shouldn't be a problem.

3. If you're quite sure that you would rather leave academia, this is your best option. **It is okay to turn down the grant funding.** It may not be a usual step, but circumstances do change and it's not unheard of.

eyjcmfj,Euthyphraud,t2_3j3nnf86,"I've run into this with other professors, and admittedly a few times with own students. To be honest, if you have this issues as you do then you ought to stop and consider how your 'calm terms' are received. I know professors who can be very calm, and come off unbelievably rude - they aren't mutually exclusive. 

I have noticed a shift in recent years; this new generation, now with the first students born after 9/11, is very different. Studies indicate, and my own experience supports, that students now are far more emotionally attuned - there is an expectation of empathy and understanding. There is a universal need to be accepted as individuals - not hard to understand why given the social media the world has provided them. It's the first generation that began school after Columbine, who are more familiar with 'active shooter drills' than tornado drills or fire drills.

It is a generation, among which include your youngest batches of *newly minted PhDs -* who are far more affected by mental health problems such as severe anxiety, panic attacks, PTSD. They are more insecure, more affected by media and less certain of who to believe or trust. You need them to trust you. 

It sounds more to me - and this is, again, internet advice so no ill will is meant here - that you are the one becoming less in tune with the times. The younger generations always supplant the old, and there are many new professors younger than I who are even more focused on empathy, inclusivity, diversity training and more - and that means talking about 'feelings'. It used to be professors were an unknown, without opinions - today all our opinions are a google search away. You have to - or are now expected to - be more open about yourself and more willing to hear students out and talk to them about things that weren't always expected of professors. When I began teaching over a decade ago it was still expected that you were to never have discussions about personal issues - today, you won't be viewed by student's as a good professor (or by people such as myself...) if you don't. I personally have had two students I've helped intervene on because of suicidal tendencies - and who ended up thanking me enough to allay any fear I had that I had overly intruded - with one contacting me later saying I was the only professor who cared and that I personally saved their life by intervening. 

That's the role we have in a classroom of very young adults-in-training. Remember, some of your students are going to be as young as 16 or 17! Their lives are more complicated than ours at that age - the world isn't the same. Being a professor is being an educator; being an educator means educating a person - making them better, more aware, think more critically - and they can't do it if brushed aside.

If you have somewhere to be, kindly tell the student you really wish you could talk now but you *have* to go - and to *please* email you and also consider coming by office hours (or - you know - another issue here, students don't come to office hours as much as they used to - but if you make yourself somewhat more available via an online 'facetime' thing-like app (I still don't understand technology!) many more will.

It's the professor's duty to keep up with the times - not just in terms of the literature, but in terms of the culture of those they charged with educating. And to adapt to that, and be there as mentors and educators - not as researchers who also have to teach and weren't given enough TAs.",1,2019-08-29 22:11:28,AskAcademia

eyliaed,Euthyphraud,t2_3j3nnf86,"Your students will be more diverse in terms of the degree to which they care about the course, how serious they take it, how much they read, and the knowledge they bring with them aside from the material. You'll have freshmen from school districts that were awful and who may be bright, but know far less than you might expect. You'll have seniors who are obsessed with the topic and way ahead of the material. You have to provide definitions, explain things clearly - *and incorporate examples, humorous anecdotes, etc. -* it isn't as easy to hold undergrad's attention, especially in prereq courses that draw lots of non-majors. 

Also, things have changed considerably - it used to be that professors were very aloof, not providing personal opinions (matters more in social sciences/humanities). Today, your views are a google search away. Honesty goes a long way - you can be open, but be clear that you don't let biases interfere with grading and ask students to talk to you if they feel you aren't being fair. The more you make yourself accessible, human and reasonable in how you treat them the better - students very much want professors to see them as individuals, and may want to share things (and need to - there are now more legal obligations to report and help with mental health issues and to work with disability centers than 15 years ago!). You aren't there to be their friend, but be friendly. If you have a student who wants to chew up an hour of your office hours talking about topics in the field, school, careers and personal anecdotes don't discourage it (so long as it isn't keeping others from getting time). 

I suggest watching for struggling students - have an early quiz requiring them to learn a lot of basic definitions and ideas on their own and send emails to those who get C's or less. Email a student who fails to meet an important essay deadline, but has been doing well - *and be willing to accept late assignments.* 

I actually lie on my syllabi - I don't keep students to deadlines or deduct from them for being a bit late nearly as much as I threaten. This discourages those who may just want to do it to procrastinate, but allows those who have real life problems get a chance to still do well. 

I've had students just give up because they miss an important deadline due to some tragic event in their life, and they don't say anything - there are students, good ones, who will fail out because a family member dies or they come down with an illness that is uncomfortable to talk about.

It actually is a fun time - you can get to know undergrads better and be yourself more. Put your own touch and be more casual - professionalism is not as well-respected or admired by students as it was 15 years ago. Students want authenticity - they know you are just human but will respect your knowledge and expertise. They have a lot going on in their lives, and you have more opportunities to connect with them and help them in ways that matter beyond just the content of your class - if you care enough to.

The biggest *negative* is the use of laptops and phones. It is virtually impossible to ban laptops anymore - I always loved getting a room in a basement that didn't have reliable wireless! You can try, but you'll get lots of people with medical reasons, or who really give sympathetic reasons to allow their use - remember these students didn't learn cursive, they learned typing. This means - Facebook, Instagram, games, etc. You have to figure out how to reign that in, and the room, class, and circumstances at your institution will do that.

Phones are the worst. Students will continually use them, even with a ban - and you have to decide how hard to crack down. I tell students if they have to text or are expecting a very important message or call, to excuse themselves when it arrives - and to sit near the door.

Students will fact check you in real time. They'll look up what you're talking about - don't embellish!

Students expect notes with the powerpoints available - often before class - you don't have to comply, but it'll impact your teaching reviews.

Students will use laptops for class, though - honestly - they do take notes, they look up things related to the topic and get more interested - and when I've tried to remember something or I tell them something that seems ludicrous and say 'look it up' - it's fun to have students immediately confirming or providing additional information!

It's a much more 'dialectical' era - you're an educator and you have more responsibilities to the students - and they will seek advice on personal issues. You'll need to decide how comfortable you are, but its okay to show interest in their lives and ask about things.

I'm currently a PhD student in social psych, and I think it would be really difficult (if not prohibited by the school completely) to do a master's program in a different field. You typically will get an en route master's with your PhD anyway, although it's obviously not counseling-based. Is there any way you can integrate mental health/counseling into your research? (For example, I know of a breadth of stigma research looking at mental health outcomes of people who receive identity-supportive counseling, and I'm sure there are multiple other research directions in that vein!)

My mom and brother are the only family I have and they both have bad mental health issues. Bothers also an alcoholic and is always in and out of jail and the hospital.

fjocgqy,TerriblePop,t2_3pdemfbo,"I have to go in the opposite direction as some of the other posters and say that I think it's a **good idea** to share this information with your advisor. A lot of what you wrote resonates with me personally. My advisor is also very ""chill,"" very laid back, and has never berated me for not turning things in on time, but it's that distance and the long leash that he keeps me on that has kept me going this entire time despite ups and downs psychologically and a close family member passing away during my time here.

It really boils down to your relationship with this faculty member. If you have a good working relationship at a baseline, a bit of self-disclosure can actually ***enhance*** a relationship and draw two people closer because vulnerability **enhances** **trust**, it doesn't divide. Which can be energizing and actually keep you from sliding into anxiety. Take the other side of the coin. You turn in work late and seem to be struggling with something, but the advisor can't tell what. So they start making assumptions without context, and those assumptions are confirmed by ""evidence"" that your advisor observes.

Think about this with your friends. You know a lot about your close friends' personal details, and vice versa. You know how many siblings they have, whether or not their parents are divorced, and what kind of food they like. Acquaintances, probably you know less, maybe only a few details. Strangers, don't know anything at all. I'm not saying your advisor has to be your best friend, but it is not a relationship like with an acquaintance.

The PhD is an even longer and more stressful road than the MS (which is stressful enough). If you work with this advisor for your PhD, wouldn't you rather figure out if they're an ass early on when you only have a brief time to complete your Master's thesis, rather than be halfway through your PhD?

I'm not saying let all of your skeletons out of the closet or share your most intimate, darkest secrets, but giving a mentor some context - however vague - can be helpful. As I said, sharing vulnerabilities is a leap of faith that sometimes pays very rich dividends. My advisor knows that I am seeing a counselor and from time to time he will ask ""how are you feeling about everything?"" to check in. It's not much, but it is very helpful to me to know that he's got my back.

Edit: I will add that my campus has taken many measures from the top down and bottom up to raise awareness of mental health and try and shift the cultural narrative. I personally think that falling in line just because it's what everybody does is understandable, but doesn't do anything to shift the cultural narrative.

Keeping the university in the loop the whole time meant that I was never once penalized for it. We had a Disability service which I registered with, and that made it official that I had issues which needed to be accommodated for. I also had a personal tutor who was different than my thesis supervisor, and I kept him in the loop the whole time. This was crucial because due to the combined physical and mental health issues, I needed to apply for Special Circumstances every semester, and he could vouch for me because he had been following (my physical health was constantly changing so I kept him relatively updated). I also had a very chill thesis supervisor and it was important to keep him in the loop too.

It will help you in the long run if these things are on the record. However, if you're worried about stigma or getting a negative response from your supervisor, I'd recommend you go through whatever official channels your university has to register your health issue too (mental health counts!).

The criteria to get into a Ph.D. gets more competitive, and this only gets worse the higher up one goes. We know that the expectations of one's CV have changed radically in the last decade in terms of publish or perish. Even adjunctships from Ph.D.s are competitive.  

I think in this case, really mediate on what you want out of a PhD. If it is an academic job, then look at the placement rates for graduate students in your field. How many get academic jobs after their degree? What was the average number of years spent in postdocs before that? What was  the average salary when they attained a tenure-track job? Academia encourages a sense of virtuous self-sacrifice for the art, but considerations about health insurance, geographic stability, and job security are real issues. 

If the thing that you want at the end of a PhD is a government job, keep applying to government. jobs. Same for NGOs. Yes, a Ph.D. might get you paid more at a government job later, but discounting the opportunity cost of 4-10 years in not moving up in one's position as a government worker (or other field for that matter) is bad math. 

Adjuncting is one way to get  sense of your love of the teaching vs. research skills, but the most important thing about such an experiment might be: how little money  am I willing to live off of with no benefits?  This is what happens to an increasing percentage of humanities and social sciences Ph.D.s after graduation. Similarly, if you do any of the working abroad experience, this advice might better serve you if you think of it as both a chance to make you more competitive to get into grad school, but also for other careers paths. 

Also, before I write a letter of reference for anyone wanting to go to grad school I ask them to consult a few articles on mental illness (especially depression and anxiety) as a grad-school work related hazard.

As for work management, what is most important is that you find a way to keep yourself organized and stick with it.

When you start reading and downloading journal articles, set up a reference manager like Zotero or Mendeley.

Both Zotero and Mendeley have Microsoft Word plugins that can make importing and organizing references very easy.

&gt;Don't take it personally.

My job is to get X, Y, and Z projects done by this date, and now project A has also been added to my plate.  This may be what your PI was feeling, and they lashed out in an attempt to keep you until May because it makes life easier for them.  HOWEVER, what is good for you and your life and your physical/mental health and well being is far more important than what makes life easier for them. 

You know your PI better than us, so take this in light of your experiences, if your PI sees your relationship as not just employer/employee but also mentor/mentee, then add to the conversation why this industry job is good for your life/career goals/health, etc. This could ease some of the sting of ""I'm leaving the group and academia as a whole.""

eyz01oh,sleepspice,t2_4ina37aj,"Thank you for this perspective. I do try and understand from my supervisors view but at times it can be hard. 

In response to your suggests I had already made an 'action plan' with my supervisor upon returning from my break in April and met all the goals set out. I tried to show I was working as hard as I could and any delay I would give and explanation for ( with at times alternative solutions as well to address the situation).  I do not have a paper submitted and the main focus was to get this first year report completed, and submitted, which I have worked hard to do.

When realising we weren't on the same page I spoke to my co-supervisor to get an unbiased opinion and try and make amends rather than casting my supervisor as a villain. After this meeting I wrote a long and clear email showing I understand where my weaknesses are and clarified any misconceptions/misunderstanding and even gave a new action plan and made it clear where my priorities were and what I planned on doing next. 

This is why I can't understand why things haven't improved and I feel my environment is getting steadily more toxic.

- while I'm really glad to hear that a lab environment soothes and makes you happy, there will inevitably be a point in grad school where it will become a trigger. If you can pinpoint what it is exactly about research that makes you happy (preferably excluding the ""i'm making a difference"" part), it will serve you very very well. 




- clinical trial manager: yep, even if you do get to a manager position through just a bachelors, you'll face roadblocks after that if you don't have a PhD. Not hugely problematic barriers, but from the people I've talked to, it just really really helps to have a PhD. 



- a PhD in itself isn't going to bring you down mentally, it just tests you with a lot of hurdles, and self-esteem, self-worth, pride, and all of that, just get challenged in a relatively short span of time. I don't doubt that people in other professions and other fields and other walks of life go through the same existential crises (for the lack of a better term), but a PhD will face them quick and frequently. The shitty things you face in a PhD, you'll face analogous things outside too imo.

fdklj14,so_i_happened,t2_90rhb,"I am coming at this comment from the opposite direction. I’m in my mid-30s and in my first year of a public policy phd program. I’ve spent the last decade working in public policy nonprofits, and the last six years in a senior management role at one of those nonprofits. My job became increasingly stressful. It was 9-5 and I had the luxury of working remotely sometimes but, still, was generally expected to be “on the clock” from 9 to 5 (and of course had many days and weeks of longer hours). 

I started this phd with the assumption that I do NOT want a career in academia after I earn the phd but now I’m questioning that, and a big part of the reason why has to do with the schedule flexibility that faculty have. They do tons of work, but it isn’t on a rigid 9 to 5 schedule. Every job has its stressors, but I have a new appreciation for how much a flexible schedule can contribute to my mental health and wellbeing, even if just for accommodating the unexpected problems that come up in life.

My main point is that it’s all relative. Every job has awful parts and great parts and it takes time to figure out which of those matter most to you, and which type of job will give you the best balance. Also, that can and probably will change over time! When I finished my masters degree 10 years ago, transitioning to a 9 to 5 schedule felt like freedom.

One substitute lecture became 2 became 6 became me teaching 1/3 of the course before any other faculty member found out and intervened. I never thought to tell anyone and was in such a poor mental state that I blamed myself for my inability to be a primary lecturer for a course I had TA'd once before. I was taking my own classes during this time and had to withdraw from 2 courses mid-semester, 1 course another semester, got a C in a course (as you know, grad school ""fail"") and was placed on academic probation. I was not productive with research. I had sought counseling and psychiatric help the entire time and experienced recovery with symptoms getting worse. Finally, at a routine physical (and months after first working with a psychiatrist) I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Now, if I take my thyroid-meds I am perfectly fine, but it took months to recover and realize how much time I lost.

I considered taking the complaint  further, but I didn't want the hassle; I just wanted to get the degree  and gtfo. Which I now have done.

Gah, your experience was so full of red flags!  It sounds like you ran into a perfect storm of a terrible mentor and an unaccommodating program.  And, I agree that there is a huge onus on the student to complain and then endure the fallout.  I guess that's one of the things that we should try and change.  No easy solutions there, though.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;PIs, as I'm sure you're aware, are there primarily for their skills as a  scientist, not for their man-management (which can often be quite  dismal). This is a big difference between gown and town, as  man-management is a huge consideration when hiring for senior positions  in a non-academic institutions. I can't think of a good solution that  doesn't add to the already horrific administrative bloat in most  universities.

This gets at something else I was trying to make clear: most managers in companies also started out as individual contributors and then rose to management ranks.  Sometimes they get MBAs or other formal training, and sometimes not.  In my department there is active mentorship of junior faculty and lots of looking over the shoulder as they guide their first set of students.  I think this helps give new faculty at least some tools that help them and their students succeed.  Not to say it's perfect, but it's worlds apart from your experience.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Y'see, this is part of my issue. I  don't want to put words in your mouth so I won't accuse you of saying  this, but the reaction I get from some people in academia when I tell  the about my issues with the field is something along the lines of  (""well, if you were just looking to advance your career, this isn't the  place for you""). Or, even worse, that I wasn't cut out for it because I  lacked resilience or perspective.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ofc I want to advance my career, but I genuinely *do*  love science, and I do want to be a part of something that advances the  wealth of our scientific knowledge, and maybe one days benefits  society. I understand that certain sacrifices must be made for that. But  I also don't want to be treated like shit for 3-6yrs for a  poverty-level stipend. I really didn't think that was too much to ask.

Based on our brief interaction, it seems clear to me that you have resilience and perspective.  And, I'll own that I was reflecting on my personal experience as a mentor more than what you'd specifically written.  Nobody should be treated like shit - end of story.  It's super sad that you were.  I guess just know that there are many places that are not like what you described (and some that are, unfortunately).  Our main disagreements are 1) I see most of academia as somewhere between benign and positive and 2) I see other professional realms as equally burdened by people being assholes.

A few points of advice:

* You need to be in treatment for your mental health issues. This is really scary to accept at first (I resisted treatment for years out of fear of meds), but therapy + medication can really help. Your school may have a student counseling center where you can receive cheap or free mental health care. 
* Learn to be early to things. I could be off base, but I've seen several people with similar mental health problems to yours and they all found it impossible to be on time (myself included). I fixed this problem by aiming to be half an hour to an hour early to anything. Yes, it's a pain in the butt, but it really helps a lot. Consistently being on time is one of the best ways to demonstrate responsibility. If you need to cancel an appointment, do it as early as you possibly can. 
* As another poster said, keep your goals small and manageable. Break down your big goals into bite sized ones. ""Prove meaning of life"" is an impossibly big goal, but ""write small functionality of code"" is manageable. 
* Write down EVERYTHING. Your brain is not your friend. I keep a notebook for research that I write in (basically a stream of consciousness) all day while I work, plus an experiment log. Depression can make your memory foggy, so having a record of exactly what you did is invaluable.",1,2019-09-17 13:11:13,AskAcademia

&gt; OK, I'll bite 

Oh this wasn't intended as bait or a concern troll! I was genuinely interested in what PIs would have to say.  


Anyway, before we proceed, I should probably disclose what the main issue was. Due to my disability (affects manual dexterity and short-term memory), I struggled a lot with memorising and carrying out lab protocols and screwed up a fair bit. My supervisor assumed this was due to some mixture of laziness, cynicism and incompetence, so prevented me from doing a lot of things that I needed for my thesis so that I didn't waste lab resources. After I brought it up with the course coordinators &amp; disability office (who were sympathetic but kinda useless lol), I was begrudgingly allowed. But this resulted in me getting quite publicly berated whenever I got things wrong. 

It didn't help that the lab was poorly funded (despite being quite prestigious??) and a pretty unpleasant environment in general. Very passive aggressive and a *lot* of bitching; didn't walk in on anything being said about myself, but I can only assume. I remember on one of my first days I walked in on a heated meeting about a plagiarism accusation. Everyone seemed miserable and at each other's throats. I've worked in a bunch of different places, and this was hands down the worst working environment I've ever encountered. And is, unfortunately corroborated by a lot of people I've spoken to in academia.

The whole thing wore me down quite a lot and really fucked with my mental health. I've never had anxiety before, but I was having almost daily panic attacks in the lab. I considered taking the complaint further, but I didn't want the hassle; I just wanted to get the degree and gtfo. Which I now have done.

 

&gt;There are definitely asshole PIs, just like in any other industry. And, they do make life hell for students. In my field, they are widely known and students are actively steered away from their labs. The occasional moth does get drawn to the flame, despite warnings, though. I think we, as a community could do much better in upholding higher standards for PIs through both formal and informal processes. 

This is good to know that other PIs are aware of it. But this lack of accountability speaks to the institutional problems in academia. I didn't pursue a formal complaint because I needed my PI's help to complete my thesis and for a reference, and I didn't want to get myself buried in some bureaucratic ""he-said, she-said"" shitshow that dragged out for months.

PIs, as I'm sure you're aware, are there primarily for their skills as a scientist, not for their man-management (which can often be quite dismal). This is a big difference between gown and town, as man-management is a huge consideration when hiring for senior positions in a non-academic institutions. I can't think of a good solution that doesn't add to the already horrific administrative bloat in most universities. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;With that said, students themselves bring all sorts of baggage, which PIs are only partly empowered to help resolve. For example, many students have a terrible time because they have unrealistic expectations or a bad attitude. Here I think that we should be doing a better job of teaching students professionalism and also showing them the door if things aren't working out. 

Yeah, grad students aren't perfect, and bring their own problems. I agree with your assessment; this shows one of the many ways in which academia suffers from not being approached as a normal working environment. Were this a company, employees who for whatever reason are struggling would be given appropriate feedback, and yes, shown the door if it's not a good fit. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Finally, the system sometimes causes problems for PIs and students alike. Mainly, systematic issues revolve around funding or visas, either of which can be problematic in ways that cause students to suffer. I am not sure what solutions could be implemented for these issues, other than to more fully fund research.

Generally agreed. You can't solve every issue by throwing money at it. But research could certainly benefit from a little bit of that haha

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; If you are min/maxing your career, graduate school in basic science is not the way to go. For example, private sector finance or computer science yield more financial reward per unit effort.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;As you move to the private sector, I would strongly encourage you to think hard about why your graduate experience was so bad. Many of the same conditions that make graduate school hard (high expectations, power dynamics, externally imposed challenges) can be just as bad or worse in industry. Developing the skills to weather these difficulties in a positive way can be really empowering.

Y'see, this is part of my issue. I don't want to put words in your mouth so I won't directly accuse you of saying this, but the reaction I get from some people in academia when I tell the about my issues with the field is something along the lines of (""well, if you were just looking to advance your career, this isn't the place for you"").

I’d recommend therapy and consulting your institution’s mental health resources first and foremost. 

Speaking from my own experience, for you to change your own work habits I’d recommend toning down or taking a break from the cycle. It’s easy to feel like you’re wasting time and have to be constantly working, but all the successful researchers I’ve talked to agree that constantly working is ineffective and a work life balance and good habits are crucial to being a good and creative academic. 

It’s ok to take a break: instead of a depressive state where you’re stressed and feel like you need to be working, plan to take a vacation so you can actually de stress (if that’s possible). Or when you’re working, try to impose a more limited schedule on your work time and you may find that you’ll have the willfulness to work for a longer number of weeks. Just try to make small changes during each part of your work cycle until your workflow changes from an oscillation into a flat line.",1,2019-09-06 20:11:14,AskAcademia

Is the task to go *convince them to come to class* or is the task to *find out if they are okay*? It sounds like the latter to me. 

Unlike some of the other commenters, I do not think that latter task is clearly unethical. Schools organize themselves in different ways. And it would, in my opinion, likely be unethical for *no one* to reach out to a student struggling in this way. It's *someone's* job and academic advising is not necessarily a ridiculous candidate.  

However, even if it is something that could reasonably be in your job description, you, personally, might still be a bad fit for this task. You say you are not a ""people person"" and you clearly feel super uncomfortable. I would literally just say that: This student is clearly struggling and needs some form of support. However, that support may be mental health related or otherwise sensitive in nature and you have no training in this area.

Also, this is more of an issue of maintaining professional boundaries than privacy.  It would be okay for a friend or neighbor/R.A. to knock on the door. However, the student wouldn't be expecting such a visit from his adviser. Suppose he wasn't fully dressed when he answered the door thinking it was a student--only to find his adviser at his door? No matter what the situation, it would be awkward at best. Maybe he just experienced a break-up or personal setback and doesn't want to be seen in such as distressed state or in the throes of mental illness. How much more embarrassing would it be to have his adviser show up at his door?

Alternatively,if he doesn't answer the door, how far should they go to get in touch with him? Since you said he doesn't have a right to privacy, should they be able to enter without his permission?

Careful here. Just carrying in credit can count toward electives when you transfer, and as a freshman, you’re likely taking gen eds that will transfer. It’s unlikely at a four-year college that you’re taking courses that are “in the major”. 

Also, if you drop them after the drop/add period, you could get failing grades and transfer your 0.0 GPA with you to your new school.

1. Your GPA
2. Your financial aid / debt 
3. Your ability to re-enroll in the future

You need to recognize that despite all the hoo-ha a postdoc is still just a job. We're told its not just a job, that everything you do in it benefits your future and so working longer and harder is just for your own benefit. In real terms however, that's bullshit, its a job that we are contracted to work 40 hrs per week and are paid relatively poorly at that. Your boss can have unrealistic expectations, but in the end you only legally owe them 40 hrs per week. 

It sounds like you've already know that this can't continue on as it is. It sounds like your priorities lie elsewhere and thats perfectly fine. Live the life you want, not to someone else's expectations. It doesn't matter if your PI is disappointed in you. Aren't you disappointed in them for being a bad mentor? When did their expectations of you, start to matter more than your own expectations for yourself? I went through the same thing and recognized my priorities were focussed on a healthy balance and that continuing in academia wasn't for me. It sounds like this might be similar to how you're feeling currently. At that point I realized my PI had less of a hold over me, if I wasn't continuing in academia I needed their approval less - at worst they might give me a bad reference to industry but I could also choose not to use them as a reference. Revel in this revelation - your PIs expectations of you have nowhere as much hold over you. In industry only your skillset matters and its not like your PI can erase your skillset.  

Once I realized this, the question became why am I still doing this? Why haven't I left already? What purpose does my post-doc serve if I don't plan to continue on in academia? Does that purpose equate to a difference of 60K a year in salary? The answer for me was that I needed a paper as a sweetener for companies to hire me given the extra hurdle of them needing to support my work visa. So based on that I came up with an exit plan. Mine became publishing a paper and getting out ASAP. My goal became doing what was needed to get that paper, but also accepting I wasn't going to kill myself for it. I largely stopped working weekends and 12 hr days. It required a re-framing of my approach, I worked my ass off for those 40 hrs I was contracted to work, but I didn't feel I owed my boss more than that. If I worked overtime it was to serve my goal of getting my paper out ASAP, not to serve my PI. It was to benefit me, not someone else. As a result I felt I had more control over my life and my mood lightened. 

Develop an exit plan. Can you leave straight away or do you want to publish.

gf6qzg3,HumanDrinkingTea,t2_o4xhq,"It's really tragic. It's starts much earlier than you'd think, and in my experience, the brighter the student, the worse it is. 

I used to teach one-on-one piano lessons, and one particular student of mine comes to mind. She was in the 3rd grade and obviously very gifted. The sort of student who had clearly always been the top student in her class and had never had to work to understand anything she'd been taught in school. I remember many instances where I taught her a concept that was years above grade level for her, and she picked up on it without a problem.

One-on-one lessons, in general, are particularly valuable for students who are either very strong or very weak relative to their peers, because it's sometimes the only experience they have where their education is tailored specifically towards their ability level. I teach at whatever level is appropriate for any given individual, because (obviously) this optimizes learning outcomes. 

For this girl, it meant being challenged for the first time in her life. I am pretty sure that my piano lessons were the first time where she was asked to learn at a level appropriate for her ability. This meant that she *didn't* ""get"" everything the first time through. I love this girl to death, but she would be in tears every single lesson. It's hard not to feel like an awful person when you're constantly triggering an emotional meltdown in someone, but she was in tears because making a mistake or getting something wrong clearly challenged her entire sense of self. 

Fortunately, as an 8 year old, she had both me and her mom by her side to give her the encouragement she needed to be able to learn how to handle failure. She would learn to breathe and repeat to herself ""mistakes are okay"" but it's hard for a kid like her to get through it.

Failure takes practice. And whenever I taught this student and was tempted to lower my standards for her so she'd stop crying and feel less pain, I'd think about those Ivy League kids jumping off bridges.  These kids need to learn how to handle failure when they have a support system around them. I imagine her at 18 years old, alone and with no one to help her through those emotions. 

Every one of these kids has been surrounded by nothing but praise for their performance since practically the day they were born. Most people aren't mindful of how our k-12 system and how society in general perpetuates ""smart"" as an identity, rather than something you work towards and are constantly getting better at. 

I have another story of a 4(!) year old who said to me ""I'm no good at anything."" He was about 2 years ahead of his peer group, but his brother who was a year older (who I also taught) was also about 2 years ahead of his peer group, and the younger child was always comparing himself to his brother and was convinced he wasn't ""good enough.""

That's the only time I've ever seen self-esteem issues in a kid that young. Both he and his brother were absolute gems-- extremely empathic, sweet kids. The younger one was clearly the ""shadow"" child, though, and it's so painful to see children suffer like that. 

In some cases, like the 8 year old girl, it's a necessity to experience the pain in order to learn and grow (I have no idea what a person should do about the family dynamic of the 4 year old, I just added it because I'll never forget it and wanted to share). People are afraid of allowing children to experience healthy pain. They think all pain is bad. But it's all a part of the growth process.

We are losing a generation, I think, to a flawed k-12 education system. Not just on an academic level, but on a mental health level. 

I only graduated high school in 2009. I know several people who went to Ivies after graduating as valedictorian. Not a single one of them had a 4.0 (or whatever the weighted version of a 4.0 is that high schools use). At the end of my freshman year of high school I ranked #1, and I myself had a B+ on my transcript, and that was after only a single year of high school. 

Now I hear of schools that graduate *several* valedictorians, *all* with 4.0's. Meanwhile, honors students are entering college at a remedial level. Maybe this had already been going on in 2009 and I just went to a stronger school than most (I know my school was better than average, but I'm not sure to what extent). I also have heard that many schools don't rank their students any more. 

I started out high school hoping for the valedictorian spot. I think I graduated in the bottom half of my class (shit happens). But that's life. It's how I knew I'd survive when similar stuff happened in college. You fail. You cry. Then you move on and put it behind you. 

I'd hate for someone to go through what I went through (more failure than I'd like to admit). But at this point I think it's *worse* to have had nothing but A's throughout life. I very much see myself in those kids, because had I not had to deal with the life shit I had to deal with, I'd have hit failure at an older age and not had the emotional capacity to deal with it. The lesson I learned from all that failure is that I could fail every class on the face of the planet and still be the same person. I didn't believe that when I was 16, and the vast majority of r/college doesn't believe it, which is maybe why I hang out there (I try to knock some sense into them). But I believe it now. 

The ""gifted kid identity crisis"" is a serious problem that's not talked about (although there is a subreddit devoted to it-- r/aftergifted).

It could be that your professor evaluates students based on how well they learn alone because these students are easier for him, he doesn’t want to be bothered.

gf22zns,NotSomeTokenBunny,t2_59pimqgj,"I'm so sorry that this is happening to you.  It sounds like everyone is under a tremendous amount of pressure in your research group.

First of all, you need to access some kind of mental health care.  I think most people need this at some point in time in their academic journey, and yet many are reluctant.  You don't have to navigate this really challenging time on your own, and there are people out there who have all kind of tools that could help you.

I have no idea how this works in the UK, but if possible, please take some leave.  If you can't do this, establish some firm boundaries for yourself.  Schedule out your day, stick to it, and don't answer work emails after hours.  If you need to, put tasks likes grocery shopping and meal prep into your schedule and treat those tasks as just as important as your lab work.  How do you organize your work tasks?  Do you write them down or keep them all in your head?  If you're doing the latter, I highly recommend writing them down as it will be one less thing your brain is trying manage.

I would also have a frank conversation with your PI about what his demands are doing to his lab group.

ggifm4g,DevilRay-BlueJay,t2_8q208dl6,"On a more personal note, one thing people have to understand is that, for example, among new grad students (and not just women) many will have experienced sexual assault in undergrad or childhood. And if you're real lucky, (/s) you've experienced both. And often times, when those assaults occurred, they were \*not\* well received when reported, and that has very serious implications for one's education or career and mental health. So imagine that you are a grad student in that position, and while in grad school another grad student reports a professor for sending sexually explicit texts to them. The investigation happens, and the report is now public record. The department leaders, meanwhile, don't inform the grad students, lab techs, or postdocs of this, so it's up to some faculty and students who \*do\* know to inform others of the report. And in the report, not only do you find the details of this incident, but a substantial amount of evidence that this a repeated pattern of behavior for this prof, and that other profs were aware of this. The profs who knew are also interviewed in the investigative report, and some express outright disrespectful views that dismiss reporting rules, dismiss the severity of his repeated actions, and belittle the victims in question for being weak and causing trouble. And after all is said and done, the prof isn't fired and the department leadership still does almost nothing to inform or protect students, lab techs, and postdocs. So, as an observing grad student who already has personal experiences of being sexually harassed and assaulted and afterwards vilified and disbelieved, and now you see the same thing happen to another grad student in a situation where there is even physical proof and multiple eyewitness accounts of many of the prof's actions...do you think this is a system in which you'd feel great about reporting? Do you think this would create a professional, welcoming environment? This is a situation I've experienced first-hand, and I personally know others in a related department at my university as well as in the same field but at a different university who've experienced a similar situation.

7. I have discussed some examples of what could be considered sexual harassment and sexism. You can feel how you feel about whether these experiences ""should"" be bearable, but the fact is that many studies have shown that these kind of things, in addition to other forms of discrimination such as racism and ableism, do have negative effects on undergrads, grad students, and professional researchers in academia &amp; industry. And that those negative psychological effects can impact the student or researcher's career trajectory.

I also don't appreciate it when people bring up the frequency of sexual misconduct in other workplaces. I'm not saying that it's what \*you're\* necessarily saying here specifically, but it's something I've definitely heard from other male profs. I dislike it because it 1) insinuates that I've never worked another job when I have, 2) implies that I'm unaware of the prevalence of sexual misconduct which is extremely far from the truth, and 3) feels like an excuse not to care about sexual misconduct or do anything to prevent it. I'd also add that one of the big things I feel is somewhat different in STEM jobs (&amp; other academic jobs and probably many business or legal jobs) vs. some other work environments is the intimacy of  the workplace. Departments usually are fairly small; most people work excessively so you are interacting with the small group very frequently; conferences, receptions, and invited talks often involve traveling with others, sometimes overnight, and there's often pressure to drink alcohol at certain events &amp; be around lots of intoxicated people; you're pressured to be in constant correspondence with coworkers and collaborators via email, phone, video calling, etc. even when not at the workplace; mentoring is very close and intimate; because specific research topic circles are often so small, individuals with power can have a significant impact on not just your current job, but your ability to conduct meaningful research in that topic field again; etc. The other work environments I've experienced, and those my parents have experienced, are much more get in, get work done, get out, without the constant socialization with coworkers or intimacy of work relationships. That cuts down the number of opportunities for sexual misconduct to occur, but by no means eliminates them.

8. As far as the diversity committee goes, I'd first argue that this isn't something that is driven only by members of the committee. I'm not sure what the situation at your university is that, but this year mine and several others I've heard of have really ramped up their diversity talk. My university as a whole now has a diversity team as do other departments within the university. And as universities become increasingly diverse as the demographics of the U.S. change, I'd imagine they'll increasingly want to come off as inclusive and welcoming. So, universities and departments now \*want\* students, postdocs, and faculty to engage in diversity committees. But in my department, ours is almost exclusively women, and the few men involved are almost all of color, disabled, from another country, or gay. And this is overall unsurprising - studies have shown that members of the groups D&amp;I initiatives are targeted at are disproportionately engaged in D&amp;I work. That's because we really want the culture to change because it really isn't  working for us. 

And I'd also warn that in addition to universities and departments wanting to come off as inclusive by having D&amp;I committees, there are people outside the university who care about this as well. Our department is dealing with a large number of more recent alumni refusing to do promotional work for the department or recommend the department to prospective grad students &amp; postdocs. And I can think of two other departments who, in the past ten years or so, had some backlash from alumni, donors, and the community after a sexual harassment scandal went public. So, to sum it up, I am engaged in D&amp;I work because 1) the university and department wants it to happen, 2) I personally would benefit greatly from making things more inclusive for female, queer, and disabled members, 3) because of my experiences I care deeply about making the experience more supportive for other kinds of diverse groups such as scientists of color and trans scientists, and 4) there are real ramifications to having a noninclusive department in these changing times. I believe, therefore, that D&amp;I work \*is\* very valuable, and it shouldn't be on the people who need change to happen the most to do all the work.

My 2 year master degree due to mental health issues and a divorce turned into a 6 year journey and he always supported me and found ways for me to stay in the program while I got better.  He worked with other students in similar ways I know too.   

The time keeping is stricter than other labs, but the grants we work on usually wants to know how our time was spent at the end of the year, so the time keeping makes this extremely easy, and if our hours are ever questioned he can go back week by week and detail what we did.  So it keeps us honest, but also covers our butts if stuff goes south.

The trade-off for the strictness is everyone that works with him averages one book chapter every other year and one publication a year.   In my first two years I did two articles, one of which was one of the most read articles in my area that year.  My friend who been with him for 6 years on her PhD did four articles and 9 papers.

ggdn39g,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"It is a value of mine that a college or university should be invested in supporting every student and having every student be able to graduate. Students struggle for a variety of reasons: the material is challenging, lack of study skills, challenges with work-life balance, physical or mental health challenges, having to work 20 or 30 or 40 hours per week to pay for school or support family members, having family issues, and more. For students who are from underrepresented backgrounds at their university (e.g., students of color at a predominantly white institution, women in majors that have predominantly men, etc.), biases such as racism and sexism, among many others, play a role in their experience.

A college cannot eliminate every one of these struggles (though there are things they can do for some of them), and I do not believe in watering down the rigor of courses (though professors should also know what is an appropriate level of rigor in context). At the same time, it's important to recognize that a system that fails to support all students will, in effect, privilege students who come from the most well-represented backgrounds and circumstances.

I'll add that an environment in which only a small subset of students will be able to graduate will lead to immense anxiety and a lack of collegiality as students see their classmates not as friends or collaborators, but as competition. It would do this without any discernable benefit. By all means, if a student does not know the material, etc., they should not pass their classes.

Of course the individual should make the final decision, I said that originally  -to consider your circumstances and get proper advice.

&gt;However the mental health is significantly lower too rn, especially from the burnout and having breaks removed. 

 I have news for you - in grown up world I have to work for more than 14 weeks without a break all  the time. Like for 20 years. Competitive programs expect you to be able to do that. Many of these specifically ask about such things on the recommendation forms.

&gt;“It won’t bring it down to make a difference” is very subjective

2 semesters of 4 -3 credit classes with all A-s is a 4.0.  With one B- is a 3.84.  That is not subjective, that is math.

Anyone at a competitive engineering job is not going to think that the P =  a decent grade regardless of the GPA.

There is no world in which the GPA is the only factor, unless you are under the minimum requirement for application, in which case this b- is not the problem  because the having the minimum GPA  for application is not going to be , on its own , competitive either.






In competitive programs there are going to be plenty of people who did not take the P and still got good grades.

I am betting if there were forced P/F and not opt in, that people are going to be asking for actual letter grade documentation at some point.

I also didn't say it was fair.  You asked what I thought would happen.

gh3ropy,Jagable,t2_dknxu,"I took what ended up being a 4 month sick leave to deal with my mental health. I have struggle my whole life, but I had things at a ""manageable"" level. The stressors of the PhD were accumulating after getting 2 years into a 3 year program. Part of my project brought me to Australia, already very far from my support network, I got worse, and then the bushfires started and I just couldn't cope anymore. Told my supervisor I needed to get out and sort things out. Everyone ended up being very supportive.

Once back home, I immediately started the process for therapy, rest, and healing. I didn't know what was ""wrong"" with me yet, but I was using the time to give myself the space to find out. I intentionally kept my social life to a minimum, I didn't want to be running around stressing myself out further, distracting myself from why I took a break. Then the pandemic shut downs began and I really had time to get into my shit. I found a longer term care plan to address my mental health, and when I was finally no longer in a critical phase, I decided to return to my project. Largely because of the support i received over requesting accommodation to support my return. 

Honestly the stress of academia is not something I think I will ever be able to tolerate, unless I can make real progress in my mental state. I probably wouldn't have gone back to the position if I wouldn't have then risked my residency status in this country. I am almost done now,  basically just need a defense date, so thank fuck for that.

em28zax,HumanDrinkingTea,t2_o4xhq,"As someone who has received accommodations for a disability, I'd like to speak on behalf of a ""minority"" demographic that I'm sure populates this subreddit at significantly higher proportions than the general population.

There is a subgroup of people known in k-12 special-ed lingo as ""twice exceptional."" These are individuals who are both gifted and disabled-- who have extreme potential but tend to drastically under-perform.  

Many of us grapple with both our potential and our limitations. The message that many individuals who are skeptical about the validity of accommodations send us is that it doesn't matter what we are capable of. If we have a bad day now and then, too bad. 

Some of us have much to offer this world, but if I have a seizure (or some highly stigmatized mental health episode) during a high workload week, then it doesn't matter. I cannot share capabilities with the world. Just because my brain does not work on someone else's schedule. 

Many people cannot grasp the concept of ""twice-exceptionality."" Either you're ""smart and capable"" or ""dumb and incompetent."" I once told a redditor that I had a professor (PhD in Math) who had a learning disability and the redditor accused me of lying, because ""people with learning disabilities can't graduate college.""

People are more complex than that. Most people just want to demonstrate their true capabilities, and for many, all it takes to do so is some flexibility or some extra time on a test. 

I certainly do not condone reduced rigor of classes. But increased flexibility for individuals who are facing personal challenges? That's not reduced rigor-- that's allowing people to take time to tend to their very real health needs. The assignment will still be there when they get back (I assume you're not getting rid of assignments in their entirety-- just allowing them to be done on a time-table that is more convenient to students). 

Reducing rigor would imply that you are decreasing standards for what constitutes ""A"" level work. The disability laws specifically state that this is something that you do not need to do, and if it something you are being pushed to do, I would give a nice nudge back in their direction (I understand the political pressures, but if you are genuinely being asked to lower standards, then that is a problem). 

Remember, the laws that dictate you must be given accommodations in school are laws that apply in the ""real world"" too. A person cannot be fired for a disability unless it actually affects job performance. A person must be given reasonable accommodations. 

More and more people are able to go to school and fulfill their true potential as a result of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I see this as nothing but a good thing. 

Again, if you are *actually* reducing rigor, this is something you should push back on (if you can without getting yourself into too much hot water). But extending flexibility to those who need it is most certainly a positive development. Students have a right to be imperfect humans (hopefully they'll realize this someday, too).",1,2019-04-29 14:58:52,AskAcademia

Grad school can take down those who are 100% neurotypical and who have no difficulties in their personal lives, and it doesn't sound like you're in the right headspace at the moment.

eorzcnh,Sound_and_Science,t2_3rlrk25i,"I've really struggled with something very similar. I absolutely love writing (worked as a copy editor in college and picked up a fiction-writing hobby in grad school partly as a way to cope with stress). However, every single time I've had major academic writing projects they've been associated with pretty serious mental health episodes (Panic attacks, worsening of OCD compulsions, and serious burnout). YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT ALONE.

I have to admit to also worrying about whether I'm compatible with a long-term career in academia, so I can't be of much help there. But I can share some of the coping strategies that have at least gotten me through my PhD program so far:

\- Most Universities offer some form of therapy/counseling services for students. There's a reason for that. I think everyone struggles with mental health issues of one form or another, but graduate school has a way of taking low-lying issues and ramping them up until your brain is basically on fire. Use this resource proactively, and work with a professional to understand why you react the way you do and develop specific strategies to deal with it. 

\- Try to ignore deadlines. By which I mean: start early enough with a regular schedule that you can focus on writing and not the impending doom of ""the thing"" (whatever it is) being due. If you can set aside just half an hour a day early on to commit to writing, you'll get yourself in the routine of sitting down and generating words. You'll probably have to scale that up to longer and more frequent writing sessions at some point, but that way you have a ""functional writing unit system"" that you're comfortable with by the deadline pressure really sets in (see also the Pomodoro method)

\- As much as we all know it, but it's hard to truly internalize: Done is better than perfect.

\- I've personally found that the really technical parts of academic writing (methods, figure legends, even results sections) are the things I struggle most with, whereas things that are arguably harder to write (introduction and discussion sections) come much easier. This is the opposite of what a lot of my lab-mates have told me. I think it's because there's just a little more room for the creativity (dare I say artistry? Is there room for that in academia?) that I enjoy as part of writing, and so I have more fun writing them. If you can find any way to tap into that when you get to those sections, it may help. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope that helps. I promise it is do-able, and while unfortunately I don't have a way of truly eliminating all the stress and anxiety of academic writing, I have found effective ways to get it done anyway.

That said, whether or not it's legally covered under the ADA probably has very little to do with whether or not you'll actually get accommodations - I'd imagine part of the reason that the belief that it isn't covered by the ADA is so persistent is because in practice it isn't.

First year - coursework, second year - written quals, third year - oral quals/proposal, fourth year - dissertation defense. I had solid funding throughout (first two years on fellowship, unsuccessful app for an external fellowship so funded third year by TA-ing, and fourth year got an internal fellowship) and a better than average relationship with my adviser. My adviser was very supportive and knowledgable, and after some time I figured out how to get our work styles to harmonize better. It's neat now to think about how that mentoring rapport improved over time - I had never had that experience before. I also worked in health services research role 50% time during my PhD and was able to use the data and some of the tasks for my graduate work - so that made it a lot more efficient and gave me an opportunity to publish more papers outside my dissertation. I entered with zero papers and finished with six, plus others that were under review or in progress. 

I definitely had mental health struggles, but they started when I was a child and were worse before grad school. I had such a hard time mentally/emotionally in college, and I thought it was because college was hard, and then my mental health got way worse when I was working. So the PhD didn't cause my mental health issues, but like any other job there would be times that mental illness got in the way of work/life. Having a goal (getting a PhD to be capable of doing interesting and impactful work to improve health) was a good impetus to really learn how to manage my mental illness. Did a lot of therapy and started meds, and honestly, having the incremental goals and progress really helped. Ultimately, all of those things, plus the relationships I was able to develop as a result of getting my shit together mentally, made grad school a markedly better time than anything I'd experienced before. Of course research and grad school is a roller coaster, and I'm delighted that I'm past it and more autonomous now, but it really was the best time of my life up until that point.

“Your initial post seemed to imply that you don't believe (via your friends who are academics) that stable jobs exist at all.”


You’re right, I didn’t. You changed that belief – at least as far as the US goes.

“You've since edited your OP to indicate that you're interested in applied anthropology. That's absolutely a realistic career goal / area in which to work with a PhD in anthropological linguistics. But if that's something you want to do, then you need to be crafting and structuring your experience, knowledge, skills, and network (as well as your research goals) toward that. Applied positions in linguistics are wide-ranging, but what you need in the way of marketable skills to make the jump into a stable, decent-paying job as an applied anthropological linguist will not necessarily be what a PhD program automatically gives you. You'll have to seek out those things.”

Thank you, this is all really good advice.

“As to the rest... your original post seemed starry eyed about the life of a PhD student. Sharing your enthusiasm with students, late night intense talks about theory, etc. These things happen, but the life of a PhD student is predominately research and writing.”

I said nothing about late night intense talks in my OP. Whhat I said was that I wanted to spend time ""in conversation with other enthusiasts"". For what it’s worth, I have spent hours discussing theories with professors and PhD students over wine ;), but that was about 5% of my academic experience so far and it does not define my expectation of doing a PhD. I expect loneliness, I expect sexism, I expect having to fight my corner to get funding, I expect being broke, I expect my work becoming increasingly specialized so that there are fewer and fewer people I can have a deep conversation with about my research, I expect consistently having to work on my mental health (I have pre-existing mental health struggles that I don't intend to let stop me). I expect it to be all those things, but for there to also be moments of connection with other people passionate or curious about your topic, for there to be occasional undergrads who *do* care, for there to be weeks in the field where you feel so full of life you could burst. I expect all that and I want to do it all anyway, because I just want to know more about my research topic and become a better anthropologist. Does that sound more balanced? I was kind of just showing the positive sides in my original comment because I assumed everyone would know about the downsides and take them as a given – that clearly backfired since I gave you the impression I didn’t see any downsides :D

“In an academic job, you may get more of a chance to teach students who actually are interested in your area of research. At times (and if you have a good cohort) you might have a chance to have some fun, intense theory discussions. But you will be busy trying to meet deadlines, dealing with research and coursework, and generally swamped with a variety of often menial-seeming or mundane things.”

You’re describing exactly why it doesn’t appeal to me as a career anymore.

“Having gone through a PhD program where I did have a good cohort, made some great friends, did some fun collaborative work, had a few great talks about theory over beers, and had a few (out of many) interested undergrads in the sections I taught, I can tell you that the things that you look forward to do exist. But they are often lost in the other things that go on as a PhD student. Emotional disarray, frustration with research and advisors and fellow students, relationship woes, financial woes, feelings of inadequacy... these are also things that are characteristic of PhD student experiences-- and in many ways, they can be far more common. I experienced all of these as well during my PhD program.”

I mean honestly this sounds like exactly what I think will happen.

“Bottom line: You need a clear picture of what you'd be getting yourself into.”

I think I do. I just really didn’t make that clear, huh?

“If you don't like hearing about the negative, or think I'm taking a shit on your parade... well, keeping yourself in the dark isn't a good way to go at this. You need to know everything. If all you want to hear is how much fun being in a PhD program is and how much it matches your ideal image of what it is, then you're going to end up very disappointed.” 

I know the negatives. I didn’t like your assumption that I didn’t. I just take the negatives as a given.

I wish I could say it gets better after graduation, but that's a big disclaimer about research - it will never be done, no matter how much you work, there is not some magic time when you have ""discovered enough"" and can cool off. It took me awhile, buried in my own work, to realize this - I spent some time with a few ""big"" shots in my field who were approaching their 90s and still going to lab, they certainly didn't seem like they had ""gotten"" anywhere. People who feel like they have made that type of a contribution are probably arrogant asses.

The good thing is that there are also a ton of people out there in academia/research/what have you who understand this, and are still happy, fulfilled by it, and most importantly, understand that their work is only a small part of their life. I know it seems impossible to have all that, and maybe it is for certain people in certain careers (for instance, I realized quickly that working as a professor at a big fancy school was definitely not for me). 

But I am absolutely convinced (though I sometimes forget it) that research is not worth going into, and it is doomed to fail in general, if it is going to keep asking people to sacrifice their lives and mental health to practice it as a profession. No matter how many papers, citations (yuck), etc. people have, if they are making your or other people's lives shitty by making you work too hard then academia would be much better off without them. A future of grimmer and grimmer competition and work addition is not something the vast majority of people want to be a part of. 

Sorry for the novel. This is all to say that you are worth far more than your work, and you should not feel bad about thinking that.

e0eash7,SnowblindAlbino,t2_7ild5,"Be sure to follow up with your school asap, likely Academic Advising as well as the faculty in question. At my university all incompletes revert to F grades automatically at the conclusion of the following semester if the grade is not updated  (i..e a spring incomplete would become an F the following December). Exceptions are made, of course, but they must be requested. I'm sure one would be granted in a case of medical/mental health issues.

From the faculty side, my colleagues and I would likely not be ""annoyed"" at a long incomplete, but it would raise serious concerns about the learning objectives associated with the assignment. If you are writing a paper a full year (or more?) after the course ended, what chance is there that you are actually applying the skills/knowledge/concepts from that course as intended? That far out I would personally assume the student would be making a cursory effort to clear the incomplete grade, rather than actually doing what was expected of students who completed the assignment on time. I wouldn't grade it differently, but my expectations would be much lower. I've had my fair share of such incompletes over the years and they tend to hover around a C grade, if only because the student doing to work has lost touch with the material on which the assignment was based.

Don't be surprised to get a \*very\* cursory response when these are submitted as well.

I teach undergrad and grad students, at the BA, MA and PhD levels. Some of them are great, some of them mediocre, some of the rather poor students. Each one of them comes from a different background. This is what I think, and I hope it helps you.

The thing that matters the most is your health. Whatever you choose to do, do it so that you grow better, brighter and bigger. Make your choices open doors. Don't set yourself up for failure. And if you've been depressed and even suicidal, don't play with fire.

I'm a pretty easygoing guy. Happy-go-lucky, no drama. I got into my PhD program and became depressed, gained 40 pounds in 3 and a half years, started having anxiety, palpitations and panic attacks every day or two. I'd wake up in the middle of the night having nightmares. Its been a fews years since I graduated and I still get anxious some times. PhDs in the US (in top schools) can be brutal. Don't put yourself through that. In the UK theyre more relaxed, but the uncertainty of the job market can make it awful. As a social anthropologist you will not be in a good spot to become a lecturer (since that's what you want). And as a degree, it won't open you amhy more doors than a MA would. It's possible that once you graduate you'll land a postdoc, maybe two. But the academic job market is DREADFUL. And thag will mess up with you loads. 

The reason I brought up my students earlier is because I see many of them go through the same I went through in grad school.

I am not calling you a terrible person, you placed that descriptor on yourself. I recommended professional assistance because many universities have free services available to students, especially in cases of medical emergencies. I had no idea of your prior experience and I can only offer my heartfelt sympathy for having to suffer such an asshole.

If I were to ask a single question, it would be ""why do you think that finishing your degree is the only answer and stepping away from it will doom you?""

From a personal perspective, I used to think university was the answer. It took me 7 years of bashing my head against the brick wall before I realized it wasn't the place for me, and it was making my problems worse. During those days, I went through the range from suicidal depression to manic phases and PTSD where I couldn't sleep which resulted in a diagnosis of psychosis.

That being said, you had an undiagnosed mental health problem, and went off your medication and/or introduced new medication that inhibited your performance.

It shouldn’t reflect badly on you that you took longer to get your degree. You can always disclose it as “medical reasons” &amp; most wouldn’t ask further questions than that. Good grades don’t necessarily mean someone will be cut out for a PhD, and the opposite is also true! 

I know it’s cliche, but I’d try to not compare yourself too much with other peers who may appear to have more on their CV.

I was not ""OK"" with it. I *accepted* it because I am mature enough to realize you cannot force people to accept you if you don't fit in their little group. I was mature enough to have a *professional* relationship with them (and a pretty good one) without wanting to be their buddies. As you should in a workplace. That they *were* buddies did not make me want to cry for justice and force them not to go out for drinks if they won't invite me. Because frankly it's childish.


Academia is not a good place for work-life balance; this is why I left it. It's nothing new. The current attempts by self-proclaimed social justice warriors to right every wrong is simply stupid at the highest levels. It's a high stress, high workload environment, and definitely not an office with a 9/5 schedule, so you really should not apply the same standards there as in a stupid multinational pencil pusher job.

Oh my... did not think mentoring on the scientific method was in the forefront of bar-conversations...), then perhaps she really is not cut out to be weathering out the brutal trials and tribulations of academia. Because guess what. It's a really freaking brutal world to *everyone*. If not getting a drink with people who don't even seem to like you makes you break down crying you will have serious issues even in a cushy, well paying job, let alone in academia.


&gt;Many good scientists are being forced to leave the academia.

Because they are not invited out to drink with the others. Personally I left because I realized I won't be able to hold down a relationship long enough to propose, marry and have kids, but maybe the drinks had a role in it, too.

&gt;We need balance, ethics and respect in the workplace. 

Yes. We do. And you are standing on the soapbox demanding respect in a workplace in a thread discussing things *outside* of the workplace. You see the irony here? There is so much abuse in academia it's not even funny and here you are baying to forbid adults to go out and have some time for themselves as they wish.


&gt;We should also stop thinking that academics are allowed to be jerks, racists, sexists.


Sure thing. Which OP's colleagues are not based on what she wrote, so it's absolutely a non-sensical statement in this context. They just not inviting her to their drinks for whatever reason. But you, and the rest decided that the only reason can be her vagina  (without ifs or whats). It may equally be because 

1. she is new to the group, and not been accepted yet
2. her personality does not fit with theirs (they don't like her)
3. they do not wish to get in trouble for precisely the same crowd demanding them to stop going out for hanging out with a female outside of work
4. they do wish to have a men-only time for themselves where they can relax
5. or any other reasons -all of them being a valid one.

She can either accept it, or do another adult thing, and *ask them* (I know it's a revolutionary thought), or move to a different lab if it is so taxing her mental health is in danger.


EDIT: it's really amusing to see how OP complains about not getting the same treatment in lab (suck it up), but kind of expects the princess treatment with her problem of not getting accepted socially into the lab.

g1ghnym,giggle_crack,t2_6g8mh,"I recently got diagnosed a couple months ago, in the last year of my PhD. It didn't even cross my mind that I could have ADHD, I just always thought I was lazy, anxious, or depressed. I was haunted by the phrase ""not PhD material"". I was even in therapy to address my anxiety. The topic of ADHD just never came up. 

I drew out really nice plans and schedules for my days/weeks, structured my days, tried all sorts of productivity hacks, mental approaches, etc. but I wouldn't be able to stick with it very long, or I'd get extremely burnt out after a week or two from the effort of just DOING things on time. 

It wasn't until my psychiatrist friend got concerned about my frustrations with school, and started asking about my childhood study habits, things I thought were totally normal (daydreaming for hours, spacing out in class, not knowing what we're supposed to be doing in group exercises, low self esteem and picking at my hands until they bled from anxiety)... all the way to my habits now (spacing out every minute in lab meetings, can't finish projects, always late, now as an adult). 

The way he said it was, everyone might benefit from a stimulant in some way or another, but the right treatment for the right patient could have far-reaching benefits beyond ""just productivity"". I had nothing to lose-- if the positive benefits outweigh the negative side effects, it's worth a try. He also said women are more likely to be misdiagnosed with anxiety or depression.

I'm on the lowest dose of Concerta, and it is life-changing in the most subtle ways. For example, I didn't even know I had issues getting out the door in the mornings. Apparently it's possible to get ready and be out the door in less than an hour, and I used to get stuck spacing out while getting dressed, sometimes up to an hour or more. My mental health is drastically improved-- I feel more present, and I can actually regulate and manage my emotions. I can actually practice the cognitive behavioral tools I learned in therapy, and they make SO MUCH SENSE now. I can actually sit through lab meetings and follow along!! 

I still struggle with motivation and getting started on shit I don't want to do at work, but now I know it's more to do with the anxiety and fear of failure and not because I'm ""not PhD material"". The meds and CBT have helped immensely for me to manage those feelings and start changing my behaviors and approach more organically.",1,2020-08-14 16:40:07,AskAcademia
g1g6j7b,pastaandpizza,t2_5g1cw,"I was ""unbiasedly"" diagnosed by a new doctor.  I moved cities to start my post-doc so I had to find a new primary care doctor.  On my first visit they had me fill out a long health questionnaire on an ipad.  When he came in to see me he basically asked when I was diagnosed with ADHD and I laughed and was like sorry you've got the wrong patient.

He said on my survey I scored very high for adult ADHD.  I laughed again and said doesn't everyone score for ADHD nowadays? No one can pay attention to anything for more than a second.  He was not laughing with me and basically said less than 5% of new patients score for ADHD and those that do are mostly all already diagnosed and that we had to address this during this visit.  

Without knowing anything about me he said that there is a large group of people my age (25-25) that weren't diagnosed as kids because 1) we grew up in an environment were ADHD wasn't widely considered ""real"" by that generation of parents 2) were smart enough to be able to get by in school ie you could still do your home work without paying attention to 100% of the lesson in class 3) having good grades means you were less likely to get flagged for behavior issues which typically are the tipping point for psych evals as kids 4) are currently still high achieving academically 5) have found methods to ""self-medicate,"" particularly caffeine addictions or habits you need to stabilize your mood.

I was embarrassed that I literally checked off every single box.  I was like well doc, I just got my PhD and I drink 64 ounces of caffeinated drinks a day, but I don't really think I have the symptoms of ADHD.  He basically told me I fit the mold so well that if I were to try medication for it I would instantly realize what my symptoms are, as they can vary between people, and the extreme 180 of being on the meds will make what was ""wrong"" before super clear once the meds make it ""right"".  

Taking my first Ritalin completely changed my world view.  The very first thing that changed was not what I expected. Taking out the trash used to cause me physical discomfort - tension in my chest and neck and just an overall mental dread of thinking I have to take the trash out - and I just assumed everyone was like that.  When my wife would take out the trash I just assumed it was a passive aggressive move against me, because its such an awful task she's just showing me she's willing to do it and I'm not. 30 minutes on my Ritalin, while I was thinking ""this stuff isn't working at all"" my wife asked me to take out the trash and I was like yea sure and took it out no problem.  Why WOUDLN'T I want to take out the trash? It would make the kitchen smell bad if I didn't and it's like 10 steps from the trash can to the garage.  When I walked back inside and realized I had just basically *wanted* to take out the trash I nearly cried.  To think how many things in my life have been difficult, which could have been easier, and to think how many times I completely misjudged other people's actions based on my assumptions (my wife taking out the trash was somehow passive aggressive and not a normal or kind gesture of taking care of our home??) just completely rocked me.

That being said, I don't respond super well to medications (non-stimulants give me bad side effects and even max dose extended release stimulants only last a total of 6 hours a day for me) but just knowing and understanding the condition has helped me significantly.

It’s important that if you ever feel overwhelmed or find yourself constantly on the verge of tears, you access mental health services available in your campus. Graduate school has a way of exacerbating underlying anxiety disorders or creating new ones.

gqb0ovm,Quaternion253,t2_9487g0zm,"Hi,   


I'm also a master's student in Physics from India. I get where you're coming from.   


I would suggest finishing your MSc and maybe working for a year or so, in a related area. I know that post an MSc you can apply to be a scientific officer in Government institutions and labs and such. BARC, ONGC and other places come to mind. Maybe take a year to do this and see how you feel. It would certainly reduce the kind of stress you're feeling while trying to study, but also keep you occupied and in touch with what you've studied, atleast relative to a job in a completely different area. At the end of the year, you can take the entrance exams again, if you so wish to. Alternatively you could just take a year off after the MSc to figure out how you want to go forward. Maybe you can even prepare for the entrances then.   


In either case, I would suggest seeking help from a mental health professional. Your university might already offer people (although knowing India this is likely either absent or just bad). From personal experience, it is very difficult to focus and/or study when your mind is racing and the anxious thoughts don't stop. And because you can't study the thoughts get worse. It is important to break this vicious cycle. Maybe try picking up an unrelated hobby and set aside time where you are not going to study and just going to do something to relax.",1,2021-03-09 07:38:31,AskAcademia
gqakde6,wantonyak,t2_dgs2rvt,"Some suggestions that are adjacent to other suggestions proffered in this thread:

Read for pleasure. You'd be surprised what can inspire you. And if you burn out on academic writings, you run the risk of not being able to force yourself to read something important when you need to.

Take time to recharge. Whatever self care is for you, do it. You'll need it.

Take the free time to get into a healthy routine. Balance is a huge challenge in grad school; having a routine of sleeping 8 hours a night, exercising, stretching (avoid that student posture!), resting your eyes periodically, cooking healthy meals, etc that you continue into the more stressful periods of your graduate career will be immeasurably beneficial. 

Similarly, start taking a multivitamin. You wouldn't believe how much more energy and mental clarity you can get from nutritional balance. 


Find a therapist. This one was already said, but worth repeating. Do it now. Trust me. 

Take time to see/talk to friends. Don't neglect your friendships, both with labmates and non-grad school friends. This will help you recharge and will ensure you have strong friendships waiting waiting in the wings for that first (and fiftieth) grad school meltdown. 

All of these practices will make you a healthier, more balanced person. And, contrary to popular media, health and balance are beneficial to being a scientist. *(Obviously getting nutrients from your diet is preferable, but not realistic for most people.)*",1,2021-03-09 04:13:56,AskAcademia

Is there a realistic scenario where you can get (maybe even pay?) someone to guide you through the program, get some useable data fairly quickly and produce 10,000 good-enough words WHILE keeping your mental and emotional wellbeing a priority? That last part is important, if you finish your thesis but are in such a bad place by the end of it that you aren't in a position to seek employment, then you will lose potential income, and have a big gap on your resume.

I just wanted to call out these comments first just because they feel like there is a lot of underlying judgement, and possibly towards yourself. Procrastination is normal and you shouldn't feel any negativity towards wanting time to yourself every now and then. It only becomes an issue when it becomes chronic, and even then, it still isn't some kind of terrible personality trait because it is a product of underlying challenges. 
  
You are allowed to let yourself feel upset and to step away from your responsibilities to take care of yourself. The important caveat is that you bring awareness and non-judgement to how you manage whatever is challenging you.
  
I would absolutely recommend therapy based on your OP (therapy is never a bad idea, even if you feel like you don't need it). They can help you explore your thoughts and feelings, and really put a language to your experiences. It is a very empowering opportunity and can make sure you are equipped to be aware and non-judgy of how your mind is responding to the challenges around you.
  
The other thing I would suggest if you really don't want to do therapy right now is mindfulness meditation. The idea behind anxiety is that you are in a constant adrenaline rush thats triggered by stress. If the brain doesn't practice calming itself then it rewires itself to more efficiently operate in a stressed state and you end up just feeling stressed at a basal level. Mindfulness teaches your brain how to focus and observe your thoughts in a non-judgemental way so that you can give your brain the space to move on.

I had to get surgery less than a month after I was diagnosed and then take a month of leave for recovery. I didn't get chemo or radiation because RCC is typically highly resistant to them both.

Even after physically recovering, I still had to deal with post-surgical fatigue and mental health issues, and I've had multiple cancer recurrence scares that have required detailed follow ups. When I was first diagnosed, I thought I'd be able to maintain my normal life after surgery, but to be honest, I still haven't fully recovered my energy or mental and emotional health. In my case, my lab also lost funding right after I got back from surgery, and then COVID happened like 6 months later. 

I took another post-doc to avoid an an employment gap (because maintaining continuous health insurance is now critical), but this whole chain of events has largely closed the door on an academic career for me. I'm from a working class family who can't financially support me, and I have student loan debt, so I can't justify the risk of trying to play the academic lottery when so few stable academic research positions exist and the competition is greater than ever.

What the other person mentioned is true, but I would actually argue that either of these three degrees can give you the knowledge and ability to do what you want to do. To be 110% straightforward with you, it’s actually all about **in what way** you want to want to help the population you want to work with.

Bear with me as I go on a tangent:

Mental Health Counselors will usually work with “patients” who’s received a diagnosis for some type of issue or illness and do 1:1 talk therapy to help them cope with what they have going on and how to beat most past that problem to create a better quality of life. Whatever that problem is that they have is believed to originate from within themselves.

Marriage and Family Therapists will often do the same thing, but they don’t see the nature of the problem from the person. Rather, they see the issue as something that stems from a relationship with another person (doesn’t have to be a spouse or family member). Then they help fix that problem with their “clients” by creating effective and efficient ways to better communicate how the person feels about everything (not as easy as it sounds).

Social Workers do kind of a cross between the first two, but they actually take things a step back by examining the environment that the person is in which may be the root cause of the problem they’re facing. They’ll work with their client or patient to fix the issue within the environment itself.

(If your school doesn’t have these, an occupational therapist would also be a good choice!) These folks often cater to students with learning differences, anxiety, depression, etc. who just need a little bit of extra help in tackling college coursework for any number of reasons, and I think it would be great to reach out to them for the concrete tips, but also the social support, as well.

However, if you're a typical aged college student (under 23), realize that the early 20s are a time when mental health issues, stress, and general life anxiety tends to hit you. Dropping out of college can expose you to the same kind of aimlessness and frustration, but without the structure and support of the college environment.

This is about a manager dealing with this exact dilemma. How you do contribute to the destigmatization of mental health issues, without oversharing? Read the comments for a variety of perspectives, but a general consensus that while mental health issues can be an explanation, they cannot be an excuse.

This article talks about how ""being professional"" means maintaining a relatively even keel, and not letting a bad day or bad mood significantly impact how you interact with people.

\#1 here talks about how sharing feelings isn't great in the workplace. While this is about mandatory sharing of feelings, it shares similar dynamics to regularly sharing the state of your emotional health -- not really appropriate for the workplace because it shifts the burden of managing your feelings and emotions onto others.

If someone was in a car wreck and said, ""Yeah, I was in an accident and was in traction for 6 months"", it would not be considered TMI or ""unprofessional"". But saying ""I was the victim of sexual assault and was in therapy for PTSD"" is considered ""unprofessional"". What does that say about the definition of ""professionalism""?

Here are some of the (well-intentioned and pragmatic) comments on this thread:

&gt;No. Way, way too much information. Don't mention specific diagnoses  
&gt;  
&gt;If you are asked, speak in broad terms. Saying ""I experienced some health concerns that caused a delay in my studies, and I am healthy and doing better now"" is sufficient.   
&gt;  
&gt;From the perspective of an employer, *even a very sympathetic one*, someone with a mental illness is a risk... On top of that, most people consider mental illness and trauma to be TMI  
&gt;  
&gt;Just say health issues. You could be setting yourself up for discrimination or even just making an interview awkward with too much information  
&gt;  
&gt;You should just cite resolved health issues, yeah. The less information the better, and the less chance that it could hurt you. 

The two themes that I see in these comments are:  
1) The subjects of sexual assault and mental illness make people ""uncomfortable"" and should never be discussed at work, unlike similar issues.  
2) Those issues must be ""resolved"" for someone to be fit for a job, whether academia, government, or private sector.

So, what do these people do in the mean time? Accumulate more gaps on their CV, which will put them at an even greater disadvantage? Why can't the people *who don't even have to live with these issues* have compassion and realize that people with disabilities can contribute if they have necessary accommodations?

ghosq2x,EpicDestroyer52,t2_1uh0xdx,"Hi, here are my answers as a Sociology PhD Candidate

&amp;#x200B;

1. You get to research whatever you want since everything is connected to society. Live your best life. Programs still exist that fund students pretty well, pay for health insurance, and the highest ranked programs place okayish (pre-covid). Doing your own work for 6 years can be very fun. If you net a job with a good (2/2 or 2/3 in soc) teaching load, sufficient research support, and tenure you may be set for life in a stimulating intellectual environment where you get to continue to study whatever you want. If you find joy mentoring and working with students there will be opportunities or requirements to do that as well.
2. When you get to do whatever you want, you can get lost. You might think the niche you discovered is interesting and be disappointed with the realities on the job market. You might become discouraged that policy-makers etc. don't listen to sociologists that much. Your friends and family might think your work is not useful or not understandable as a real job. A lot of sociology PhD programs fund students poorly or require them to do a lot of teaching. Even if you really like teaching, if someone tells you teaching a 2/2 while trying to complete your PhD/build your skills/navigate the job market/publish papers/discover your own academic trajectory isn't difficult: they are lying. You might find that the unstructured time poses challenges to your mental health. After getting your PhD if you want to be an academic you will have little control over where you live, which can make building a community and having a partner or family more difficult. You may have to do a series of poorly paid and temporary positions in the hope that you will be the 1/100 who lands the dream job. You might be wrong and not realize it until you get to the end.
3. The academic job market blows, it blows even more in Covid-era. Positions pre-covid regularly got hundreds of applications per position. The glut of candidates means people are adjuncting and taking jobs they are grossly 'overqualified' for (I know everyone has different perceptions of what jobs are the best so I put that in quotes). Getting a masters degree in sociology is usually a bad idea imho. You often have to pay for them and they don't uniquely qualify you for anything. Having a masters or phd in a social science could make you more compelling to a gov't data job or the rare non-profit that has money to burn I suppose - but having a sociology one in particular is often not more valuable than any other social science. And there are very often more efficient ways of getting those positions than spending \~6 years on average in a doctoral program (even if it is well-funded). I would generally say you should only get a PhD in sociology if the job you want requires a PhD in sociology - usually means you want to be a sociology professor.
4. Well, I would say plenty of academics are introverts. But even in grad school you will have to present at conferences, seminars, lab meetings and TA/teach students, sometimes in large numbers in intro/stats/methods if you're at a more populous institution esp. I'd say that liking to talk to others is helpful, since it makes networking more fun but plenty of my colleagues and friends loathe the experience entirely and they've done fine. And it surely isn't to the level of being 'on' as a true service profession.
5. Huge amount of burnout. People burnout of grad school and leave, people burnout on the job market (or can never get the type of job they are hoping for and have to make the decision to walk away), people burnout after becoming professors and leave. The thing that makes academia prime for burnout is that nothing ends. You published a paper? Write the next one. You taught 4 classes this semester? Prep the next 4. You won a big grant? Better start writing the next one. Of course people enact or try to enact healthy work life balance and limits for themselves. Some are very successful, some struggle since it's not easy to slough off the pressure of the profession to put in 70 hour work weeks. The job market being bad makes this worse, since you feel like you are never going to be chosen if you take breaks.",1,2021-01-01 08:35:23,AskAcademia

e7iooyf,alittleperil,t2_bng68,"There's two separate things here to address. One is your exasperation/frustration with this student, which has likely been building for a while, and two is the student switching projects.

It sounds like this student was genuinely leaning too heavily on you as a resource, and this is probably a good lesson to you on teaching someone how to find answers instead of giving answers right off. Really work through why you're frustrated. Lots of things in science feel like you're pouring your energy into something that always wants more, and you've likely worked through that feeling in the past with a project that required lots of late nights and still went nowhere. Why is this one getting to you?

Second is her switching. Right now you're sick of dealing with her and wouldn't mind her leaving, I get that, but that would do both of you a disservice. If I were you I would sit her down and try to work out exactly why she's finding this project unrewarding. If she worked through a lot of literature, she probably found it interesting at one point. How can you encourage her to rediscover what she liked about the project? Is she just discouraged by the lack of progress or has she been going along with what everyone wanted from her this whole time? 

It might not be bad for her to have more than one project to work on, so that when something is failing on one she can still feel like she's making progress. Is there any way you can encourage her to split her time instead of dropping it entirely? Could she help with one of your collaborations as well as the project she was initially on?

Finally, consider trying to encourage her to start seeing a mental health professional now, rather than later. Grad school is stressful, and finding no joy in a project you used to find interesting enough to make it the core of your thesis is potentially an indicator of depression.",1,2018-10-10 15:49:04,AskAcademia

e6ukeum,patternboy,t2_6y9ev,"My experience is with PhDs in the behavioural sciences in the UK. Yes there are long hours - definitely. Nobody makes you work long hours but to get your work done and actually get anywhere, meet deadlines with supervisors and collaborators (if applicable) and keep up with the various distractions, you pretty much have to work long hours. It's an important skill you have to learn during the PhD - actually making sure you don't overwork yourself. If you do, you're virtually guaranteed to develop some degree of clinically significant depression for at least the period after you've overworked yourself. Some students find themselves anxious and depressed throughout (for various reasons). But at my institution, there isn't cutthroat competition the way your friend describes. We actually care about each other and work as a team. If people are competitive in what could be seen as unethical ways, they sure don't let everyone know! I think that's more a US thing. 

No, here we have 3 or sometimes 4 year PhDs (with possible extension of a year at the end if needed), but once you get funding, you're funded for that entire time unless you blatantly don't want to do it or are simply failing to do any work, etc. But you get anxious anyway because you feel like you're not getting enough done, and inevitably you feel like you're not as knowledgeable as virtually everyone else around you. Self-esteem and self-reflection are almost vital to prevent this getting on top of you.

Yes, having a bad supervisor can be very harmful. But usually, you'll find out whether you have a bad supervisor somewhere in the first year. At my institution, it is possible to switch supervisors to someone in the same department (though inevitably it's a hard thing to consider), and some supervisors can actually get banned from supervising students if they show a pattern of being abusive, completely unresponsive etc. It's just bad for students' mental health, which is already bad enough without bad supervisors. But yeah it's not as easy as I'm making it sound, and often people do end up just sucking it up and trying to 'manage' their supervisor. But this is a risk anywhere in life. At a regular job, you could have a fallout without your boss, but you also run into any number of new supervisors/managers who you may not like. ",1,2018-09-29 11:57:07,AskAcademia

If you take time off now or just keep your workload minimal, and devote your lab time to mental health and self care, you can come back later and perhaps your projects will be ready to begin and you will be able to give them your best effort.

2). Projects are allocated to who can best do them, not who wants them. If you want the projects start getting the skills and the attitude that will move you onto the projects

3) projects are also sometimes allocated by named personnel in grants.  So if person A is supported by grant A and B and C they do work on those projects.  If person X is supported by grant Y they do that one.  

4). You were told how to maximize the time when you cant do experiments.  Writing chapter for your thesis is actually important and useful because those are the foundation literature you need to know and be able to refer to, and preregistering things is always a good idea.  

5). You are not being bullied because you are not getting exactly what you want

6) You are supposed to be relatively independent at this stage, nobody should need to be finding work for you, albeit that more structured goals may have been put on hold.    If you don’t know already how to conduct the experiments technically, how to manage and anlazye them, how to do the coding that you would let you modify them, the background and limitations of those techniques, if you don’t have databases and standard protocol already written up, if you are not shadowing the other people in the lab to learn what they know how to do, it is you wasting your time, not anyone else.

7) What do you want you supervisor to do about your panic attacks ?  This is a fundamental anxiety/mental health disorder so him telling you to take some time off and deal with it by getting the therapy / support you need is absolutely appropriate.

go4hu83,TheScienceMothra,t2_86y24jcm,"Thank you for this response. I try not to buy weed, but I live in Canada and there are two dispensaries within walking distance, so self control can be difficult. I think my problem is mainly the use of it as a treat, since often times I'll convince myself to smoke early in the morning because yesterday I only smoked in the evening (which is the current dialog going through my head). I definitely use it to treat anxiety and likely depression, but I want to have a healthy, well-adjusted relationship with weed, and I wonder if that's possible. I feel like I lack the self-control required to make lasting changes. I'll succeed for a few weeks, then go right back to the normal smoking schedule. The lockdown isn't helping at all, because there's nothing to do and everything is so monotonous. Hopefully talking to someone about this can help figure out strategies to deal with the mental health problems, and it'll get easier.

As for smoking company, I agree completely. The one person I smoke weed with is my partner,  but he's been gone for 2 weeks, and my smoking has increased, not decreased as I had hoped. But I'll keep trying.

go4dop5,AwkwardAccountant5,t2_26jsf6cq,"Key advice here is you cannot compare yourself to your labmate. How she is treated and what she is doing is completely irrelevant to you. Focus on your work and what you need to get there. Treating students ""equally"" would be a disaster because students have different interests, goals, and backgrounds. For instance, I have a trainee with a medical background and one with an engineering background- both great skillsets but totally different. They are going to fit with different projects, some might be further along than others, have different skills, and need different coaching from me. 

I say this because most of your distress seems to come from comparing to this other student. First, that just doesn't matter. Second, this will bring up huge red flags in running a lab, and I've seen many students get tossed from labs for petty behavior thinking things aren't fair. There can also be tons of other things going on with this trainee that you don't know about and don't need to know about, because they just don't impact you. 

So for you- first, this is an awful time to be starting a PhD with projects on hold and all that. It is also incredibly difficult to train new people due to rules on how many in a lab and how close together. So much of this is temporary. And in any time, that first year of a PhD is tough. I've seen so many students feel like they aren't doing anything or don't know what to do, again normal. So let's focus on what you need. Are you 100% ready to hit the ground running when your study can start up? If not, those skills or organizational things (participant recruitment materials, writing code, anything else you'd need) are what you work on now. If you need training in an area, bring that up. And reading is 100% an appropriate thing to do right now! 

It doesn't sound like your PI has really done anything wrong here. But working with them on a timeline might be helpful. Or say things like ""I'd really like to get involved with X, or learn Y skill, are their any opportunities for me to do so?"" can be helpful. DO NOT SAY ""SALLY GETS TO DO THIS AND I DON""T!"" That is not a mature or effective way of handing things. Remember that your PI is also under insane stress, and they need to get whatever they can get done in these hard times done, so they are going to go with the sure bet. Do not add to their stress with interpersonal issues. And you need to show they that you are mature and can handle things. Right now there are some red flags. 

Mental health should 100% be taken seriously. Do not just blame your distress on the situation, you need to address your mental health as it relates to you before you can take anyone on.",1,2021-02-20 14:24:50,AskAcademia
e6mmfrb,Impune,t2_9juic,"&gt;I thought about management consulting but I'm not confident in my business knowledge. 

You don't need to know anything about business to go into consulting. Most the time it just requires maths and statistics applied to practical business situations. (E.g. how to improve a bottom line.) If you look at consultancy firms specializing in mental health (or healthcare in general) you might be able to become a subject matter expert or apply your skills to more specific cases as opposed to general management consulting. One such firm would be [Acasus](https://www.acasus.com).

&gt;My skills are probably more in organisation, project management, writing, neuropsychology. Anyone have any suggestions?

You could look into the [Dementia Research Council](https://mrc.ukri.org/about/mrc-jobs/). They not only employ people in the field and in general charity positions, but also have resource for careers in dementia research. It might be worth shooting them an email to see if you can set up an informal chat with someone about where else to look.

I sank into depression and I have gotten behind on my work for I'd say the past 2 years while seeing a psychologist. I am slowly getting out of it just now but I did struggle at points in my PhD time with smoking too much weed just to numb my mind to not think or feel anything, and I was an addict. My first year I would drink too everyday I came home from classes because of the intense stress, I just needed something to take the edge off and make me forget my anxiety. I really wish I had seen a mental health professional from the get go, but I didn't start seeing one until I was a year and a half in.

gnydvzl,DrunkNotThatFlexible,t2_nowpz,"If you’re open to neuro PhDs, I would argue that’s a better route. This is based on comparing my experiences as a STEM PhD to the experiences of friends (and my psychologist) who have done PhDs in clinical psych. First, clinical psych does require working as a lab manager first, and that does seem to require having an “in”. Second, clinical psych is often a 7-10 year program, but a neuro PhD is 5-6. Third, as a BIPOC researching “hard” science (neuro) you have tons of exclusive opportunities for fellowships and grants. While this may be somewhat true in all disciplines, medically-relevant “hard” science has the most funding opportunities overall. Finally, PhDs in medical colleges have higher pay and fewer outside requirements (e.g. TA ships) compared to basically all other PhDs. The drawback of a neuro PhD is that it might be harder to work on the developmental effects of growing up in a marginalized community, but you can definitely find neuro opportunities in developmental disorders or mental health.

One last thing... Department’s admissions have been affected in a variety of ways due to the pandemic. If you decide to look into neuro PhD programs, you should look around to see if any you are interested in are still allowing applications.",1,2021-02-19 01:06:09,AskAcademia
go08ogq,Monosigaovata,t2_rltyxtf,"Hi friend, 29F with similar story. Recently began therapy again for depression. Am scheduling psychological testing to determine whether there's more than just depression.

My story:
For me, prior to my mental health crisis, the stress of Research and PhD was the ""good"" stress and life was the ""bad"" stress. I liked research and usually perform well under pressure.. however, life stress confuses and scares me.. I had a bad breakup, unexpected pregnancy (was on oral birth control) and traumatic termination of that pregnancy, and then 6 months or so of catatonic depression.. I stopped sleeping, so I had no energy to exercise.. I didn't exercise so I had no appetite. I had no appetite so I didn't eat.. etc.. There was a period of 2-3 wks where I didn't shower or change clothes.. at that point alcohol was the only thing that allowed me to get calories and get sleep. But obviously the hangovers made work difficult. 

The rebound anxiety after drinking 1-2 bottles of wine in an evening was unbearable. Meltdowns in lab meeting. Talking back to my PI. Doing the same IFA staining over and over and over again because it was the only thing that made me feel like I had some control.

My depression also affected my memory. For example, I was completing my qualifying exam in the middle of this crisis and would work all day on it. Then the next day I'd sit back down at my computer and have no recollection of what I had written. It was troubling and scary. I thought I was losing my mind.

My recovery:
The most important thing for me was finally reaching out to a doctor. She put me on an antidepressant. The antidepressant doesn't make the sadness or anger go away but it does increase energy and thus gets you off the proverbial bed of sadness. For me it gave me energy to get back in the gym. Back in the gym I was able to refocus on specific physical goals. Pushing hard in the gym allowed me to eat, and made me tired enough to sleep through the night. Also being in the gym requires me to see people - I live alone and work alone due to covid. Seeing people requires showering regularly. Showering regularly makes you feel better. It sucked at the beginning but now I derive so much pleasure from getting to the gym/in the pool/out for a run. Finding pleasure in things was something I never though I'd have again.

Alcohol:
It seemed impossible at the time but im nearly 2 months sober (read: no alcohol ALONE - I have on 3 occasions had drinks WITH FRIENDS). I think back on how I felt in the midst of everything and to be perfectly honest I didn't think I'd make it this far. I don't look at my alcohol use as anything other than a last ditch survival mechanism. It really was the only thing I had to motivate me to get up, finish my work, and get out of the house. Being tipsy/drunk allowed me to have an appetite. Being drunk let me fall asleep. It was what I had. But it is addictive and the first four days or so after I drink I have strong cravings. I also smoke cigarettes so, double whammy. 

I cant tell you how I managed to be sober. I think it came down to rage. Once my antidepressant started elevating my energy I didn't need alcohol to motivate me, I had motivation on my own. Which allowed me to realize that, hey, fuck that dude who broke my heart, knocked me up, and abandoned me. I'm going to fucking tear shit up in the gym so I can beast mode my way through his skull. Or something like that. I was able to substitute my goals for my physical wellness for alcohol. But it wasn't easy. There were setbacks. I go on.

This coming Tuesday I have my work in progress for the dept. In the last two weeks, all of a sudden, I realized my mind was back. My data is actually good. My presentation is actually dynamic and interesting. Most importantly, it feels like me. My passion for my work is back. And that's a wonderful feeling after 8 months of gray.

My therapist asked me on Wednesday to write a letter to myself about how I feel now that I am sort of out of the woods. Something to read the next time I have a crisis. Something to tell myself that it's survivable. I guess this is that.

All I can say is - it NEVER feels survivable. It ALWAYS feels like the end.. In the words of Allie Brosh in her new book, ""Solutions and other problems"", the feelings we have of despair, dread, fear, etc... they feel like the end. So we lie on the ground and we feel those feelings drowning us and darkening the skies. We wait for the end to come.

But the end doesn't come. We wake up, hungover, anxious, depressed, but alive. As long as we live moment to moment, even though we are certain that the next moment brings death, we are alive. And as long as we are alive we might as well do something. And surviving is something to do.

I survived by realizing the sadness, and the anger, and even the love and the joy, that I carry with me, are the things that help me navigate the world. When I lost my love and joy, and when I even lost my anger, my sadness kept me alive. It kept me alive long enough to get my anger back. My anger kept me going long enough to feel joy again. And now that I have joy, I think love isn't far behind. I know somewhere in you is a sadness, or an anger, or a love, that is keeping you alive. And as long as you are alive, keep on surviving. &lt;3",1,2021-02-19 14:02:19,AskAcademia

I'm currently working at a pharmaceutical company in vaccine safety, but public health practice or epidemiological research are pretty common career choices after that academic path.

In terms of the pre-requisites: your background in the humanities shouldn't be a big drawback. Since epi covers a huge variety of topics and many of them are interdisciplinary, the required coursework component for my degree was way way more involved than for most other doctoral programs. It was really annoying at first, but I'm glad I was made to take all of the courses as part of my program because a) I needed the background and couldn't have gotten it any other way, and b) it's good to have exposure to all areas of the field so that even if you don't work in them, you know they're available if needed. Everyone in my year had very diverse academic backgrounds. For context, I have an undergrad in psychology and a masters of math in computer science. 

In terms of your health: the nice thing about epi is that people in the field tend to be very accommodating about health issues and barriers to access, because that's our whole jam. I think it would be very tractable to do a career in the field (either hands on, or more research-based) with impaired vision. You wouldn't be expected to do physical experiments as with biology or chemistry, and there are a lot of tools to accommodate vision impairments when working with computers. I don't have impaired vision so I can't comment on that specifically, but I had to drop half of my courses in the first term of my degree because of mental health issues. The administration was very willing to work with me to accommodate my illness so I could graduate on time.

I know it can seem hardest to continue when you're ""closest to the shore,"" so to speak, but if there's any chance at all you can finish, you should. Also, they're right that grad school is extremely stressful. You're going to be tired, stressed, anxious, and you're going to have family emergencies and losses that you'll have to power through, so if you can make it through this, it might be a good indicator of what you can make it through then.

f6rhor6,Gemini725,t2_3u2gyd0n,"&gt; You **must** relocate in order to pursue graduate studies (since you've been black-booked by the only uni in your area). 

I don't know that I""ve been ""black-booked"" by the university (or if that would even be legal for them to do). I think I'd be depressed and distracted by the absence of my former professor, and the overall environment would be awkward (i.e. running into or having to interact with the chair), but if I'm an otherwise strong candidate (and this time I won't devote my entire statement of purpose to a retiring professor), they couldn't discriminate or retaliate against me. The question is whether it's worth immersing myself in that environment. Ironically, being in graduate school would mean having better access to mental health services (i.e student health insurance, income from a T.A. or R.A. position etc.). Plus, having a supportive cohort may offset some of these issues with the faculty. Even if it's not the ""ideal"" environment, it's not like I would be living with these faculty members. Once classes, meetings, etc. are over, I can leave it behind (and still be in this city). 

&gt; it'll be impossible to avoid absolutely *all* flights during your career, 

I understand that I'll probably have to travel at  some point, but is frequent (or long distance/international) travel a requirement? Even though it's enriching/beneficial to meet others in your field, are these trips a requirement in the sense that teaching a certain number of hours is, etc.? I was also thinking more along the lines of grad. school (even at the master's level). If an advisor suggests that you present at a certain conference, can you decline (or request to only attend local ones?) They may think it's weird, but would most be willing to continue working with you? 

&gt; believing an A- paper was bad 

I wish this was a case of anxiety/neurosis, but the professor implied in her feedback that the grade was generously given. Besides saying that I earned ""28/30 points-*a very good result* (emphasis mine), her general comments were that it had a ""clear thesis"" (not a brilliant or creative one, etc. \[though she did refer to it as ""good"" in the comments within the paper itself\]), was ""organized coherently"" (not ""very well organized""), and that ""if I wanted to do anything more with it in the future, I would have to ""correct the numerous spelling and other common errors throughout."" (Again, I could barely concentrate while writing it, but she didn't know that.) Based on this feedback, it was, at best, a mediocre paper. (I'll probably create a separate post for it.)

Either way, I don't have the reference from  her. (Though had the paper turned out better, I wouldn't have even submitted the proposal and none of the subsequent events would have happened.) In most cases, this could be solved by signing up for another course and proving that I could produce better work. However, I can't afford to do that. (Then there's the added stress of negativity within the dept., but on second thought, maybe this would be a good way to build a rapport with a new professor.) 

&gt; You're not allowed to cancel just because someone is sniffing. If you insisted on doing this, you would likely be fired. 

I wouldn't cancel the entire class because someone sniffled. I plan on keeping a box of sterile masks in the class (and this  goes for any educational position I have, T.A. or even teaching high school in the meantime etc.), and if someone sneezed, coughed more than once, sniffled, etc., I'd ask them to wear a mask. (If they refused, then I'd ask them to leave.) However, if someone comes in exhibiting full-blown flu or cold symptoms, then I would want them to leave. They are disrupting the class by risking getting others sick, plus there might be other students with anxiety about it. 

With that said, I'm going to consider this feedback. If it was an easy decision, I wouldn't be posting about it. I'm torn between loving my field/research, not really seeing myself in a more ""traditional job"" (I was self employed before attending college) ,and knowing how incompatible academia may be with my anxiety.",1,2019-11-07 05:26:43,AskAcademia

Tips for finding a good masters program: pick a lab based on where you feel welcome and happy.

f6ww6ds,lucianbelew,t2_cvg6r,"&gt; Interestingly, when I brought up my concerns about students coming to class sick, one of the reasons given as to why I couldn't throw them out is that it would be akin to throwing out a student for having a disability. Someone even commented that they have to be allowed to come to class sick because, with their disability, they would miss too much classtime otherwise. So, doesn't the same logic apply to a mental health disability?

Seeing as I never made that argument, I wouldn't know.  I do know that the ADA requires schools to make **reasonable** accommodations for disabilities.  Knowingly exposing the faculty, students and staff to a person known to be volatile, vindictive and unhinged is not, in any way, a reasonable accommodation.



&gt; Can a grad. program reject a student because they have a known mental health disability that may affect their work and/or conduct (by definition a mental illness will affect at least one of the two). 

Not sure, but they **can** reject an applicant based on a lack of confidence that said applicant will be a good, functional member of the department.  Would you say that you've created a good case for you as a good, functional member of the department?   (Warning - this isn't one of those 'there are no wrong answers' type situations.)

&gt; I disagree that even a student without mental health issues should be rejected because they filed a complaint (and felt guilty and tried to rescind it yet)

You seem to be under the impression that some applicants (such as yourself) are entitled to positions within programs, and can only have their applications rejected if certain disqualifying criteria are met.  This has no correlation whatsoever with the truth.  It is up to the applicant to make the case that they would be a positive addition to the program.  Would you say that you have done this?  (Warning - this isn't one of those 'there are no wrong answers' type situations.)

&gt; but when mental health is involved, doesn't it become discrimination against a disability?

Only if it's a recognized disability, with documentation, where the disabled student has made a reasonable effort to mitigate the disability's impact on their own experience, and reasonable accommodation by the institution can get you the rest of the way there.  By analogy, if your disability were that you had lost the use of your legs, you would have had to avail yourself of readily available assistive technologies (such as a wheelchair) and made the school aware of further needs (such as housing with universal access to facilities and classes that don't require navigating staircases) before they became a crisis.  Translating your situation to this analogy, you, instead, refused to try and find a wheelchair that works for you because the first one you tried didn't fit your body, then threw yourself down the stairs, wallowed in your own waste for a while, and threatened to sue the school when they acted as though this was not a problem of their own making.  See the difference?  (Warning - this isn't one of those 'there are no wrong answers' type situations.)

&gt; Regardless, this department doesn't seem to be a good fit for me, 

You're so close to figuring this out.  **You** are not a good fit for further academic work until you get your personal life sorted out.  You will also have an extremely difficult time ever achieving admission into a program anywhere, as no reference from your undergraduate institution will do anything but warn the admissions committee to reject your application out of hand.

&gt; but not wanting to move, this university is my only choice. (And even if moving is required for academia, I cold at least strive for a master's degree and then decide if I want to further pursue the academic career path.)

Find another path now.  The sooner you start working on that, the sooner you can get somewhere that makes you happy.",1,2019-11-08 18:04:14,AskAcademia
f6vyt9a,NoxiousQuadrumvirate,t2_kywisro,"&gt;but when mental health is involved, doesn't it become discrimination against a disability?

**NO**.

If someone has a mental health disability that results in them having explosive anger issues, even if they're not violent or damaging anything, that's still a very good reason not to hire them. Their behaviour when angry and the way they blow up at minor infractions would alienate their colleagues, make them difficult to work with (having to ""walk on eggshells""), and overall destroy the collegiate atmosphere of the workplace. People wouldn't want to work with them, talk to them, even be in the same room as them. Students would feel uncomfortable and be subjected to unfair stress in managing their lecturer's mental illness as they would have to change their behaviour in **unreasonable** ways. 

The university would not be required or even expected to hire that person. Their disability affects *others* in very negative ways, and all accommodations that can be made are similarly unreasonable. 

You will not be accepted or hired because your disability currently makes you unfit to work. You have reasons for the way you behaved but they are not excuses, you are not excused, you are not forgiven, and these beliefs/behaviours will not be tolerated. There is no meeting you half-way on this. Your expectations are unreasonable and no one will even attempt to meet them.

I did have professors, both in undergrad and grad school, who were wonderful about understanding when I needed to put a pin in discussions (my anxiety manifested in splitting headaches and nausea that would come on suddenly, sometimes necessitating cutting meetings short).

That said, obviously, it is not a great idea to barge into a crowded room and shout at the top of your lungs ""I am coping with mental health issues! This is a difficult thing and is occasionally a serious struggle for me!"" is necessarily a great idea. On the other hand, knowing that it *is* possible to have a mature, healthy, and productive discussion about such topics with one's advisor is great.  

When I was working on my Master's degree, my advisor virtually never gave me any meaningful feedback. My self-doubt absolutely terrorized me, and it took the better part of two years until I felt comfortable with the work I was doing. Looking back, it could have been much better had I spoke up after a few months and just told him, ""Hey. I am not managing to get a sense of how well/poorly I am doing from the feedback you have been giving me, and this is making me worry--perhaps irrationally?--that I am standing on thin ice with you. Do you think anything can be done about this going forward?"", then I would have spared myself a year of daily stress. At some point it got so bad that I was having (thankfully very mild) anxiety attacks once or twice per week, and was seriously considering taking a semester off for health reasons.

My advisor didn't even know I was stressing so much. When we had a concluding discussion after I successfully finished the degree, he told me he was always happy with my work. In retrospect, the reality is that he was still new to being a professor, I was among his first students, and, by my understanding, he was so concerned that his feedback would be mistaken to be unnecessarily harsh that he tried to say as little as possible.  

I suffered for no reason, because I was too scared or embarrassed to speak up.  

One final thing. Although I do not openly announce my mental health history, I try to keep an atmosphere that encourages people to speak up if it seems necessary. And if they speak up, I let them know I also have firsthand experience. I no longer keep my personal struggles like some closely-held secret -- and in my experience so far, this also helps other people open up.

ernu0xz,Veec,t2_gqfjk,"A little background: I didn't go to uni till I was 24, but I really found it was 'my kinda thing'. I won award after award throughout my undergrad, won a scholarship to do my MA, received an unconditional offer for a PhD with a supervisor I respected to do a project I was passionate about. However, about 3 months before I found out I got a scholarship to do my PhD (it was 16k annual, so barely enough to live on, much less save and buy a house on), I was headhunted by an international company who offered me twice the scholarship and amazing benefits. I obviously took the job as I hadn't been sure I'd get the scholarship, and when I got the offer I agonised over the decision but I ended up turning it down as ultimately I felt it was the more responsible thing to do. Keeping the job with all its benefits was the 'safe bet', even though I feared I'd regret it.

It's been a few years now and I never have. Not once.

Everyone is different though, so here's what you need to think about. Will doing this PhD genuinely benefit your career and life? 

I know so many students who did a PhD cause they liked the lifestyle of academia and they had no plan-B outside of academia. Some did it just cause they were passionate about their subject and didn't want to let it out of their lives yet, and that's a valid reason for some people, but if you're in a precarious monetary position (and given how much uni in the US costs), is it the best option for you? I would only ever recommend doing a PhD to someone (who isn't independently wealthy) if they feel the net benefit outweighs the many, many, many serious costs to your time, mental health, physical health, and career aspirations (you will be 4 years behind people who went straight into the work force). 

I have never regretted 'leaving academia' and going private, but I was studying DH and ended up in IT, so I still do similar to things to what I did before, I still attend conferences, and I still am active in my former area of research as a hobby. I got the best of both worlds. Our situations may not line up, but hopefully it'll give you something to think about and let you know there is a happy path out there for you.

I wonder if perhaps something similar happened here? Regardless, treat this as a learning experience, including how to more carefully ensure that you are not accidentally using quotes without attribution in the future.

Get into mental hospital ain't that easy either.

f6m8l09,HumanDrinkingTea,t2_o4xhq,"For some background, I have a music degree and am now a STEM major. While music isn't quite theatre, it does have some similarities to theatre that makethem both distinct from STEM majors. I have also worked in the professional world as a musician. 

Here's the thing: I agree with others that he was unnecessarily harsh. However, he likely *was* saying something that you really needed to hear, and chances are that he just didn't know how to say it in a way that wasn't harsh.

&gt;  he pointed out at the time that he knew he was being aggressive but he was just trying to help make sure I didn't make a mistake with my life or something like that

I went to a fairly competitive music school. This school also had a theatre and musical theatre department that were among the top programs in the country. Doing what you did would have been an automatic F in any of the performance-based classes in any of these majors at my school, in absence of official documentation from the school's disabilities office (note that this is a different office than the counseling office). Here's the thing:

&gt;  I had to go my school's counselling services before the class, and it ran through the class, so I missed it.

It sounds like you could have looked at your watch, interrupted your therapist, and said ""got to go, bye."" He doesn't know you were having a mental health crisis-- he can *only* know this if he gets official documentation from the disability office, and it does not sound like you did this. Absent of this knowledge, he expects you to drop what you're doing and run to class if you need to, because that is the professional standard in the performing arts fields. 

Sure, your class didn't have these ""automatic F"" policies, but he surely knows that other schools do. The reason that other schools do is because in the professional world, if you miss a single performance or rehearsal and don't hire a sub, you are blacklisted-- you will never get work again. Getting an F in a college class is a lot less harsh than the ""real world"" ramifications of not showing up. Other people rely on you being there. 

It is hard to overemphasize how important showing up is in the performing arts is. Your professor was trying to communicate to you how incredibly unacceptable it is to miss a performance-based class. Just because you're not ""interested"" in acting isn't an excuse. You are on the books as a theatre major, so you will be held to the standards of a theatre major. 

The culture of STEM is very, *very* different. It was a shock to me when I changed fields. You have to be mindful of this and realize that you cannot assume that something that is acceptable in STEM classes is acceptable in theatre classes, or vice-versa. 

The bottom line is that your professor was speaking from years of experience and was seriously concerned about your future. It was honestly a kindness for him to have a talk with you, because he probably see's many, many students screw their futures with flakiness. Not saying that you were flaky-- it sounds like you were having legitimate issues, but the professor didn't know that at the time, so he had every reason to believe that you were being irresponsible. Again, just *being* at the counseling office isn't an excuse-- the proper department to go through if you're missing class for health reasons is the school's disability services. 

&gt;  I think he thought I was okay with it.

He knew you weren't okay with it, but sometimes people need to be told things they don't want to hear. Moral of the story? Do everything within your power to avoid missing theatre classes. Now that your mental health issues are diagnosed, you can go through disability services and have that open dialogue with your professors. 

Many students, unfortunately, are straight up delusional about their chances of success. If you aren't at a school that is competitive, then this may be a problem at your school. With your STEM major, it is not something you should worry about, but your professor is probably tired of seeing students graduate in debt with no career prospects. Your professor is telling you things he knows you don't want to hear, because he thinks that it will help you make better decisions in the future. 

What your professor lacks is proper communication skills, most likely. You should, however, consider that there is a legitimate reason that your professor chose to act like he did. Sure, he was a jerk about it. But that doesn't mean he did to *be* a jerk. It really sounds like he did it to give you a dose of reality. 

Here's how he *should* have communicated his concerns:

&gt; I want you to succeed in the future, and I want you to be the best ""you"" that you can possibly be. Unfortunately, your attendance and performance this semester have been subpar, and if this trend continues, I fear that you will struggle in this profession. What can we do to address this problem?

Notice that this communicates the same ideas he was trying to get across, but in a non-asshole way.

I would suggest that he talk to a mental health professional, perhaps at the school clinic, and try to sort out what's going on.

This was not true during coursework, but ever since passing my quals I’ve been able to manage my own schedule (besides teaching), which means I can work pretty efficiently because everything is scheduled and planned according to what I know works best for me (which I recognize is not a luxury other people will have, depending on their family commitments or field).

I use Hello Fresh for three dinners a week and do pick up for my other groceries, so spend little time grocery shopping. I do my laundry every Friday night before bed and let the dryer run while I sleep, so I never get overwhelmed with laundry and only have to spend 15 minutes folding it on Saturday. I get drinks with friends every few weeks and we usually spend a fair amount of that time talking about our work (much to my partner’s chagrin), so I consider my social life to be semi-productive in its own right.

Just to clarify - As a prospective applicant to a US PhD program, you are generally required to contact PIs prior to applying. This way you know who has funding for incoming students, and the type of projects the PI is anticipating to work on for the next ~5 years. You then are interviewed by these PIs prior to admission. Maybe it's different for different departments, but this is pretty much the standard in biomedical PhD programs.

Otherwise I do agree the mental health and work life balance for graduate students seems to be generally a lot better in Europe vs the US.

In short: I don't work 11-13 hours consistently. I can't. My mental health is worth more than that. 

I work 8-9 hours/ day and occasionally (once /month or so ) go til 12 hours. This gives you time. Remember while you are getting degree you are also living your life. I also don't have a pet and slack on cleaning more than I should but this doesn't seem to be a function of free time. I call my parents/friends on my walk to/from work which is about 10-15 min. My PhD program is flexible and I make my own hours so leaving for appointments isn't really an issue as long as I'm still productive. 

I am also sensitive to when I am and am not being productive and work to maximize those hours. For example 8am - 1pm I am good at writing and can focus where as in the afternoon is better for monotonous lab work. I mainly meal prep so cook 1-2 times a week and put it tupperware but when my SO lived nearby we cooked a lot. 

Also. This is 4-5 years of my life. If I can't make time to myself as a non married no kids  PhD student, how will I in the future as hopefully a new faculty / parent. Its all about time management and making lists and not wasting time. Sure it ebs and flows but I generally don't go above 50 hours a week including course work. 

In my lab, with my PI, we are pretty independent and have group meetings but are otherwise not micromanaged at all which lets me/ my labmates work when/where we are most productive.

1. You don't apply and you don't get accepted. Cost: giving up your dreams and more? Benefit: you can't get rejected; you don't spend any money, time, or effort applying.
2. You apply and get rejected. Cost: any money, time, and effort expended in applying; disappointment at rejection. Benefit: maybe that you'll have fewer regrets later in life?
3. You apply and get accepted. Cost: money, time, and effort spent applying. And all the trials and tribulations of graduate school, which many consider an ordeal. Benefit: you'll get to go to graduate school, which many consider a great opportunity.

You say that you're OK with rejection, so looking at this list, I think it's obvious that the worst possible outcome comes from not applying.

Thank you for all of your concern and advice! 

Advice on role of professors and mental health help: 
It's very late in the semester, and I didn't really understand how to get help from the school until recently. I reached out to the Director of Relationship and Sexual violence and was able to set up accommodations with my professors reducing the need to include personal details of my situation. My professors have been understanding, and I mainly talk to them about accommodations related to coursework. 

Advice on graduation:
I'd like to graduate on time. I think the worst case scenario is if I have to repeat my semester next year. It would just save a lot of tuition money to finish on time. I will set up a meeting with the Dean of Undergraduate Affairs to see what my options are. 

I have an action plan that I'm following. I'm more so looking for advice on the bigger picture I think? Or the thoughts and personal anecdotes of academics on the controversial issues I listed. I guess I’m just feeling lost. I know I’ll graduate and I’ll be successful in the future, but I feel so confused about everything like:
Should I use performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive edge this semester? 
Did you struggle with mental health and what did you personally do?
How did taking a break affect your view on careers in academia? 
What unhealthy coping mechanisms did you develop during your profession? 

It helps a lot to know that this isn’t uncommon. I also get motivation from reading stories that address those issues.

Yep-- SLAC. I of course taught at an R1 as a grad student, so am familiar with the 400-600+ student classes...which is why I pursued a career at an SLAC. The largest classes we have on campus are into bio and psych lectures, and they are capped at 30. Labs at capped at 15. I teach a lot of classes with 10-15 students, and never over 25.

It's indeed a different model, and while I (obiously) think it's better, I also realize that it's very expensives and doesn't scale well.

And fear about it, too: use it? Don't use it? What might happen?

Would it help you to look at the fellowship as a tool? A tool that would help you complete your PhD with less financial worry, and also a boost to your CV? A tool someone gave you based on your achievements? A tool that you are free to discard and not use if it won't help you reach your goal?

2) You're a co-author on multiple papers and have relevant research experience.

3) Read up on ""Imposter syndrome"". You gotst it. 

You wouldn't be getting received well by faculty if they didn't think you were a good fit. If your grades are good enough for you to get into a graduate program (which they are, because you've already been through a master's degree), most professors don't really care about undergrad grades as long as you meet minimum admission requirements. If it requires the GRE for admissions, you may have to retake if you don't meet the minimum, but again, once an application gets to the professor's desk, that's likely not a deal breaker unless he's looking at multiple, otherwise near-identical applicants.

4) Are you getting on-going help for mental health issues? Suicide attempts are not typical responses to rejection, as much as rejection sucks (and graduate student suicides are still very much a problem, at least in the US, not sure about elsewhere). Your life is more important than a PhD, and grad school. Even once you get into a program and even if you're doing really well, there will be a lot of rejection (critical advisors, rejected papers, poorly received conference presentations.... ). None of that necessarily means you're doing poorly in your program, but it's hard to see beyond those negatives.  Just about everyone I know (myself included) has had their mental health take hits during grad programs, including a few who have had to take leaves of absence to recalibrate and get their health back in order. With your history--while not a red flag for a program application--make sure you're able to get the resources you need through campus from the start, so you can thrive in your program.

5) Just repeating #4. Make sure you're getting the help you need and will be able to continue getting it if you get into a program.

&amp;#x200B;

First and foremost, take care of your mental health. This is the priority. Job, school, whatever, none of that is going to really truly take off unless you taking care of yourself first. 

Don't be afraid to speak up if meds aren't working, or are making you think fucked up shit; dosages/prescriptions need to be altered all the time. It's commonplace so be 100% honest with your psychiatrist about that. But just don't stop at meds...find a therapist you're comfortable with and go as regularly as you can or insurance allows. Mental health is your priority.

&amp;#x200B;

With that said, depending on your career goals, in order to really make decent (subjective I know but pretty much enoguh to sustain yourself comfortably) money, you NEED at least a masters in the Psych field. So if you want to stay in the field, graduate school is the next step. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, your mental health can affect school like it currently is doing, and may affect your job. In my experience, if you're going into social services, which is typical for the field if you just got your undergrad degree, you're going to be put in very stressful situations and may not have the best work-life balance. So that might increase the depression and usher in other things if your MH isn't prioritized. But for many, grad school is stressful as hell too.

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever you decide, make you sure you know the job and the degree are not worth you neglecting yourself. Clinicial depression is a nasty beast, but you can overcome it if you have a good support system and make sure you put your health above all.

&gt;How many hours do you work on average per week/day?

Outside of class (I teach a 3/3 load which comes out to about 10 hrs/week of contact hours not including office hours) I spend about 1-2 hrs of prep for all three classes, and 1-2 hrs of admin/light grading (online posts, short homework, etc) about 3-4 days/week.

I teach mostly just language, and keep in mind that I've been doing that for many decades, so I don't need much language prep. Aside from photocopying, I could probably get away with just walking into a classroom and winging it. This was obviously NOT the case when I started as a grad student - I was spending up to 3 hrs/class for prep.

If I teach a lit course, it requires significantly more prep work. Every time you teach a repeat it gets easier of course. New courses take about 2-4 hrs/class day of prep work instead of  30-34 minutes.

&gt;What is your favorite part of being a foreign language professor? What is your least favorite part?

I have to echo what others are saying - 11-13 hour workdays are excessive. Of course, there are always times you'll have to work long hours, but consistently working that much will lead to a very real burnout. 
Realistically I work 8-10 hour days regularly. Balancing life and grad school is always a challenge, but it is absolutely possible. I changed my schedule around a lot until I found a system that worked for me, for example, I get up early and go to the gym. This way I get my workout in (which is also key for managing my mental health!) and then I'm far more productive when I get to lab since I've been up for hours. Because of that, I can usually finish all my wet lab work and most computer work at a reasonable time.
Get home, make dinner, relax. Taking this time to unwind from the day is just as important as working; it will increase your productivity and keep you from burning out. 
As far as errands and what not go, take them in chunks. Car maintenance can often be done on the weekend, so set aside a Saturday morning and go get it done. I'm fairly lucky that I work in a lab that's independent and laid-back, so if I have to run to the bank in the middle of the day, no one cares. If you cannot do this, go during lunch. 
As for grocery shopping, we take advantage of the online ordering and pickup services, like from Walmart, where pickup is free. Not only do we save money from not perusing every aisle and buying on a whim, but we also only spend 30 minutes running to pick up our groceries vs hours otherwise. 

But honestly, take a moment to re-evaluate working 11-13 hour days. This is excessive, regardless of the reason. Making time to do other things in life is essential, and there's no reason to be working so much (unless, as others have stated it's a toxic environment).",1,2019-03-22 19:06:49,AskAcademia

As far as oversharing, I would say it depends. If the question is about adversity and the basis for your adversity was your mental health (preferably something clearly identifiable) then it seems to me it would make sense. But if it's more of a result of a hard situation, then that might be more oversharing. For example, if the adversity you faced was your dad dying and you struggled with mental health after that, that may be not be the best approach. That's sharing your inner emotions in a place that's not really the best for it. 

But if the issue were, for example, ADHD, and you trained yourself in techniques to overcome that difficulty and get medication, etc. Then that would be appropriate. 

The second would demonstrate a good ability to overcome adversity and not overshare something too personal, while the first, even if there was more to the story and you got through it, would not show that as much and would be a very personal thing.

I hope you do this knowing that there is a cultural difference between first generation, international, and minority students on the one hand and other students in the other, where talking to an authority figure is seen as an admission of failure and weakness.

Not everyone has the means to go to a psychiatrist, get documentation, go to the deans, get documentation, so they can come to you to get a 24-hour extension.

You are covering your back and doing what you need to do so your ducks are in a row for administration, with 0 thought given to the student.

When this happens, I do my best to accommodate through giving extensions on deadlines or allowing make-up exams. But actually intervening in a student's mental health is something that most faculty would be strongly discouraged from doing.

\- you failed once before. How much % of the students failed the course?  
\- you show no interest during the class: no participation, no notetaking. How do you take notes in a textbook? A lot of things a professor says are not in the textbook. If you do not write things down during the lecture, you are missing out on useful stuff for context.   
\- he asked you what was going on and offered help. You did not want it: you continued your behaviour of passively attending the course. In a music subject, that is quite problematic. You need to actively exercice and doing the exercices during class is different than doing them at home as you will get quicker feedback and train to think fast.  
\- he made a joke about you moving forward. That is hardly offensive.   
\- You missed classes and you did not apologise for it. Simply sending an email would have been a nice thing. Also: 3 classes is quite a lot.   
\- Your whole behaviour was appalling and you are blaming a professor for getting pissed of with you.   
\- you missed classes (it's not the professor's obligation to accomodate you, if you live to far, you need to find a room nearby your Uni). You can also say that you might arrive later due to commuting but you should not blame other people for your problem. 

Pretty sure that if you return to his class, he will help you but you will have to be upfront about your issues. People without mental health issues can deal with confrontations, that is part of life. You have a mental health problem tah impedes you from doing so. That is not his fault.   


From personal experience: A girl in my class had a similar issue and the teacher, who always wanted to help students, got angry with her attitude.

We have some very strict guidelines on what we can and cannot say/do, due to liability concerns. Plus, I know from firsthand experience that sometimes the students struggling the most are also the most skilled at hiding it, so they won't necessarily trip any notice.

So I'm proactive. During that first class of the semester, where we go over the syllabus, class policy, university policy, and all of that, I also add in a spiel about campus resources. I include tutoring, the writing center, the health center, and mental health/counseling resources. I don't make a huge deal of it, but I treat it like other ""things that might come up and derail your success, here's some resources that will help."" My campus also has a secondary office that specifically helps students who need extended accommodations that aren't ""disability"" per se - things like extended absences for health reasons - but most students never hear about it unless they go digging; I make sure that's on the list too.

I teach in a creative field, so we're a little more informal and have smaller classes, which makes it easier for me to try to help students without formally ""intervening."" I use the 20 minutes or so while students are trickling in to strike up conversations about whatever - movies, the football game, the weird protest we had to walk by in the quad - and get to know students as people. I also often kick off class with something interesting but unrelated, so that stragglers can get in before the bulk of teaching. It's usually an article or video about our industry, or some parody clip, but once or twice per semester, I include some sort of ""college advice"" article that's not dumb or cheesy.

ej8fgmh,HeWhoDragsYou,t2_10iq28,"Immediate and short answer: in my experience, academics do very little outside of their immediate purview when confronted with information about students' mental health. 

1. Mental health requires balance. I have literally had professors tell me that they understand that we have pther classes, but they need 100% effort in their class because it is hard/important/theirs/enter reason here. It may be, it may be not, but if you go about producing your course with the assumptions that your class is allowed to be disproportionately hard, you are directly impinging on a student's work-life balance. 

2. Equity vs. equality in class policies. ""I know that you have an emotional disorder that develops in a particular set of personal, familial, and societal circumstances, but my giving you an extension on this paper is unfair to your fellow students that do not have to work two jobs to make ends meet so that they can come to class, because they do not have depression and they do not get this perk. Of course, their tutor may be writing their papers while you come with medical documentation, but that's none of my business coz I don't see it.""

3. Who do you think comprises all the committees that get to decide where funds are allocated? Some of them are not professors but administrators, but the vast majority of them are professors. It is freaking fantastic that the clinical psychologist and the biologist in the committee advocate for more mental health funds, but the CS and economist in the Ron believe that that shit is slow flakey millennials that just complain. The votes of three two groups are worth the same, even though one group includes topic specialists and the other one includes somewhat informed laymen. Sorry to anyone offended here: I don't go to my accountant to get my physical so I don't understand why professors with no applicable specialties get to share non-professional opinions in the same consequential way that specialists do.

4. Connected to #3. What do you think is the age breakdown in academia currently? Judging from age alone, are they more likely to be holistic thinkers that privilege a balanced approach to learning and living, or dogmatic thinkers that think trigger warnings are the death of the American Strength of Character?

5. Connected to 4. When some of these professors went to college, there were 4 journals published, filed neatly in one library of the campus, and you had to read one of the 5 applicable articles for that one literature review, and you'd be in fine shape! After all,  there are fields that are so extremely new that they may not have existed when the people that teach them now went to school. However, your literature review needs to include searches in all major databases, you have ILL services available in case you cannot find one or ten articles, so God forbid you show up to my class with NINE and NOT TEN articles. Like what the fuck were you doing yesterday? Finding another 10 articles for that other class that has the same exact request, coz you should give 100% on that too? I don't see that class, so I don't care. 

7. ""I know it's midterm season, but we have this major opportunity to visit X hospital and see Y machine! Anyone that can make it tomorrow night gets extra credit, I couldn't do it any other day coz I am going ot of town this weekend for the Superbowl and next weekend for Rupaul's Drag Race live finale. So all of y'all that don't have jobs, classes, or other papers that you may be running late on, you get extra credit so I can look good with the department about my class activities and my 'experiential' learning; the rest of you, good luck.""

The problems with professors and their relationship to mental health is that they see themselves as divorced from conversations about what causes it. They see themselves as specialists that are there to do one thing - teach - and other things fall outside of their scope of work. They fail to understand their role in one's college experience because somehow they are not part of the societal pressures or societal support systems that make one more or less likely of developing a mental health diagnosis. Professors are not to blame for their students' inherent predisposition to develop mental health issues, but they are central, direct figures in one's life during a tremendously challenging developmental time. 

Because somehow, it is *others* that determine the salary of graduate assistants, the amount of reading one has to do, how early in the morning a class meets, how late at night a class meets, what the tardiness policy is, what is an acceptable time to change readings, what is an appropriate level of detail to ask re: materials that you cannot apply without a terminal degree. I mean seriously, does an undergraduate student in clinical psychology need to know what the difference should be in durations of depressive symptoms so that a diagnosis is for major depressive disorder and not pervasive depressive disorder or bereavement? There is no fucking way an undergraduate in psychology is going to ever need to use that knowledge without getting at least another graduate degree, at which point, it will be their future professor to stress them out about something that is central to their chosen career, and not a major requirement. 

But lo and behold. Ask professors about what we can do about student mental health, and the answer is thoughts and prayers. It is a rare individual that will say, I try to direct them as applicable, but this is really not my field. We know it's not your field henny, and nobody is asking you to become a psychiatrist overnight. I really don't know what kind of monumental event needs to happen to show people that they are not just teaching one subject and one class, but contributing - directly or tacitly - to a climate that insists on pushing people to not sleep and eat in a rush while they are away from their families for their first time in forever, while they also get exposed to alcohol, drugs, and sex for the first time becauss Puritan America insists on the drinking age being 21 and abstinence-only programs to educate on sex and drugs.

&gt;Then I hid behind a wall so none of my classmates would see me, **cried and had a panic attack for about 1.5 hours, and seriously considered committing suicide.**

&gt;I wasted her time, I blew it, I take full responsibility for my actions, and I'll accept any consequences without question.

I don't expect her to continue being my advisor, and I expect my reputation at this uni to be irreparably ruined. I may have to withdraw from school and leave academia altogether because the shame is too much to bear. I don't know how I can show up at her office next week, say sorry again, and ask for forgiveness even though I don't deserve it.

&gt;I don't want to tell her about my mental health issues because I know there's no (public) crying in academia and I'm a 20-year-old adult who needs to suck it up like everyone else. It would be disrespectful of me to burden others – especially those ranked significantly above me – with my own problems. A year ago, the professor for whom I work managed to figure out that I'm mentally ill without my explicit disclosure, and I'm ashamed of myself every time I see him, so I don't want anyone else to know.

&gt;I'm an **undergraduate junior**

Jesus fucking Christ tell me you're trolling. You HAVE to take care of yourself whether or not you'll have to pay for a therapist. You can't be successful (nobody will give a rat's ass about your GPA if you can't be healthy and deal socially with people) if you're not healthy.

You're an undergraduate JUNIOR on top of it. And you're panicking for a 20-minute chat you missed with an academic advisor?

It's not as though it was a one hour appointment or a serious meeting. You don't do much in 20 minutes. Plus, this person is a human being, not a king or some sort of all-powerful master who has the power to put the final stamp on your degree.

Do you want to stay in academia? Then get your shit together by dealing with **LESS** workload and **SLEEP FUCKING MORE** (take camomile, I can even give you some names of really strong ones), and **SEE A THERAPIST**.

I'm using bold and capital letters so hopefully it gets through your head.

If it does not move beyond this I don't think it's worth complaining. I'm sure the quiz is set up in such a way that everyone get an area of weakness no matter what. I think the quiz is a result of sloppy work pulling together course materials more than anything else.

A bigger issue is the lack of scientific validity of this quiz.


The 2nd assignment you mentioned does sounds kind of invasive. A lot of the questions are personal, not just the religious ones. It's one thing to assign the quiz to get people thinking about what wellness is as a concept and whether they agree or disagree with how the quiz operationalizes it, but an assignment asking you to discuss the personal topics in the quiz is asking a lot. 

I think there are a couple of ways to approach this without compromising your opinions:

1) Operationalize spiritual in a way that you are okay with. For example, I'm an atheist but maybe I could decide that spirituality is really about self care and mental wellbeing. Does not matter if this is what the quiz meant, but you you easily make an argument that this is spiritual health and talk about how you'll take time to relax and balance work with fun to avoid stress. etc etc

2) You could use the worksheet to argue about why you disagree with this need.

I think 1 is the better choice. Pick a definition of spiritual that works for you and go with that. 

I think this assignment really is about poor planning on the profs part probably based on materials from the textbook company that were not carefully reviewed. If this is the only incident of this nature in the course I don't think it's worth escalating. If other things happen then escalate, but this one incident may be a misunderstanding.

Without knowing the details of your situation (and I don't want to know, you shouldn't post them here!), I do believe that you should probably keep looking for a doctor. Here's the issue, you were not diagnosed until college, and you haven't really stabilized. Most kids are diagnosed much earlier, which means makes me suspicious. Either you're doctors weren't on top of things or your case is unusual. Either way, you haven't had the opportunity to learn how to deal with your illness.

I see parent after parent struggle with the same problems, but my daughter's outcome has been generally very good for two reasons.

My husband has also gone to this doctor, and though he is 33 he realized that the half dozen doctors he has seen previously were ignoring some really important issues.

My concern is that you may be having some bad luck here. That you are not getting a program together that will help you succeed.

Do ***not*** pursue a second BA. **The vast majority of universities don't even allow this.** It's also a waste of two precious resources: time and money.

When you apply to Master's programs, apply widely and plan on applying at least twice. Make sure your statement of purpose is clear, concise, and compelling. Your narrative should explain the *specific* reasons driving you to make this transition. You can also make yourself stand out if you can **frame your anthropological background as a benefit, rather than as a lack.**

In other words: while your statement should foreground your familiarity with the field of psychology, you can also explain how this other area of expertise will uniquely inform you as a researcher/mental health professional. (But also make it clear that you understand there are massive differences between these two fields.)

**And if you haven't familiarized yourself with psychology in your spare time, then take a year to do just that.** Read some canonical and contemporary research in the subfields that interest you. Take (not for credit) online courses on Coursera or EdX. Reach out to a psych. professor from your undergrad/grad institution and see if they might be open to a *short* conversation with you about pursuing the PsyD. 

If haven't been doing this already, you should reconsider whether this is the right path for you.

gjgnwsu,illmaticrabbit,t2_lafs7,"My take is that the work/life balance problems of PhD students and STEM academics in general mostly stem from the narrow way that scientists are evaluated. In general, “high-impact” publications and grants (which you’re more likely to get if you have publications in top journals) are the keys to job security and success. 

But getting published in top journals is not a fair game. You have to have consistent positive results and there is a level of flat-out luck involved. Papers in top journals require a huge amount of data and usually they are worked on by 10+ members of a large lab (but only 1 or maybe 2 people will get the first author position). Sometimes you have to spend time setting up equipment or troubleshooting things- activities which you can’t write about in a paper and thus people joining labs that have already established in-demand methods have a big advantage. There is also a bias towards certain (often expensive) methods that you may or may not be able to use in your research. The list goes on.

All in all, the top journals are run by for-profit companies and their goal is to make money off of subscriptions to their journals. They publish the sexiest papers and they don’t care how their decisions affect scientists’ careers. To be fair they never asked to be the arbiters of academic success.

I think PhD students recognize the need to publish and get grants, so they push for high-impact publications by significantly upping the amount of time they put into their work. Working harder increases one’s chances of success for sure, but probably by only a modest amount in my opinion, and can be counterproductive if it tanks your mental/physical/social health.

I think anyone considering a PhD should know that academia is far from the ideal meritocracy it would like to be. You need to have a backup plan because it’s possible you won’t be dealt the right cards to be able to secure yourself a stable academic job down the line.

cbafj02,rpglover64,t2_4a1gd,"Firstly, there's an opportunity cost: you spend 5 to 7 years getting paid a small (compared to what many fields could make in industry) salary/stipend, or possibly not being paid (typically, but not universally in humanities PhDs). According to [this](http://chronicle.com/article/PhD-Attrition-How-Much-Is/140045/) recent article, you have even odds of completing a PhD program, and though there isn't _much_ data about it, and it varies significantly by institution, [this](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6070/864.abstract) paper suggests that if you manage to _get_ a tenure track position, you have only a 50% shot of getting tenure (but see SnowblindAlbino's [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1j1uwt/undergrad_here_planing_on_going_to_academia_with/cbafydc) below).

Now it's not entirely unreasonable to view tenure as a holy grail: good, though not superlative pay, flexible hours, and incomparable job security, doing (probably, if you manage to stick with it) something you enjoy. But it becomes less rosy if you look at your other job prospects for the next 10 years and compare your savings and psyche if you earn more but live off the same amount.

For the most part, though, sacrifices come in terms of the difficulty maintaining a good work-life balance. Matt Might has some more [advice](http://matt.might.net/articles/work-life-balance/) on the topic; crucially, he makes the point that ""As a grad student, it's important to list the things for which you would give up on your Ph.D."" Which would you choose if you had to choose between your PhD and your relationship, family, health, etc. It's not that those choices _will_ come up but that they _might_, and people are bad at rationally dealing with sunk costs.

There are many programs that are, let's say for the sake of not being judgmental, _incompatible_ with some students, and you often can't tell if you're going to have problems until you're months or years in. Sometimes its due to your advisor (too harsh or too lax are the nicest reasons for incompatibility); other times its due to colleagues or an unconducive work environment; yet other times it's due to geographical location and/or inability to find your niche. Being in such a program takes a mental toll, decreasing your life satisfaction and your work quality.

You'll learn to cope with stress and self esteem issues, or you'll have a bad time, but you may have long streaks when you can't deal with it. Sometimes (e.g. paper deadlines) you will be in crunch mode; sometimes when you're in crunch mode, and stressed as a result, life will fuck you over (e.g. breakup, housing issues, illness), and you might not have enough of a reserve to deal with it gracefully, so you mess up the paper and now you have _two_ problems to deal with.

Note that most of these issues are not _unique_ to academia (for example, you can see them in medicine, law, and start-ups), but in others, you tend to have a better chance at the employment you hoped for or a better chance of becoming wildly successful.",0,2013-07-26 01:38:00,AskAcademia

gf6hrqi,ChemMJW,t2_gzakt,"&gt;If the judgement is not foolproof and it can't be by design (the prof doesn't know the student inside out), why then should they say anything at all about the student not being cut out for the field. 

Because all decisions made by any human anywhere are based on imperfect information.  The lack of perfect accuracy or perfect knowledge of a situation does not in any way imply that a judgment cannot or should not be made. In general, an expert's opinion (the professor's) is clearly to be trusted far more than a novice's (the student's).  That's the whole point of experience.  As I clearly wrote in my original comment, experience doesn't mean the judgment is always right, but if you had to guess as to whose opinion was more likely to be correct, the professor's or the student's, it's clear whose opinion you should accept every time.

&gt;It's up to the student to decide whether they are fit for a field, regardless of how many years it would take. It's their life, and they would be solely responsible for their decisions

Of course it is.  So what?  The fact that the ultimate decision lies with the student doesn't in any way preclude the giving of informed opinions.  The student is free to accept or reject those opinions as the student sees fit.  The ultimate responsibility for the decision *and its consequences* lies with the student.

&gt;IMO it isn't acceptable for a prof to give out judgements like this to students, even if they're thinking that they're going to do the students a favour, or doing it for the benefit of the student. 

Of course you're entitled to whatever opinion you want.  But experienced faculty have a different opinion based on our interactions with many thousands of students over a career.

&gt;Things like this can have very severe impacts on the mental health of students and the prof doesn't know what the student's background is or what the student might be struggling with in their personal life.

Academic and professional standards don't vary based on a student's private affairs.  Faculty are not social workers, financial advisors, spiritual advisors, psychological counselors, or surrogate parents.  Our responsibility is to teach content X and then evaluate whether a student has learned it.  If learning is more difficult for a student because of difficulties in the student's private life, that's completely understandable.  The correct thing to do is for the student to put off further studies until the student's private affairs are in order, not to charge ahead while underperforming and then act astonished when told that this level of performance won't cut it in the field.

&gt;It's the student's own life and career, they get to decide what they should or shouldn't do.

Since my proposal was accepted for presentation at an academic conference, it must be viable. So, would a faculty member typically agree to work with a student (alumni, in my case) on a smaller scale project?

Regarding my relationship with the professor:

&gt;It would have gotten back to her anyway, and your relationship would have been ruined either way.

The situation is even worse than what's described because I didn't just mention this one email but a couple of others where her tone seemed to change. However, I likely misinterpreted those too. I've tried arduously to rectify the situation, but so far my efforts have been to no avail. Besides complaining about the chair, I've explained to each level of administration (and now the Board of Regents) that I overreacted due to a mental health condition and requested that any consequences to her be reversed (and any record of this in personnel file removed). Yet, so far everyone has sided with the chair and closed my case. (I'm hoping the Board of Regent will be able to help me.) What makes this most difficult for me is that this professor has since retired, and I'll never have the chance to reconcile with her now. It's not even that I want a letter of recommendation from her; I sincerely admired her and at times am overwhelmed with guilt over this.

I still hold the chair responsible, however, because students often write in an emotional/upset state and sometimes just need some time to calm down. He could have encouraged me to communicate with her without telling her (or other faculty) about the email. (I'd probably feel just as guilty for writing it, however.)

It wasn't until I realized the somewhat shitty culture, extremely poor work\-life balance, and difficulty of actually landing a tenure track job that I considered other careers. It was a big crisis for me.

I've been told a few things that have helped me. One is that academia is for depth, not breadth. You are interested in many things. I am too! Therefore, the potential for specializing in one particular niche is  possibly very boring. Another issue, like you said, is the arrogance of a lot of professors. This varies by field, school, and department, but yes, I do think that having a PhD is likely to go to \*anyone's\* head. Being grounded/realistic/not snooty is important for me and that culture seems very toxic. Again, some people have great luck and end up in caring and intellectually stimulating environments. But a lot of others end up with abusive bosses and crazy schedules.

What I am considering now is becoming a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner \(it would take me about 5\-6 years since I have a BA in cognitive science\), while continuing to do some science communication on the side.

czmt11x,Animostas,t2_4sqg4,"I was an undergrad at Columbia, where I think a fairly high portion of the students went to psychological/counseling services at some point (myself included). I also have a number of family members involved in academia, so I feel I have an ok grasp of mental health awareness from both the students' and faculties' point of view.

I think the main thing to do for classroom settings is to make it really clear in your syllabus what to do in the case of mental health emergencies, stick to it, and never mention it again. Something like, ""You can delay a homework submission or exam if you have a note from psychological services or a private counselor,"" or change it however you see fit. I like this a lot because it gives leeway to people who really need the help, but it also prevents students from being coddled, which sort of be the environment of colleges nowadays. It says, ""If you need some additional assistance because of personal issues, that's fine, but it's your responsibility to bring it up because I, nor the TA's, can read your minds.""

On a similar note, make sure that you and your TA's are on the same page about most things: grading policies/strictness, class notes, etc. I've had so many TA's who didn't know anything about class lectures, which is fine because they're super smart and know the material, but would end up using totally different notation that what I was used to. It started to feel like I was struggling against the professor than against the material.

For the setting of your research group, I think a good way to think about it is that you're like a small business owner without an HR. Which is cool because it's intimate and creative, but sometimes your students suck and can be annoying to each other. I would encourage them to be able to come to you if they have any really irreconcilable problems. But most importantly, it's an incredible morale boost for the professor to just be in the office with the door cracked open. Knowing ""my professor is around working as hard as I am, probably even harder,"" is so priceless. The worst mentors I've had were the ones who just threw me to their grad students/postdocs while they were never in their own room and doing God knows what.

When evaluating the transition from a closed society into an open society, do we generally see free speech taking form or more censorship?

giw2vi7,small_clay_jug,t2_9cmk58ri,"Honestly this post sort of made me a little sick to my stomach remembering my undergrad years, having gone to a school exactly like the one you're describing. Implying that Trader Joes and Whole Foods are the absolute basic necessities is the kind of ingrained classism that made me remember professors snidely interacting with the ""yokel"" student population. You don't have to absolutely love living there, but you have to realize everyone else living in that town is doing it somehow. 

Most of the time these small towns have a general store in that town or in the next town over. It's not Trader Joes, but most of the time you can actually find the best regional food stocked there. Much of the time they'll even have super local produce. The general store in my hometown sells milk from a farm a few miles away, maple syrup and honey from a farm the next town over, etc. You might have luck if your college town has a little food co-op, which is what stores like Trader Joes are built after. It's honestly a little disappointing you're limiting yourself to franchise stores, some of the coolest things I've found have been in tiny country stores. I grew up in a much more rural place than you're describing, and the way my family handled getting stuff from stores in larger amounts was pick one day of the week and make it an afternoon trip. 

If you have any friends in the college, why not build your own foodie activities. Start making recipes you've been dying to try out, and invite your friends. Have them make something, like a potluck. More than that, they're going to have some insight into where the best food in the region is. You can start making recipes with the local produce-- I guarantee food coming shortly from the source tastes very different than out of Trader Joes. You're not into the outdoors, but I've found my mental health improving drastically once I started taking short daily walks, and I anticipate your mood about this whole situation would improve with a little familiar routine. 

The other thing about small towns is that they usually have something going on in the town library, or the rec hall, or something similar. During the summer my tiny town has a craft fair, another town eight miles over has a cheese festival, and there's countless other places with something similar. You can often pick up excellent quality local food and crafts for a fraction of the price what stores in the city would sell them for.

If you absolutely miss the city, book a room in a hotel for the weekend and make a mini vacation of it. We academics often have three or four day weekends scattered throughout the year.

Finally, while I recognize small town life isn't everyone's cup of tea, there's a lot small towns can in fact offer. I would really encourage you to allow yourself to explore a totally different culture, it might give you something surprising. Most of it is totally word of mouth, you're not often going to find it marked on Google Maps.

As someone in a major where a Masters or PHD is certainly valuable enough to find myself tempted into grad school, I say get out now.

Second, you could search Google to see if there's a page for your university's mental health services.  Maybe you could get on the phone and talk with the people there, like how to make an appointment and if the building is in a place that makes you feel comfortable going.

Third, you could talk in confidence to a Dean, a resident adviser, or an ombudsperson.  They can probably help you find out information, and they will be very professional and keep your confidences.

eo8ofab,tchomptchomp,t2_6x557,"A few things.

&amp;#x200B;

First, you need to check both your offer letter and your TA contract. Does your offer letter guarantee you a certain number of TAships? Then that's legally binding. Does your TA contract clearly specify your role and are you being castigated for not finishing things well outside your clearly specified role? If so, then they can't legally terminate that position either. If your university has a unionized grad student organization, you need to bring all this with supporting communication to your union rep.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, check your offer letter because most offer letters guarantee you a stipend per annum. You should not have to worry about finances because of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Third, this may be more political than you think and may have little to do with you. As you said, the department head and the professors who are upset with you are not from your subfield. For all you know, there are other motivations here (e.g. freeing up TAships so they can take their own students off their grants, infighting between subfields, efforts to add material to courses without paying for more TA hours). You need to take this all less personally because it may not be personal at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Take the RA and focus on your research. You'll find that you'll get a lot more done when you're not spending 30 hours a week on TAship that's paying you for 15-20 hours a week. Do good research, publish it in good journals, and ignore this dumb drama. Take some of the extra time you free up and put it towards yourself and your mental health.

That's a massive problem and relates to wider issues of self-selection regarding mental health support in a variety of institutional settings. As for how we might go about addressing it--I'm not sure. Better outreach and more funding for mental health resources/counselling etc. would be a start.

I do agree that course design is 100% an easier mechanism by which we can address social inequalities, but at the same time I don't think a system of mild weighting based on social background and other risk factors for disadvantage would hurt in grading mechanisms as long as it's not tipping grades by 5+ percentage points. It would doubtless be clumsy in some respects, but considering the empirically observed differences in life outcomes that arise from being born in this or that zip code, it seems like the right thing to do.

I think you are putting the cart before the horse here. You are putting a great deal of emphasis on min/maxing your career and 'climbing the ladder'. 

Having career goals is good, and it's important to have a vision for yourself - but I think there are some other questions that you should ask yourself. Where does your lifestyle factor into this? Where do you want to live? What kind of life do you want to have there? How does family factor into this? How does a partner fit into this? Do you want to have kids/family? How might they factor into these moves? 

Life isn't a race nor is the academy a tower you need to climb. I'm still fairly early career, but I've realised that there is no end to that - there is no point at which you think ""I did it"". If you set yourself up to chase the horizon now, you'll have a hard time ever getting out of that mentality. And its certainly not the best from a mental health perspective (have a look at the work of Richard Sennet if you are interested in this area).

And I think it's important to recognise that grad school can be stressful, lonely, and quite difficult mentally/emotionally. And this is for a lot of students, not just people with a track record of poor mental health.

Of course but this is called life. Being professional (as well as growing up for that matter) means being able to get out your comfort zone especially when it comes to decisions like that. If you have the opportunity to go to a school that is MUCH more prestigious, it should be a no-brainer to go there, even if this may be stressful at first (which it will, that is the whole point: The point is to challenge yourself to get better, otherwise you won't learn and you won't grow). Yes you may be lonely at first when going to a new environment and it may even be difficult mentally/emotionally but this is true for every human being on this planet who arrives there new so you have plenty of people who are in the exact same boat as you. On the other hand: It may even be the most liberating and fantastic experience of your life.

Always staying in your comfort zone breeds lazyness and mediocrity which you should avoid like the plague if you want to get anywhere in academia or any other attractive or lucrative job. Staying in a much worse school just because it is in walking distance to your childhood home is a bad, bad, bad decision. There are no two ways about it.

cfscpts,[deleted],,"I can only comment on my field from the perspective of a potential graduate student in clinical psychology:

1. Get rid of interviews. Base evaluations on applicant files, references, publications, standardized scores, work experience, etc... Interviews are unreliable as hell. How can you show your best side when your nerves have turned you into a shaking, blubbering fool or an aloof motormouth or what have you.

2. Get rid of the ridiculous gender bias. We've done a full 180 over the past few decades, where men are now in the minority by a huge margin. Research shows that this effect is independent of applicant gender ratios and individual merit. Not only is it unfair to male applicants and unhealthy for academia, but it means there's a severe shortage of male clinicians and psychotherapists. 

3. Place more emphasis on mental health, personality, life experience, interpersonal skills, and other factors that indicate an applicant's potential as a helping professional. Yes, research potential is important, but way too many clinical grad students look great on paper yet run away from therapy as soon as they realize they're not cut out for it—or worse, they keep going and become horrible therapists.

4. Make admission less dependent on compatibility with lab and supervisor research. The system is set up so that only those students are accepted who are deemed most likely to help publish successful research that guarantees funding for the supervising PI. Pursuing your own interests and carving your own path leads to better science and happier scientists. 

5. (Accept me into the clinical psychology graduate program, damnit).

The age of psychologists as master clinicians who can diagnose and treat complex mental disorders is done. Increasingly public and private health agencies are replacing us with social workers and masters level therapists who may have a single year of clinical training. The average psychologist has 7 years of graduate school, an MSW can be completed in one full year. Psychiatrists don't respect assessment and don't realize how little they know, ms providers don't respect research, and our market share is consistently eroded. 

Roughly 20% or less of applicants get into a psychology PhD. More than half of med school applicants are accepted to one medical school. 95% of med students graduate, compared to about 80% of PhD. Psychiatrists spend 4 years in formal graduate didactic schooling, psychologists spend 6-7. And yet psychiatrists are the default leaders of teams despite the fact that they aren't as acquainted with the research, aren't qualified to do assessment, and half the time don't know what they are looking at.

Here is what you should do. Take the easy path. Go to some random DO school, become a psychiatrist, and live on easy street forever.

I'm from a third world country. It's filled with poverty, stigma, ignorance, crime and corruption. Mental health isn't really discussed over here.

Probably due to this, my university has received low inquiry rate on accommodations and hence doesn't have a system to grant accommodations. This past semester, I had to disclose my ADHD to professors and other people who weren't mental health professionals to get extra time on exams.

I was not granted extra time on my first exam this past semester but was later granted extra time on the other exams.

The person in our ""disability office"" (consists of two people, one is a secretary) was able to be of little help because she was afraid of losing her job or being seen as challenging deans or professors. She did refer me to her boss the dean of students support

But I didn't need to talk to the dean of student support because I spoke to the head of the college counseling office who is more influential and has more expertise.

In a few hours, I'm going to talk to the head of the college counseling office about how I believe I was treated unfairly by my school (it's hard to blame any one particular person because they're really all victims of our third world society), how I might obtain disability documentation and so on.
