When I logged into Reddit this morning, my inbox was annihilated and the post had entered the top 10 links of all time on the subreddit. It sparked a lot of support, and dissent. My purpose in posting here today is to better organize some of the points touched upon in the comments and answer some questions that came up. Hopefully this will serve as another jumping off-point for discussion.

# Mental Health Struggles
This sufficiently answers a query put forth by /lindenlinden69er 

*I suppose what I am asking is: were you unhappy during the PhD?*

Right off the bat I need to address the mental health struggles that come with this kind of work. I received three(!!!) private messages from users who wanted to privately express to me that they were happy I posted what I did because they were up against similar negative outcomes and experiencing intense anxiety and depression as a result. One messenger had even gone on academic leave because of it. I have also struggled with anxiety and depression throughout grad school. **Please take care of yourself and get help early and often, on campus or elsewhere.**  I intend to write a full post on this topic at a future date.

# Who Are You?
A lot of comments asking for more details about my situation. I wish I could give them but I am terrified of being doxxed - it would probably destroy my academic job prospects. To recap from the other thread and elaborate a bit more: 

- In an Arts/Humanities discipline
- ABD
- Diss written
- Defense scheduled
- Work presented at all major conferences in discipline
- Work presented at major conferences in tangential disciplines
- Multiple solo-author pubs
- Teaching experience
- 0% success rate after 113 applications submitted to various academic and industry positions
- “Fully funded” - according to university calculations for cost of living, etc. (I was politely told to fuck off when I explained to the department head that their calculations were very low for the area where the university is.)
- Still have accruing debt from undergrad/master’s and have taken out loans to offset cost of living during PhD. Large debt now.

# Pyramid Scheme

/u/lumabugg points out:

*The PhD market is oversaturated because it’s the only way big universities can afford to teach everyone, while knowing full well most students won’t get a tenure-track job because too many people graduate from PhD programs (while the colleges continue to use grad student labor instead of hiring more faculty). Meanwhile, we were brought up with this idea that if you just work harder, you’ll succeed, which has created a bunch of graduate students and post-docs who have convinced themselves that their lack of career prospects is their own moral failing and not the failing of a system that churns out more graduates than the market could ever handle.*

This enhances the point on **Mental Health Struggles** above. **The lack of career prospects is not your fault. There is a systemic corruption that is inherent in this system. Information about such corruption is not highly visible, that’s what inspired me to write my last post.** Can you imagine if I shared my real name with the last post? It would be instant academic career suicide! In this manner, the institution protects itself from any dissenting voices. Lack of these dissenting voices cause otherwise mentally healthy individuals to question if they have “done enough” by getting a PhD (something that less than 1% of the population had accomplished). 

In case it needs said - I think you have worth as a human, and if you’re getting a PhD you likely have an above average IQ and are at least somewhat more industrious than most of the general population.

# Rationalize, Rationalize, Rationalize
Instead of getting justifiably angry at a systemic problem - an emotion that may lead to systemic change - countless commenters offered advice on modifying my job hunt. I appreciate the good advice, but others suggested that I leave the US behind for greener…err beiger pastures. /u/duderightnow comments:

*I’d say try one of the Persian Gulf countries (Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, etc)*

# The University Question
/u/ph0rk responds to my assertion the the university is on the decline:

*I assume you meant enrollment. Enrollment is on the decline in small regional schools and less prestigious LACs. Large research universities are seeing an enrollment increase.*

Agreed. Without giving out doxxable information, I can report that my own institution just set a major record in this regard. I am not suggesting that enrollment will take a massive and immediate hit. **Instead, I am suggesting that the value proposition of college-as-service is failing. A weak value proposition is the harbinger of massively decreasing enrollment.** 

I encourage you to hit the pavement and ask undergraduates some questions. I make a point to socialize regularly with undergraduates on campus not involved in my own classes. Most of them in the first couple of years of study report that **they are attending college largely because it was expected of them by their parents, or for some other status-signaling reason.** Once it becomes common knowledge among a new generation of parents that college has no value proposition in terms of new knowledge to be acquired, attendance will severely and maybe irreversibly drop.

---

# Boomer Logic
/u/brock_coley suggests that I’m not trying hard enough:

*For instance, go to specialised job fairs to network and introduce yourself, make yourself known to industry headhunters, make friends with privious grads who are now in industry, look up people on linkedin in the companies/positions you want to work in and ask them out for an informational coffee. Just as you are probably ready to relocate for an academic job, you should also expect to move for a good industry-based job.*

[Which inevitably comes off like this.](https://i.imgur.com/DXhOUy4.jpg)

---

# Industry Work

/u/nbbby27 asks:

*“Why is the PhD a count against you in industry?”*

Some good answers in the comment area but none illustrating the main issue I have had with this - those in industry don’t want to hire PhDs because they  believe us to be overqualified, i.e. they won’t be able to offer a good enough salary to keep us. Corollary - PhDs are a risky hire because as soon as that R1 job offer comes up we’ll leave. This is actually what I’m planning on doing. **I’ll get whatever industry job I can drum up, tell them that I don’t want anything to do with academia anymore, and leave immediately when I get a good offer from a school. I have no conscience about burning a system that’s stacked against us.**

---

# Other Paths
/u/pastaandpizza muses:

*Why not pursue “virtually any other path” than a PhD, right now ie if you were qualified for excellent industry jobs or other non-phd jobs before you pursued your PhD, surely you’re still competitive for those same paths now?*

You’re right those paths are still mostly valid, and this is largely what I intend on doing. It is now a very uphill battle though. Consider it from the non-academic’s point of view, this is what they see - one candidate with 5 years of solid industry experience, another candidate that was in school for 5 years, probably slacking off and avoiding the real world - who do you think they will choose? I have received numerous rejection letters from industry jobs so far that say I don’t have enough real-world experience. 

---

I think that summarizes most of what was generally brought up in the last thread. Many of you in humanities/arts PhDs are going to come up against the same struggle I’m up against right now. For this reason, I ask all of you, **What do we do about this broken system?** I think not only could this be a productive discussion, but also bring up possible solutions or workarounds that will be actionable for current and future grad school graduates.

iryzhu,SeekingToEscape,t2_7wu8bo8b,"Always dreamed of becoming an academic, intellectual, or artist. Now I just feel stupid, hopeless, lost and useless. Where do I go from here?","English lit major at a top tier liberal arts university but with a low-ish gpa (3.2 at the moment, mostly due to one F), erratic performance (winning awards and prizes, internships, failing out and withdrawing lots of classes) plus two medical leaves of absence for mental health, etc. 

Where do I go from here? I love school and literature to death. I feel like it’s my whole world. I put all my eggs into one basket then dropped the basket. I just always assumed that because I loved literature so so much and put everything into it there would be a teaching job for me somewhere, whether at a nice high school or a college. But now I realize that even getting a job at a high school is tough these days. Outside of teaching I have absolutely no clue what I’d want to do or be remotely capable of. I feel severely underprepared and useless to society. And my mental health is so damn fragile at the moment as you can see from this post that I don’t know how I’m going to survive any of it, the rejections, the criticisms, I need to get tougher skin. I’m a mess. 


I don’t know what to do. I mean I have no real strengths to go on. I was given all these resources and I’m just not doing anything with it. 

I’m still have a year or two left in college. I always wanted to be a professor. Wanted to get a PhD, teach, research all of it. English and art classes and reading and research have always been the most important things in my life. I just really thrived on the ideas, getting so absorbed in them, I felt I would . I felt so at ease and joyful and fascinated when writing papers and reading theory. Philosophy, literature, art criticism. It has consumed my life and given it a lot of meaning and value and joy. In fact, it’s been a bit of a crutch so that I feel addicted. On summer breaks I feel like I’m withdrawing. I hated snow days growing up. I’d live at school if I could. 

I struggled with burnout and my mental health in college. Though I’m still totally in love with literature and writing and doing research, my grades have dropped because I have become paralyzed by perfectionism, distracted by some unfortunate romantic fixations and battling with substance abuse and a bipolar disorder diagnosis and a lot anxiety. For so many reasons I’ve come to realize I will never be an academic or live the intellectual “life of the mind.” It’s just not realistic and I’ve screwed up too many times and even for the perfect candidate it’s basically impossible. 

I went to one of the most selective, expensive small liberal arts universities. I received a fantastic literary education that I cherish but that also embarrasses me. I feel selfish and self-indulgent and stupid And confused and lost and useless and like a disappointment to everyone around me.

I’m being so dramatic I don’t know what’s wrong with me or how you are even reading this far without puking but I guess I suddenly just realized that I have virtually no skills or assets and that people who didn’t even go to college, or went to much “lesser-tier” colleges, are likely more or at least equally equipped for the vast majority of jobs as me.

I have ADD, slow processing speed, anxiety, depression etc. and while I know those labels don’t define me, they are pretty darn consistent throughout my life despite therapy and meds. Even when I’m relatively “normal,“ in terms of functioning, I will always be more scatterbrained, forgetful, unassertive and inefficient than the vast majority of people. And I don’t have strengths to counterbalance it. Not useful strengths.No employer would want me! 

Sure, I am “creative” (or so I am told) but I’ve never felt it came to any use. I can’t come up with novel solutions to actual problems or anything. I’m not quick on my feet. I am defensive and try to avoid criticism as much as possible instead of learning from it. I’m horrendously bad with time management even when I work on it, and have improved, I’m still far worse than most. I’m very messy and disorganized no matter how hard I try to stay neat. And my speaking and communication style is so indirect and tangential it drives most people crazy. I am capitalism’s worst nightmare. But also just most people’s worst nightmare of a person. I’m essentially a child. 

I’m not even really a good writer. I’m long-winded, slow, confusing, hyperbolic, disorganized and never sure what to include or leave out. 

My only strengths and talents are hardly useful or desirable on the job market: “original, interesting, nice, authentic, in touch my emotions, introspective, insightful, abstract, philosophical, obsessively enthusiastic about certain topics, interested in the mysteries of the universe blah blah blah...” 

Like I can’t think of a single reason anyone in any real life job would want to hire me. I feel worthless and useless and like an “extra” unnecessary little human who is trying to find a place in a world where she’s frankly not needed or wanted.",150,2020-09-13 14:14:29,AskAcademia
7wihb6,MsFrizzle94,,Just Earned PhD in Cognitive Psychology &amp; It Wasn't Worth It,"I received my PhD in Cognitive Psychology in August 2017 from an R1 university (I'm not going to identify the university right now).  To get straight to the point:  It wasn't worth it.  Not even close.  If I could go back in time and turn down the offer, I would.

But I can't, so here's the reality:  I currently have a one year position as Assistant Professor of Psychology at a small liberal arts college.  My initial starting salary offer was $51,291.59.  After two months of tense and frustrating negotiations, the university made a second offer, so my salary for the 2017-2018 academic year is $56,549.17.
I bring home $1,523.58 biweekly after taxes.  After paying rent, electricity, internet, cell phone bill, groceries, and student loan payments, I have very little money left over at the end of the month. Additionally, I have no job security-- I am constantly applying for (and being rejected from) faculty positions for the upcoming 2018-2019 academic year.

I have astronomically high student loan debt.  I will be making payments for the rest of my life.  There are very few faculty positions open for cognitive psychologists and when those positions do open up, the search committees receive tons of applications.  One of the positions I recently applied for had 58 applicants.

Additionally-- if you are currently a PhD student and think that earning your PhD is the light at the end of the tunnel, you are wrong.  You will continually be forced to prove your worth over and over again.  You'll need to prove your worth for job applications, for tenure track positions, for raises and promotions.  

I have a bachelors degree in psychology, two master's degrees, a PhD, and an advanced graduate certificate.  I have publications.  I have years of research experience.  But I feel like none of that matters.  I'm back at square one again.

The four years I spent earning my bachelors degree and the two years I spent earning my first masters degree were very enjoyable.  Those were the six years that made me fall in love with psychology...with science as a whole.  With academia.  

The five years I spent in my PhD program (where I earned my second master's degree and my advanced graduate certificate) were the worst five years of my entire life.  I worked day and night...60-80+ hours each week.  My stipend from being a TA wasn't enough to live off of.  The department knew that; it was common knowledge that most of the grad students were struggling to put food on the table...but no one with any power cared enough to do anything about it.  

My PhD advisor was abusive.  She expected me to work non-stop, to be available any time she needed to meet with me...evenings, weekends, holiday ""breaks.""  She constantly put me down.  It wasn't constructive criticism.  It was abuse.  Minor, often inconsequential errors resulted in a barrage of criticism-- I wasn't good enough, I would ""never make it"" in academia, I don't have ""a scientific mind.""  She would criticize me for planning to go home for the holidays to visit my family and if I went anyway, she would flood me with emails asking when I was coming back to work.  She was constantly pushing me to work harder, to work faster, to be more productive...design more experiments, run more participants, analyze data faster, know every single detail of the results, etc.  Memorize the means, the standard deviations, know every single inferential statistic.  Write it all up.  Perfectly.  Drafts would be returned to me with pages and pages and pages of edits and she would sigh and shake her head in exasperation if a new draft with all of the feedback incorporated wasn't returned to her within the next day or two.  I barely slept, I barely ate.  I always had a million things hanging over my head.  There was no relief, not for a second.  I ended up in the hospital for 5 days from exhaustion and was then put on anti-anxiety medicine.  But it didn't stop.  It actually got worse, because on top of the criticisms, she would add that I was ""overly sensitive.""

Long story short-- I made it through.  I graduated.  But now what?  Few job opportunities, low pay...I feel like I have no control over my life.  If I want a good job, I need to be willing to go wherever someone is willing to hire me.  There's little to no chance of being able to stay close to my family and friends.  

I'm frustrated and angry.  My mental health has been destroyed.  My confidence is completely gone.  I have more student loan debt than I can ever possibly pay off.  

I wish this doctorate came with a money back guarantee.  I would have returned it a long time ago if it meant that I could get my life back.  If I could follow a different path where I would make more money, have better options, more control, more job security.  I've invested so much time, money, effort...I've sacrificed more than I can describe.  I feel like I'm completely stuck and it is devastating.

bnkkhh,gradschoolabuse,t2_23jv8dzt,Academia has given me chronic mental health problems,"I am a postdoc who escaped a 'lab' with a notoriously toxic mentor. I survived 8 years with that person, it was the biggest regret in my life. The person is a classic toxic narcissist, and I am now recovering in a new lab. The new lab is far far more functional, and I have that to thank for not killing myself. 

Suffice to say, the last PI pulled such shit and ended quitting to become promoted elsewhere, I was blackmailed and had to switch advisor 6 months before defending -- Despite knowing them for 8 years. I was so so happy to get out, but now my name is totally tarnished in academia. Old PI has slandered my name as much as possible. I am honestly feeling pretty bad in the new postdoc, I see a therapist but I feel old PI got their nails under my skin permanently, like a sick mental possession. The emails I still receive are totally disturbing to say the least, and I complained to my old university up until the point I graduated. Now I am gone and moved 5000 miles away, so I do not talk about it anymore. I try not to talk about the situation with new lab, I have dropped hints to new labmates about the creepy shit I went thru and they say it's complete bulllshit I hopefully will never have to experience again.

cyuo99,usedhandles,t2_3fg9by85,Labour Day thread on precarious labour in post-secondary education:,"Polemically put: post secondary educational facilities thrive on precarious labour. 

Some of this impacts our graduate students (as teaching assistants, research assistants, and people training to get a job one day), adjuncts, VAPs, non-ladder faculty, and postdocs. This precarity can then increase the workload of everyone higher above them (more letters of reference to write, more job applications to read, more work to supervise \[if they do it\]). 

Precarious labour in the academy has been suggested to impact the [quality of teaching](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Conditions-Imposed-on/125573) (caveat: this article sparked a lot of controversy), [the production of hostile work environments](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2019/02/14/how-bias-toward-adjuncts-plays-out-among-students-other-faculty-and-administrators), and mental health crises (CW: [suicide](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/04/adjunct-professors-higher-education-thea-hunter/586168/)).

Precarious work extends far beyond the academic staff of a university found in the invisible labour that keep these institutions afloat: [food staff](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/11/huds-strike-retrospective/), janitorial staff, and part-time administrators. 

The consequences of precarious work extend far beyond the quality of life issues associated with economic and job security  ([example 1](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2019/08/hefty-university-fees-are-sending-some-grad-students-food-banks), [example 2](https://tenureshewrote.wordpress.com/2014/01/16/succeeding-in-graduate-school-despite-poverty/), [example 3](http://neatoday.org/2017/11/01/homeless-professor/), [example 4](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/28/adjunct-professors-homeless-sex-work-academia-poverty), [example 5](https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/april-may-june-2019/how-college-professors-turned-into-uber-drivers/)) as well as issues of health insurance and retirement plans (for those not working in social welfare states).

I applied to 12 grad schools for political science studying contemporary China in the 2018 cycle and did not get into any of them. I don't know why I was rejected completely - I was told by my advisors and grad school admissions staff that my application made me a strong candidate, I have internships and a great GRE, and I had great personal recommendations - but just that there weren't enough spaces and very vague advice about 'fit'.

I'm not completely helpless though. I had my masters in public policy and I have a job (just under $20/hr and with great health insurance) in university administration where I'm using my Chinese language skills. So I could be worse off. But I'm just coming out of a nasty cycle of high-functioning depression and now that my mental health is getting better I'm looking for ways to boost my application for next time - I don't know if it'll be this cycle, but maybe the next one.  

I've talked to several professors of mine and they've suggested working on a study-abroad research fellowship in Taiwan to give my language skills that further boost, and I'm working with a former thesis supervisor of mine on an essay on stages of US foreign policy that might be published soon. Not in a peer-review journal, though, but more likely a regional affairs website and a public affairs magazine. 

I've also entertained the idea of teaching as an adjunct for a semester at a local community college to at least see if I'm suited for teaching and to see if I can contribute in some way.

I'm on my second year of my first postdoc (genetics), where it's been hinted I'd be moved up to a research asst. professor. 

I know the normal emotion should be excitement and celebration but:

I recently decided, accepted, and mourned that I wanted to GTFO out of academia or at the very least change labs ASAP.

Currently working in what is imo a sinking ship of a lab. To be brief I'm struggling to stay engaged in the work. We're also down to a skeleton crew and the social isolation is really having a big negative effect on my mental health.

So now when I read the application I sent out in the spring got funded, all I feel is trapped.

Im guessing my options are:

1) Stop bitching and just grind it out. True, the project is cutting edge and will be a huge CV boost even for industry work. However, I don't think I can stomach another two years at this lab.

2) Start reaching out to lab heads at other institutions ASAP to see if they could offer me a position. The grant is transferable, but it starts Jan 2020 so I need to hustle. Im assuming bringing some of my own funding with me will make this easier -- am I overlooking something? 

3) Continue applying to industry positions in the meantime and accept any attractive offer as it arises. I see the major risk here as major bridge burning, pissing off the funding agency, and being generally kinda shitty. Is turning down an award even a thing? I don't this grant allows it to transfer to another PI.

bvemx1,inthelabxo,t2_3v9n6kga,"I am student in a lab, another student is constantly asking me for help and I don't know how I should deal with it","I am currently one of a small number of students in a lab doing a research project. Our projects are independent but are very similar with a lot of overlap between them. We are quite a close group and therefore often arrange to go into the lab at similar times and we all help each other out e.g. if someone is going to get reagents they will get enough for all of us, etc. However, there is one student in the group who is constantly asking me for help. I did not mind at first but I have now become this person's default person to ask for help. However the help is not the occasional question such as asking for my general opinion or checking their working out for a calculation but constant questions about nitty gritty details of their experiment to the point where they want me to basically outline what they should do that day.

&amp;#x200B;

To put it kindly, and I know I may get flamed for saying this, this student is clueless. They have very poor English which means they cannot follow what is being discussed in lab meetings with our supervisor and they cannot comprehend what our supervisor wants us to do. They do not seem to understand much, from the general overarching theory behind the projects, to how to perform calculations (which are the same calculations we have been using for weeks now), to how to use a computer (let alone the complex software we need to use to analyze our results). I know this sounds horrible and unkind and I know they cannot help having a language barrier but I am burnt out from all of the extra help I have been giving them. For example, I spend time explaining how to get data off of the computer software and put it onto a USB drive, something that is simple to do, and I mean I really broke it down into baby steps which they wrote down, this week they still had me show them three more times and then when I was out of the lab they asked our other lab mate to save the files to their USB for them... It is just so hopeless. I spend three hours showing them how to use the software which we had been taught a couple of days before by our supervisor but because the supervisor speaks too quickly for them to understand so once again I really broke it down, but the questions they ask just show me that they have no comprehension or understanding of the software or the reasons why we are doing certain steps. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am at the point where I need to step back for the sake of my mental health and academic integrity. I know that without my help they would be completely lost but I am at the point where I do not care, they are not earning their degree this way. They do not deserve the degree. However, it is all well me saying that I do not want to help them anymore but they are quite manipulating. We are both, obviously, adults but this student is significantly older than me and I find it hard to say no to them. When they ask me questions I try and deflect and say they should ask our supervisor for help and they say ""no I want to ask you as you are good at this"" or some variation of that. They always want to come in the lab the same time as me so the past few days I have been purposely misleading them saying vague things like ""I might come in the morning"" and then not showing up until noon. However, I did this the other day and they sat at the lab bench from 9am to 11:30am waiting for me. Two and a half hours they sat there and did no work, just waiting for me because they had no clue what they were supposed to be doing.

bj5iw2,AuroraBroealis,t2_wimpb,How to deal with supervisor who wants to take first authorship of manuscript from my M. Sc. thesis?,"Hello everyone,

To make a long story sort of short, in the last year of my M. Sc. I was suffering from severe depression, anxiety issues due to an abusive supervisor's personal dislike for me and the events revolving around that in addition to post sugery physical health issues. Once I finished my thesis, I was crippled by these mental health issues for 8 more months until my treatment for them reduced them to very manageable levels. 

During the time before I felt better, my co-supervisor, who I did actually along with well, offered to help me push one of the papers from my thesis to publication, stating that he understood the issues I was going through and was happy to help effectively finish it for me. I thanked him and he did most of the work for publication, which included redoing most of the analyses and some figures and retooling the discussion and conclusion. I was always involved with this and constantly discussed the changes, their results and conclusions, even if I didn't write much of the text ( I actually did write nearly a page of once I was feeling normal again, though).

However, just recently as the paper is near submission, he has suddenly asked if he can be first author on it. This came as a complete shock as I always assumed I would be first author as I did 90% if the work up until he edited it at the end when I literally could not for months. Even the abusive supervisor who I had issues with has said I need these first authored papers to jumpstart my career/ PhD search, and they don't as they are now retired. It just feels like he took advantage of my health issues for an easy paper, and I don't know how to approach this and say that it isn't right? 

Let me know how you all might handle this situation. I'm at a loss.

TLDR: Co-supervisor claiming first authorship on my thesis paper after working on it to make it publishable while I was paralyzed by severe depression and couldn't do it myself. Looking for advice on how to say no.",65,2019-04-30 16:44:56,AskAcademia
ax1r1e,HumanDrinkingTea,t2_o4xhq,Is there a bias against students who use accommodations?,"In particular, I'm referring to students who appear outwardly ""normal."" In your experience, do professors question the legitimacy of these accommodations, even if they don't do so in an outward or public manner?

I'm a *very* strong student (I've received the highest grade in the class in all but one class that I've taken), but I am a bit older and it's my second go at college. The first time around, it was a disaster with health issues, which consist of both neurological and mental health problems. I managed to get through with a slightly above average GPA, but on close inspection of my transcript, it is obvious that something was up. My grades were almost entirely A's and F's, with nothing in between. 

Now it's a few years later and I'm in the midst of a career change. I now have a 4.0 in a challenging STEM field. My first semester back was a bit rough, but I pulled through. Since then, I've been doing much better. However, past experience has taught me that if I don't have accommodations in place, I am at serious risk of failing if something unexpected happens to my health. As a result, I am sure to get an accommodation letter and hand a copy to each of my professors at the beginning of the semester. 

I have gotten mixed reactions from professors, several of whom I greatly respect. One told me that I use accommodations as a ""crutch,"" with the implication that I don't need them. Another said outright that she thinks I don't need them. And she's right-- much of the time I don't. But sometimes I do, and I feel having them in place is a means of disaster prevention. However, I get the sense that professors may think that my choice to use accommodations reflects negatively on me. 

My question to those of you in academia is whether or not I should be worried that I will be taken less seriously because I have made use of accommodations. Is bias against individuals with ""invisible"" disabilities widespread? Or is it just a few professors who don't ""get"" it? If I am doing well, should I consider trying to go without? The sting of failing several semesters of undergrad still feels fresh, even though it was years ago now. Most people can't imagine that I've ever failed anything, but the risk of going without a safety net seems too high. Perhaps my professor's right and I am using it as a crutch?

I feel conflicted. On the one hand, I feel that maybe I don't deserve the accommodations I'm given or don't need them. On the other hand, I see it as necessary to prevent the disaster that happened several years ago. 

Can we have an honest conversation about accommodations in academia and how we feel about them? ",65,2019-03-04 02:24:11,AskAcademia
7ga1yh,amalgamationoffer,,"I was sexually assaulted by one of my professors, and am still trying to recover from the fallout from that to get back on track to a PhD. Appreciative of any advice.","Hey all, I'm in a bit of a conundrum. Couldn't tell you how grateful I would be for anyone to offer me advice.

As a kid, I had trauma in neurological health, and it became hardened into my identity that I would make sure I became a great researcher when I grew up. However, at the start of undergrad, I got hired to be a research assistant for a neuroscience lab by the head of the department (who was also my academic advisor), but I got sexually assaulted by one of my other professors in the same week. The best week of my life quickly became the worst week of my life. I couldn’t quite choke up the words to explain to my advisor what happened, and he just took my ensuing poor performance in the lab as evidence I shouldn’t go into research. It took me until my senior year working with counselors to heal from my PTSD. I still managed to get respectable grades in college, but I didn’t make close relationships throughout college. After graduating, I moved back home for financial reasons caused by my history of medical expenses.

Still driven to become a researcher, the nearest lab in my field was 3 hours away, and so I made the 6 hour total commute to/from the science lab many times every week. It never bothered me because I loved volunteering as a research assistant there so much. I felt on track in preparing myself for a PhD, everything seemed great for 3 months.

Suddenly, domestic abuse starts happening in my house between other relatives, what the actual hell. It soon became a very stressful environment, and it not only revived the issues with my mental health in college, but it revived the neurological issues I had when I was younger. Slippery slope started. I developed an addiction to cope with it all. The 6 hour commutes became harder, I couldn't be reliable anymore, and my service at the lab was discontinued by my supervisor. To try and get out of my home environment, a friend's father offered me a job so I could pay rent somewhere else and get out, but after a few months of even weaker performance, I was fired. And then, months of me doing nothing followed, just seeing doctors to heal myself. I was so suicidal, mostly because I felt my dreams to get a PhD in any reasonable amount of time were crushed, and it was all largely out of my control.

Home is better now, but it's been a year and a half since my graduation, and I've little to show for it. Didn't do an honors project or anything during college, didn't make many close relationships, but overall grades seemed similar to the average admitted PhD student, so I just needed research experience and people in the field to get to know me for letters of recommendation for the PhD. I'd been looking at schools like Northwestern and UC-Irvine due to the people who match my interests there, but now I feel very small and that my chances of getting into great schools like those have really been hurt. With how hard I try and recover from these setbacks to achieve my lifelong dream, there is no way I am letting myself settle for a school that is not excellent for my career, and I just don't know how to get back on track to get there.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but since I’m probably as healed as I’ll get now, I'm thinking that the best option for me now is to get a part-time or full-time research assistant position somewhere near the city (Chicago), move there to cut down on the commute, and on the weekends see if I can volunteer at another lab or the one I'd been volunteering at previously again. I’ve lost a lot of time out of the field already, and I certainly can’t afford to lose any more, right? 

However, they may ask for previous employment, letters of recommendation, and ask what I've been up to since graduation. There’s incredible competition out there! I don't know what to say without shooting myself in the foot. I want to seem hirable and make sure I do get hired. 

Additionally, without having an advisor that believes in my aspirations as a researcher, remaining in the dark about the consequences of my setbacks has been REALLY stressful. Like, I have no idea if the loss of these 1.5 years makes me now need 5-10+ years to prove myself or something like that. As anyone who has ever had PTSD can tell you, much comfort is brought in knowing what reality to expect or accept, even if it’s not a reality you wanted to accept. And if you’re the kind of above-and-beyond nice person out there who would be happy to take a look at my resume/academic details and give me specific advice on what else would really give me an advantage in getting into a great PhD program, that’d be awesome too. Just any help at all in this would be great.

I’m extremely grateful for any time you might offer me. Can’t say that enough. Thanks.",62,2017-11-29 03:11:42,AskAcademia

There's a student in my class who I am very concerned about. In the 2 months I have been teaching this class, she has dropped a lot of weight, going from a slim healthy looking girl to a stick with a head, literally. I mean, I look at her and I think her neck is about to snap under the weight of her head. The class is multiple times a week, and *every* class she just looks sicker and sicker. Sunken eyes, extremely slow movements. I finally decided to ask this question when I saw her nearly faint when getting up.

It's shocking. I have no knowledge of eating disorders, but this seems like the epitome of anorexia. It's a bloody shame too, she seemed like a very bright and engaged student to start with, now she hardly even looks up during class. 

I am not in america or in any of the more... evolved western countries, and unfortunately, there really is not much focus on student mental health or even a guide on scopes of faculty-student interactions, basically as long as we stand in front of class and teach them something, and as long as the students show up, the leadership is happy with it. 

This student is from abroad, and more than likely doesn't see her family more than once or twice a year, and I haven't really seen her with any friends, so I think if I don't do anything, no one will.

How should I prepare myself?","I'm currently applying to undergrad degree programmes (I have some offers from universities, but not all, yet) and my dream job is being a researcher/lecturer at a university. Unfortunately I've read and heard many terrifying stories about the bleak academic job market for the humanities and how even if you're willing to go to the remotest part of the globe to secure a job, you might not even get one, or you might end up jumping from one adjunct position to another without securing a tenure-track job.

Additionally, I've also heard that getting a PhD in the humanities and failing to get into academia will leave you stranded because you're nearly thirty without any working experience and essentially you'll be jobless and broke.

As I'm not from a rich family, and not particularly confident of my ability to marry a rich person (lol) the future sounds bleak and terrifying. At the same time I don't know if there's anything more important to me than ideas and books--I feel more at home and alive doing coursework than anything else--I'm the kind of person that gets obsessed and will work compulsively, and I also have emotional and mental health issues that make me doubt my ability to find happiness elsewhere. And all of this makes me think my only chance of finding fulfillment is pursuing an academic career.

So I'm not sure what I should do. Should I just go for it? Or find something else to do? Are there people here who've left academia and found fulfilling jobs elsewhere? Any advice would be really appreciated!

7kulfh,youthrwwy,,"I made a bad PhD choice for my career and personal life, don't know if the best is to push through, give up, or try to switch - I could really use some advice and perspective","When I finished my masters I felt like I was at the top of the world: my CV included engineering experience, some international internship both in industry and research, and a Master Thesis produced in one of the best institutions in my field in the world, as well as some publications in very good journals.

I got 4 PhD offers: 1 in the UK, one in Australia, and 2 in other western European countries. 

I chose one of the two in Western Europe because it was in a very renowned institution that I greatly admire. It is the kind of place that I have in my conference badge and people go ""wow, you must be smart!"". 

It is now evident to me that it was the worst possible choice I could have made.

* From the beginning, my supervisor refused to give me any hints on what type of project he would want me to pursue, but disliked any idea I had.

* Any attempt I made to maintain collaborations with other institutes/researchers was shut down, and even collaborations with other departments in the same institute were frowned upon (on all sides)

* I ended up not actually based in ""renowned institute"", but in another department in the same program. People from ""renowned institute"" consider the research made in my department to be second class.

* After thinking long and hard, I realized the research made in my department is, in general, indeed very poor.

* From the beginning I was pushed to work with one of the most toxic personalities I have ever met, and this greatly delayed my work, and took a huge toll on my mental health.

* This is not an isolated incident. In this department there are people from all over the world, and some are way more vulnerable than others. It is an environment with a lot of toxic mechanisms, and the more senior professors either turn a blind eye to it, or are guilty of it themselves. It makes me really sad to just be here.

I spent my first year doing some very tricky work to come up with a project that my supervisor liked, and became more and more isolated as I was driven away from people I used to collaborate with. The only person ""approved"" for me collaborate was not only not helpful, but incredibly toxic. My self-esteem started to decline, and my mental health in general started to suffer. 

And then there is the personal side: The PhD studies take so much of my time, I haven't been able to learn the local language. I haven't been able to fully integrate with the local culture, and feel very isolated. And the local culture is very different from my own, and is known to be much more closed and cold. That doesn't help at all.
The reason why I didn't want to give up was that my partner had moved to this city to be with me. I felt very guilty of quitting/switching and to leave this person, who gave up on everything to follow me around, in a very uncertain situation.

I decided to push through. Tried my best, stood up to my bully, and worked on all of it mostly on my own, achieved a lot. 

And then my partner decided that this was not going to work (being in this country), and left. I started going to therapy, was diagnosed with depression. 
I HAD NEVER GONE THROUGH THAT BEFORE. I was going through of mix of extreme stress related to work, along with loneliness, homesickness, cultural and social alienation.

That made me rethink everything, and I honestly don't know what to do. Right now I am going to my home country and will write my next article from there, and benefit from the good weather and being close to friends and family. 

But what do I do? I don't know if I can make it another 1.5 years in a place I don't belong, being lonely and working in a toxic environment with people I don't respect. 

But I also don't see how I can abandon almost 2 years of work. 

I feel like these 2 years costed me so much. Right now I have zero sense of self-worth, my mental health has degraded to a point of ""I can barely leave the bed"", I lost an incredible, great relationship, I can't stop thinking of the other opportunities I lost, and, well... I feel like I lost 2 full years of my life! 


There is a lot of venting here, I am sorry for that. 
The type of advice I need is, are there PhD programs/supervisors out there that would accept someone who already completed 2/3 of a PhD program elsewhere? I could bring with me an incredible amount of work that could be developed into something really cool. Would that be considered a failure by prospective employers in the future? Should I just suck it up, get some depression medication and spend another 1.5 year here trying to be done with this as fast as possible?

Now, of course, I'm not so naive to think that these issues are exclusive to just the academic world - BUT - I'm wondering if there's a higher prevalence of these issues, and if that's related to: the type of people academia attracts, the pressure of the academic workload and life, or a combination of these, or other factors.

The reason I'm posing this question is that it seems like a quiet storm that nobody wants to openly discuss and address, which is very upsetting considering that people I love are dead, or have almost died.

d9dhx1,jabberwock91,t2_rgshz,Steps towards leaving graduate school," Hi,

I'm in my 3rd year of a PhD program, and I have obtained a Masters in another field (In a semi-related field, I'll say). Long story short, I have been struggling with depression and suicidal ideations for quite some time now since entering this PhD program. This stems from the fact that I feel PhD/academia life is simply not for me. I love the content my program, the faculty, my classmates &amp; cohort. But the overall idea of academic work life depresses me in magnitudes I cannot explain. I am uncomfortable with teaching and sitting down to write a manuscript or my dissertation is great at giving me thoughts of suicide. I've talked with family, friends (outside of my cohort) &amp; a therapist about this, but no one in my department is aware. I have so many fears of how this will affect people's perceptions of me.

***As you may have gathered, I think it's time for me to take steps towards leaving graduate school.***

I need to start by disclosing to my advisor, right? This seems best to me. My advisor is aware I have struggles in mental health, but not the severity my mental health status. I do feel we have a good relationship. In fact, she was the reason I started my PhD program - I worked with her two years prior to becoming her official graduate mentee (I've known her for 5 years now). My hope is she will be understanding, but I am prepared for anything. I do always finish my work for her and I have worked/accomplished various tasks in our lab. In fact, she is the reason, this has taken so long, I respect her in ways I cannot express. However, I also cannot express what it is like to go home and simply feel empty and dead inside... For 2 years now. I've tried, believe me, I've tried to work through this (Medication, social support, therapy, ""working through it"") - But I need to accept that it is my time to leave. I love the thought of academia, not the actual participation in it, unfortunately.

I can't help but feel this conversation will be coming out of left field for her. How do I set up this meeting? I know it must start with an email, but how clear should I be in this email about what the conversation is about? To be quite honest, I don't know if I can have a face-to-face conversation without crying (I cry a lot in my current state). I am prepared for a slow transition out, I have accepted the inevitability of finishing up my semester, as much as I cannot bear the thought. I want to prepare her to hand off tasks. I am prepared to take a ""leave of absence"" if it is offered, but I cannot make any promises that I ever want to return to academia. I also have a lot of connections here on campus that I need to inform, but feel the intense desire to tell my advisor first. 

Also, I do *not* plan on telling my advisor about my suicidal ideations - I have read that this only leads to a messy situation. However, I want to make it clear that my mental health is at stake.

I am posting here because I feel helpless and completely crushed. I would like any advice at all. 

To give you a background : I defended my PhD thesis in May 2018 and since then have been working on a paper for publication without any pay or health insurance. I finally found a job that let me start on Feb 4th. A day before I was supposed to start I was told I couldn't because my advisor had not signed off on a form which is the last step to get my degree. 

After a lot of anguish and calls and emails, he said I would need a week or two more to work on the paper. After revisions are submitted and this comes around, he says it still needs more work. He then talks to my future employer and we all agree to a month more of work on the paper. That month of work ends today. He is now pushing this back further by a week, has ignored my several calls and emails literally begging him to sign on the form but he will not respond back.

The dean's office and department are involved but I am not losing another week of significant pay and having chronic health conditions not having health insurance again is another week of mental anguish. I am not sure how someone is supposed to be in the right mental state to be productive when they are treated so poorly and pushed into a corner. 

I don't want this to happen to anyone else again. Should I send an email to all the other students to warn them? What should I do about this? Any help would be appreciated. ",51,2019-03-22 21:01:26,AskAcademia

Along with constant berating, I came to realize she was only interested in publishing papers, and not ethical research. Without going into boring details, the last straw was when I fell sick. I was not allowed to come into work (since we work in a lab with 15 other people and no ventilation) as I could be infectious, and she cut my salary because I could not perform up to par during my illness. I am a graduate student, and we live mostly paycheck to paycheck. 

That is when I decided to switch advisors. Which I hoped to be a smooth transition, but turned very ugly. My ex advisor contacted me relentlessly , promised me a pay raise, no work hours, vacation time, called my parents, my girlfriend, my friend in another state to urge them to convince me. And finally sent a threatening email to my new advisor. Since we are in the same department, we decided to not make it a big deal. Picking fights with a professor is not healthy.

But now, she has started bothering me again. She wants me to help her publish papers which were my ideas and work (I have proof of concept and work) or else she will push me out of the paper and publish it on her own. I truly believe she does not have a fair and ethical attitude and I do not want to cause trouble for me or my new advisor. 

Is it worth picking a fight over this?

He started at community college and pressed forward, earning 2 masters degrees and finally a PhD from Stanford in '84 in Cultural Anthropology. He worked as an Applied Educational Anthropologist, working toward growth in migrant and bilingual education. He did this while raising a family without any outside help. 

He had 3 children and 7 grandchildren and education is his passion.  None of his children pursued higher educations, and of the 3 grandchildren who did, I'm the most formally educated. I'm 29 years old and all I've got is an associates degree. At a relatively young age I promised him that he'd see me walk with a bachelors degree. I've got maybe five years to live up to this commitment.

His struggles were very different from mine and probably much more difficult. My struggles are mostly financial, bipolar I disorder and that I'm gay and transgender. 

My major is currently Anthropology and I was going try to follow his footsteps. I've realized over time that I'm better equipped to pursue something like gender discrimination or mental health care, when it comes to social injustice.

I can't find a job that will financially support me enough to pay my bills and go to school at the same time, even with loans. Working and going to school makes growth very slow, and on financial aid, I need about 20 hrs of work weekly to survive, meaning if I shoot for my best, I'm capable of a cap of 3 courses per semester.

1. As I worked on it more, the less novel I found my work to have been and results got less conclusive.
2. I had some mental health and family issues.
3. Financial pressures made me have to get a job quicker (I had initially budgeted some time to work on this)

I am not proud of how I dealt with this however. I just ghosted an email from him asking about my progress. Then, I got locked out of my university account (expired) which can only be unlocked by going to tech support in person (I am no longer in the country).

Now, I would like to get in touch with him. I am embarrassed by my conduct despite the reasons for it. My reasons for wanting to get in touch with him are not entirely selfish:
1. I would like to have the chance to thank him for the fantastic experience I had working under him
2. I would like to apologize for my conduct
3. I would like to give him an update regarding my career (which is in the field of his &amp; my research!
4. I would like to rebuild the relationship and have him as a referee/reference for the future. (I am NOT seeking a reference in the immediate future)

Any advice on how to word my email to him to achieve these four objectives would be highly appreciated. Please note that I do not want/expect him to work with me again. I understand that that bridge is burnt. Thank you!",42,2019-02-26 15:41:37,AskAcademia
by0cwv,StefanIstas89,t2_fao5taj,A toxic academic environment. Is it normal?,"At the moment I am doing my PhD at a UK University, and am in the middle of my second year of studies.

So far, I believe I have a satisfactory progress (related to the technical aspect of my project) in programming.

Despite my overall satisfactory technical and research progress so far, I still face several hinders on progressing with my Phd at the Institution I am at the moment.

Without having to shift the blame to anyone, I feel I am struggling with my current supervisor and this has created an uncertain environment for my graduation. Although, I believe I am a very hard working person, working more than 8hours per day including weekends and this can be seen by my portfolio and all the applications I have developed so far. None of them were quite easy to be developed and it requires a lot of skills and experience.

Still my supervisor is never happy. He continuously providing me with harsh criticism to almost everything I do. Even the simplest words I use through my academic writing to describe my work and they are common sense to me but for my supervisor isn’t. I keep continuously receiving feedback and comments for my academic writing and suggestions to correct things that I cannot even imaging that they are wrong or inappropriate, as I have encountered similar academic writing to so many papers that I have read so far.

Under this harsh criticism, I haven’t been able to publish a paper yet, not because I am not working on this, but because of the continuously feedback I receive that “It’s not ready yet” by my supervisors. Maybe, it also has to do, because in part, English is not my first language.

I tried to switch supervisor internally and the new supervisor had a different mindset for my project than my principle supervisor, demanding certain terminologies to be changed, while when I shifted back to my principle supervisor, again, I had to change the terminologies based on my main supervisor’s mindset.

Additionally, my supervisor changes his mind very frequently. Among meetings, he may suggest one way of how things should proceed and at the next meeting, he may change his mind and diverge the progress trajectory. This instability has made my life miserable.

I don’t know if all the academic environments are like this, but I sense that there is an uncertainty of whether I will end up having a PhD or just waste my years in that department.

The only thing for sure is my developed algorithms and applications. Everything else, is continuously changing. Even my aims and objectives I had to revise them, I don’t know how many times until they were accepted.

Under this uncertainty and rigorous criticism, my progress has been on halt, coping with anxiety and mental health issues.

I don’t believe a PhD should be so difficult. The only difficulty in a research project should be the content and the learning procedure and apply it to meet the objectives. Everything else, like writing papers, creating portfolios, presentations for conferences and etc should be more free and not have to cope mentally or argue with my supervisor to decide how I should do those things.

Does anyone have similar experiences? Is this a typical PhD life? Should I try to change University?",41,2019-06-07 21:53:00,AskAcademia

Now that I'm serious about building a career, I want to learn as much as possible about what a potential job in academic research would be like, and how I would achieve that.

Long story short, I graduated with a BA in Linguistics. Loved every subject and got a 4.0, but virtually nothing else to show for it: no *relevant* research or meaningful networking, and no clue what I was doing with my degree. Ignorance and mental health meant I didn't take my time in college to steer that degree towards a career.

Are there any jobs in it, and who gets those jobs? What is the career path like? What areas of research should I look into? Can I make a living this way?

7seuc6,snewmy,,"Tips for dealing with the final semester of PhD? Job search, dissertation writing/defense (wedding planning too, ugh)?","Hi r/askacademia! 

First of all, thank you for any advice/wisdom/words of encouragement. I'm in the final home stretch of my PhD and a couple years ago I wouldn't believe my good luck at being where I am (I almost considered quitting after coursework was over and couldn't decide on a topic). I'm still fairly excited about my dissertation topic, I'm getting skype interviews left and right and I have an in-person interview with my ""dream school"" on Friday for a TT assistant professor gig. I'd be teaching undergraduates, which is pretty much the most fun thing I've ever done. I love it.  I have a good plan for a postdoc if these don't come through. Oh, and I've found an incredibly supportive fiance whom I love like no one I've loved before. He's even made a color-coded calendar to help me stay on track with dissertation writing. From the outside, it's all going roses and sunshine. 

Yet, I feel like I'm sort of cracking up inside. I've struggled with an anxiety disorder for my entire adult life (and probably had some childhood stuff too). For the most part, I've been pretty good at balancing all of the self-care, taking time, medication, exercise, eating well, therapy, meditation, all of that jazz throughout the PhD. I've doubled down on all of it now. But last night stress-induced insomnia hit again and I'm pretty terrified I'm going to go down the path of constant panic attacks. I'm about a third of a way through my dissertation and I honestly can't imagine sustaining this level of stress for the next couple of months. Much less the actual defense compounded with the uncertainty of what comes next. Most of me knows that this is just a stressful time for anyone, but I still feel like a bit of failure and that it's my mental health diagnosis kicking in again. 

Academics of reddit, what did you do to cope with this period? Especially those who have stuggled with this stuff before?

4yrtyk,throwaway-sh-phd,t2_10qvvo,Should I hide my self-harm scars until rotations are over? (bio PhD),"Hello. I was looking for advice, preferably from someone in a STEM field who is a professor or has a lot of experience in the environment. 

I'm starting a PhD program in less than two weeks. We are going to do rotations in labs for about 1.5 months per lab.

I have very visible scarring on my forearms and wrists from self harm and a suicide attempt. All the visible ones are not new, but not old (faded pink, all the deeper ones are over a year old). They're impossible to miss, and they're too deep and extensive to cover with makeup or bracelets. 

On the one hand, I don't want to hurt my chances of getting into the lab of my choice, and if most PIs would have significant reservations based on the scars, I'll suck it up and wear long sleeves every day for the next 6-8 months.

On the other hand, I don't want to pick a lab and then be shocked to find that my PI is completely callous about mental health issues, especially since, if I'm being realistic, there'll probably be at least one period during the next 5-6 years where my mental health issues interfere with my work. Also, I'm not going to wear long sleeves for the entirety of my PhD, and I'd rather my PI didn't feel ""duped"" and resent me for it. 

I'll mention this because it's relevant: this is at an R1 university in a ""top program."" Professors are probably, on average, less likely to be accommodating than at an R3 school, and it will be more competitive. During the interview we were told that the program tries to take care of its students once they're accepted, so that it's rigorous, but not brutally competitive within the program, and the mental health of grad students was brought up on more than one occasion, including resources and efforts to destigmatize it. This seemed to be reflected in the interactions I saw, however I know that to some extent it's too good to be true, and I like to think that my expectations are fairly realistic. I'm under no illusion that there will be hand-holding or heart-to-heart convos with my PI.

So, thoughts? You're not going to hurt my feelings. I really want honest answers, because I want to make an informed decision on this. Hell, if your opinion is ""everyone with mental illness is weak and needs to suck it up, and I'd never knowingly take on a student with mental illness"" and you're worried about downvotes, PM it to me. I really do want your honest thoughts. 

**TL;DR:** If self-harm scars would be a factor in very few PIs' decisions and perceptions, I won't cover them. If they would be a factor in many or most PIs' decisions, I'll cover them. Should I cover them? 

(final note: Yes, I know grad school puts a strain on mental health. Yes, I'm on meds and in therapy. And yes, I'm sure that grad school is the right decision for me)",37,2016-08-20 23:18:16,AskAcademia
cd7j5y,LivelyLepton,t2_3qebkkyd,Mental health + Academia --- Do things get better mentally?,"Hi all,

I've experienced a general decline in my mental health over the last 12-18 months or so while in grad school. I just finished up my second year of graduate school and I'm seeing a therapist on campus to help me through my mental health issues. 

My question for you all: With appropriate therapy/counselling as needed, has your mental health gotten better while progressing through your career in academia?

I understand that the work load probably won't change much: I expect being a professor at an R1 university will entail working \~45-50 hours per week (as I do now). I expect there will be some balance of teaching, research, applying for grants, giving talks, mentoring my students, and general department work (in most ways the similar to as I do now, with some differences). I understand that there will be pressure to publish and to take on a large workload to secure tenure...but does it get a bit easier on you mentally?

When going through days where my mental health is particularly bad, I find that my deepest, darkest worry is that I will always be struggling with my mental health as badly as I am now. Those moments are pretty scary - and it's a shame, because I really love what I do and most of work that comes along with it.

Any thoughts on the matter - or any anecdotes that you'd care to share?

8v79mg,thr02waway,,I Didn't write my Deferred Final Exams due to Depression - Petition Letter,"I am 100% sure that I've just permanently ruined my academic standing. I had to miss two of my Final exams (Last Mon and Tues), because the Doctor put me in as a ‘Formal Patient’ under the Mental Health Act and I was ‘detained’ and couldn’t leave the ER for 24 hrs. I have been experiencing serious depression and suicidal thoughts. 

I had to apply to my Faculty’s office to get both of my exams Deferred approved. They approved it and scheduled my deferred exams. One of my profs wanted me to write the exam as soon as possible so that they can finish and submit the Final grades right away (which is very understandable). I had to write both of my exam the same day, back to back - no breaks (9:00 Am - 12:00 PM 1st Exam and 12:00 PM - 4:00 PM 2nd Exam). 

I was still not feeling very well that day, I was having a mental break down while I was getting ready. I went to the designated Exam room (I was the only one there and the proctor), opened my 1st exam and thought that it was easier than the practice exams. However, I just couldn’t bring myself to think or write anything. I know that I knew the material, but I just stared at my paper for an hour before deciding to just hand it in almost blank. I thought that since I already wasted an hour doing nothing, there’s no way I’ll finish it on time so I might as well use my remainder time to get my shit together for my 2nd exam. 
I told the proctor that I will be back at 12 PM for my 2nd exam, but I never went back. I was just sitting at an empty classroom right across the exam room crying and stayed there for 5 hrs. I wanted to write that exam so bad and pass my exams, but I just couldn’t bring myself to do so. I don’t know how to explain it. I was hoping that I will be able to somehow bring myself back to write the exam. I am so frustrated with myself because I know that this is not a valid excuse and I just need to get over it.


My Accessibility Advisor (advisors for students with learning disabilities - I have a learning disability not related to depression.. Its Vision Related) advised me to apply for a back-dated Medical withdrawl (something I’ve never heard of before). However, when I was talking to the Faculty Advisor she said that she can’t really give me an advice since the only thing that I can do is write a petition letter to the dean. I was told that these are only granted under excruciating circumstances.The Advisors or Profs has no say or any power into this. After writing the letter, it’s all up to the Dean. However, I don’t even know what to write in my petition letter, because I know that I sound so petty and just using ‘Mental Illness’ as an excuse. I don’t think my reason is on the Excruciating-Level of me dying of Cancer or watching a loved-one get brutally murder right in front of me before my exam. 


Because of me failing these 2 courses, I am not sure if I can continue on with my studies. I just sabotage my future again and I am not sure what I should do next. 

How do I explain this to the Dean? Should I also include on my letter that I may have an undiagnosed Dyslexia and that I’ve just been recently referred by the government Health services for Dyslexia assessment? (It costs a lot to get these assessment done where I live and you can only get free assessment done if someone from the University referred you to get tested… then someone from the ‘government’ will interview you to determine if you qualify for a free assessment before you can get the assessment done.

3mdb2r,batmuffino,t2_6llze,Exploitation of grad students or am I just overreacting?,"Most of the phd students at our institute are in a graduate program and have to gather credit points. One of the things they have to do is organizing 'social activities', e.g. organizing colloquia, gatherings of students etc. In the last three years however this wasn't once the case and credit points are usually awarded for 'volunteering' to set up the equipment for talks and seminars or being a member of the phd representatives. Generally it's stuff that PI's / the institutes administration doesn't want to. Usually it consists of simple tasks that take max. 1hr / 2 weeks.

Yesterday however, phd students were asked by email to help with an institute seminar by:

* Coming in on the weekend for 2 days x 8 hours
* Preparing coffee, lunch, set up of beamers etc.
* Do the dishes, clean everything

The students do not take part in said seminar.

Is this normal for graduate programs? Personally I come from a background where phd students don't have graduate programs and do not need to gather credit points. Asking them to come in over the weekend to do catering for something they have no relation too would have garnered rather serious questions about ones mental health.

What would you do? Shall I talk to the person offering this 'activities' and tell him I think it's a disgrace to ask people to work for essentially free. Go directly to the program manager and ask him what the academic goal of these exercises are? Or just ask the students if they would help me wash my car and do my dishes.... I would throw in some credit points on top and even a free pizza (seriously, it's so unimaginable for me to ask for something like this I still think it's a very convincing joke). Otherwise I could just ignore it. If the phd students don't speak up why should I?

This is a somewhat personal and self indulgent post, for which I apologize in advance. I'm a first year PhD student. I've been struggling with mental illness since my very early teens, almost as long as I've wanted to go into academia. I'm in a great program and my career is on track, but I still feel like I'm treading water every day, barely able to stay afloat, and worried that it will inevitably become impossible. 

Academia and stress aren't the problem. I'd be depressed even with no external stressors. I've tried countless meds and years of therapy. At this point I've accepted that, barring a miracle cure, my life is likely to continue to be moderate depression punctuated by episodes of major depression. I take my meds and go to therapy and try to be as proactive about it as possible. My program and my research bring me some joy in addition to the stress, and I can't see myself doing anything else. 

That being said, the only discussions I see of mental health in academia are either someone who experienced an episode of depression, got treatment, and got better, or someone who left academia because it was worsening their depression. Very rarely there's a story of someone who chronically struggles with episodes of depression but is otherwise happy between episodes. 

Is there anyone out there who's made it in academia who struggles with mental health issues on a daily basis and always has? Or do people like me eventually inevitably burn out and/or not make it?

Since I am a child, joining academia has always been my dream. This is why, after finishing high school, I gladly joined the history department of a famous university in my country, and I was aiming at a Ph.D. Of course I was full of dreams and did not know what the real world was ... But I still keep an interest for academia. I still read many academic journals to stay up to date with the news, I sometimes message researchers in fields that interest me to get more information about their researches and we sometimes had interesting talks, I study all the ancient-languages required by myself (they should be studied later in my curriculum, but I decided to study them in my free time anyway), I keep a blog about my personal ""researches"" (I use """" because as you can imagine from an undergraduate in 3rd year, they are not breaking news, nor super advanced things, I just go to the library, read primary and secondary sources, learn new things, analyze them, and write on my blog about it) ... And this makes me very happy, happier and more excited than I have ever been ... And there is a but. University. Of course to get a Ph. D. I would need to spend more and more years in the university, graduating, getting a master degree and a Ph.D. , which would take me 7-8 years, probably more. And I think I cannot do it. Since my first year at the university, I have been sad and unhappy. Sometimes I can spend my entire time crying everyday for weeks, and it has been like that since the beginning. Sometimes I even become suicidal. Of course I seeked help, but it does not achieve much. It's just the idea of going to the university that makes me sick. The lectures, the homework, ... You could probably tell me that I should just deal with it and that we have all been through this, and that would probably be true, I am disappointed in myself, I see so many people about to do it, get their Ph.D. and I don't understand why I could not do it ... But the thing is, as disappointing as it is, it seems like it cannot be helped. At least what I know is that I will probably not be able to make it until the Ph.D. , but I also know that the only things that manage to keep me a bit happy are my pseudo-researches... And I want to continue to be able to do that. 


So now come my questions. Let's suppose that I just stop going to the university (something I am actually actively considering) and do a job that I would be able to stand (I have some possibilities), while keeping on doing my researches. Let's suppose I one day manage to ""discover"" (my English is not good enough, I know it is not the right word, but I don't know which one would be better) something new, what kind of credibility would I have? Would I even be able to publish that in a journal? If not, what would be your advice for someone like me?

8vryht,Sadthrowaway667,,failing my PhD,"Another 'should I quit post'... 

I'm in my 4th year of a PhD in Creative Writing in the UK. I took it because I thought it would be a good way to 'follow my passion' but continue to build a career track; I was naive.

I was fully funded for 3 years, then my stipend ran out so I transferred to part time status and have been working full time as an administrative assistant in a local firm. Luckily I'm not in debt because my fees were still funded. There's no reason for it to have taken this long. I could have finished last year and I don't have a good excuse for not doing so except I was so depressed.

The PhD requires a novel with a 20k theoretical thesis that is thematically linked. I've finished the novel but my research thesis is terrible. With 4 weeks left, my supervisor doesn't think I can finish it on time to the required standard and she is probably right. I have written only 11k and it's like reading an undergraduate dissertation. 

The only reason I haven't quit already is because I don't want to let her down. I don't want to work in academia any more and even if I did there are few jobs. I'm really depressed with how badly I suck at this and how much time I've wasted on a useless degree. I cry all the time and I don't know how I can go on.

I wanted to quit 2 years ago but after talking with my supervisor agreed to stay on. She had a lot of confidence in me and I've just let her down over and over. 

Since I have my job in administration, I could quit the PhD and apart from the time I've spent here, I would be okay. My job doesn't pay that well but it's more money than my stipend was and I really enjoy doing it. But I am my supervisor's first PhD student ever and I don't want to make her look bad. However she has lost patience with me and I think would rather terminate me at this point! All my problems are my own because I didn't communicate well with her. I didn't even tell her when my grandmother died which is what started this whole tailspin. 

Now my options are to apply for an extension, hope for major corrections, or quit. I flip between these options constantly. The toll this has taken on my mental health has been big and sometimes I worry I'm not safe. My self esteem is on the floor. I am in the university counselling which has been helping. 

What makes this worse is the feeling that it's not even a respectable degree..  while my colleagues in STEM are doing useful stuff I've achieved nothing much. I was a great student in undergraduate and during my MA, I wish I had stuck to proper research instead of trying to follow my dreams or whatever.

I think I have to scrape through to the end and I'll make it through somehow. 

Have you ever heard of anyone being terminated from the programme so close to the end?

56hi5z,1560Throwaway1614,t2_11z2pj,"1 I'm 21, I have no formal secondary-education. I didn't even finish high-school. Can I still go to university?","Hi, /r/AskAcademia. Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this.

When I was 15, my parents -- classic irresponsible hippie types, with classic irresponsible ''the *school of life* is more important than a stuffy classroom'' attitude --  pulled me out of school so that we could travel the world together. 

More recently I had some mental health issues, which meant I couldn't go to community college. But, I am an autodidact. I've read excessively for most of my life, everything from trashy fiction to academic textbooks. 

Now that i'm back in the UK and healthy enough, I would love to finally be able to go to university. Specifically, I've been looking at Brighton's BA Digital Film course and Bath Spa's BA Film, Television and Digital Production course.

My portfolio would consist of...
 
* 3 polished 3-to-15-page short stories. 
 
* A finished short-film script with storyboards. 

 
* A finished graphic-novel script with storyboards, notes, a pitch, character and location concept arts, and 3 finished pages illustrated by a professional artist. 
 

* Photographs of some costumes and props I've made, to show I can work well with textiles and materials. 
 

* some 'photographs' of scenes made in Blender.

 
* Possibly some sculpture, if my parents haven't thrown out my pottery.

I wont be able to make a film, since, having only recently returned to the UK, I don't know anybody here well enough to ask them to help me with it, so I wouldn't be comfortable with the film's final quality.

What I'm asking is: will I be able to apply for a film course in the UK as a mature student if I don't have a film or any formal schooling, provided I have a portfolio that shows I have skills relevant to the course?

Do you have any tips for applying for university as a mature student?",30,2016-10-08 15:46:08,AskAcademia
7nhrd6,staringspace,,What are your PhD/academic New Year's resolutions?,"Hi everyone,

Aside from the ""new year new me"" thing, I'm looking to set myself some goals concerning my work in academia and my PhD. This year I've struggled a bit with imposter syndrome, and I need to get my head on board with the work I'm doing and work on my mental health throughout the process. I'm interested to hear of any new year's resolutions people have made previously, or for 2018, in terms of being more productive and reducing mental stress. I'm already pretty active and I will be keeping the exercise up (a number of running races already signed up for this year!), but if there are any tips and tricks on maintaining a balanced and sane life whilst studying, I'd love to hear them!

byfih9,DoctorAteMe,t2_3fa217nm,Toxic behavior is destroying my faith in academia: what do? Does anyone actually care about this kind of thing? (Not a light read),"I am not a big reddit user, so sorry if I break any reddiquette in advance. Please let me know if I need to fix anything and/or if I should post this somewhere else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone made it through dealing with the Title IX office with a PhD and without having some sort of breakdown? Based on my experiences, and those that have been shared with me, it seems more like a place we direct people we want to systematically ignore, and they made my situation significantly worse in multiple ways. If anyone has advice for support I might not have considered seeking, I would appreciate it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't been able to see a way forward in my program since long before I was terminated in the midst of trying to file a formal title 9 complaint. The general lack of resolution and accountability since I was ""unterminated"" (except without funding for reasons no one will even give me) is hard to stomach and does terrible things to my motivation. This was never about money, earning some sort of gold star, or even a PhD for me. I just wanted to be where my nerd powers would best serve humanity, and it's painful that I cannot seem to get a straight answer about things that have made my working environment incredibly depressing and degrading.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't know how I managed to not kill myself, and if I didn't have a bunch of evidence to ungaslight myself, accomplishments, and amazing friends -- I am pretty sure I would have. Like, if my cat had died during that time: it definitely would have been game over. The system seems so broken and counter-productive, I no longer feel like this is an efficient avenue at all, and I can't help but wonder when a promising student commits suicide seemingly out of nowhere -- if they may have been going through something like I did. If people who act like the guy who bullied and slandered me can just waltz through a PhD, and people who try to confront this kind of triangulation are made to feel as unwelcome in academia as I do right now: I am actually afraid of what I have to look forward to. Being treated like some sort of hysteric for having this concern has basically just left me stuck in some sort of existential crisis, trying to figure out if humanity is even worth working to preserve if we are going to keep giving leadership positions to people who only seem to care about themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not quite ready to share my story, and I need to figure out how to pare down 14 pages and hundreds of screenshots, but I feel like I should, no matter how this plays out. I would like to be able to finish my PhD, but I can't keep sacrificing my mental health for people who share threads about dealing with toxic behavior on twitter, after actively making a toxic situation unbearable and refusing to engage about it. In retrospect, since I still can't get any examples of the behavior I was accused of by my former coworker to get this written off as an interpersonal issue, it kind of seems like my biggest mistake was trusting people who I needed to be able to trust. If my career is going to be derailed by this: I might as well try to bring attention to it. I would choose public humiliation and understanding how to avoid this in the future, over letting this go and pretending like it's OK, hands down. I have talked to so many people who have stayed quiet, because they are traumatized, ashamed, need reference letters, fought too hard to sacrifice their career, stigma, and so many other reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be shocked to hear big-name professors who went down for harassment had been making dozens of people miserable for decades, but now it seems obvious how actively we are enabling them. Former mentors and colleagues I went to for advice said things like ""he'll get a reputation, but you don't want to be the one to start it,"" and encouraged me to just power through. I'm not convinced the rumor mill is going to save anyone from people who have made their way through life by manipulating it when we silence victims in so many ways.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it like this everywhere? Is everyone in academia just too busy to care? Am I fighting to just prolong this nightmare, so I can watch this happen to other people and not be able to do anything?

&amp;#x200B;

If your first instinct is that I am just a weak, whiny person: you may be part of a systemic problem everyone loves to ignore. Feel free to test your doubts, I would love to be wrong, and I'm completely dead inside anyway, so I might as well obliterate my last shred of faith in academia (I have been trying to deal with this since 2013). 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any advice that could help me finish my PhD under these circumstances, pay for another semester, and/or share my story in a way that highlights the systemic problem that has gotta be way worse for people with less privilege without sounding like some entitled white woman: I would really appreciate it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tl:Dr:  I just wanted to study mold genetics until I died surrounded by fellow weirdos, but someone who didn't seem to care about mold or science joined the lab and started manipulating me and other people at my expense. The more I tried to rise above, give the benefit of the doubt, ask for help, or get people to confront the disturbing behavior pattern I was struggling to deal with: the worse it got. If my life is going to be derailed like this, I might as well share my story. People who know my former advisor and current dept head are going to be shocked by some of their emails and actions, but hopefully they can embrace some of that cognitive dissonance and consider the possibility this happens everywhere. I am trying to stay in academia, so I can look out for the next generation, but it kind of seems like I will just have to watch in horror if nobody cares or has any idea how to deal with this.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I'm seeing people for my crippling depression. This is not a veiled cry for help or sympathy. I don't want people to feel sorry for me. I just want to be able to make an informed decision based on data points outside of a toxic department.

I was sick with a fever and missed two classes and the last two I've missed because some days forcing myself out of bed is just unbearable, even if I'm not sleepy. The first couple times, I was on top of it and emailed my prof prior to let him know I would miss class because I was sick and asked what I missed.

I was planning on asking to meet with him the morning before our next class, so I can catch up on discussions I've missed, ask some questions about the readings, show that I'm interested in the topic, but I don't know how to go about explaining my absence. I'm tempted to just lie and say I've had the flu/fever, but who is sick for four weeks straight? Should I be honest and tell him the real reason why I missed the last two classes?

bs10d9,throwaway190218,t2_38ycfj5w,How to tell my narcissistic boss I am leaving?,"Using my throwaway for privacy reasons…

Next week, I will have to tell my boss that I will be leaving a postdoc position early. I am leaving because of him and the very toxic working environment he creates at our institution. 

I know narcissism is a word that gets thrown around a lot, however I have a strong suspicion my boss must at least be somewhere on the narcissistic spectrum. He can be a very charming person at first sight (that is also why I had no idea what I was getting myself into); yet he is also a terrible micromanager with anger issues (anything can set him off anytime, and he constantly creates problems out of non-issues), everything is always about him and nothing is ever his fault (he is also very easily offended and takes everything as a personal insult). My institution turns out to have a history of people leaving early (because of him). 

I made a lot of personal sacrifices for this position. For example, I have moved countries, while my family stayed behind. In the meantime, I am not getting any research done (I am almost two years in and still have no publication in sight, because of all the drama going on and the menial tasks my boss keeps swamping me with), my mental health is deteriorating (I suffer from a lot of stress-related issues and I feel burned-out), and my family is in another country. In other words, this job is not getting me anywhere and it is all just not worth it.

I could really use some advice on how to handle this conversation I am going to have next week. On the one hand, I want my boss to know, that I am leaving because of our toxic relationship (the mere fact that I am leaving, he will probably take as a personal insult anyways). On the other hand, I am afraid that will do me no good, as I am in a relative small field of study and he holds power (at least to some extent) over my career. Also, I am in the process of applying for other positions, but I have currently no job lined up…

17y5ml,turtledief,t2_5x5x9,academic inbreeding,"What do you think about ""academic inbreeding"" (i.e. completing a BA + PhD in the same degree at the same school)? Does it actually matter in this present day, or is this kind of fear and stigma a relic of older eras, when people didn't have efficient ways to communicate with each other?

I'm asking mainly because I have gotten offers from two of my top-choice schools. One is my undergraduate university, where I have been offered full funding; basically, I'll be set for six or seven years in the form of grants, fellowships, etc. Additionally, this university has unmatched resources in the USA and is regarded as one of the best programs, if not the best, in the world. I get along well with the faculty, and my research interests line up extremely well with my potential advisor (who is currently my undergrad advisor). She is an up-and-coming scholar in the field on tenure-track, and she (thankfully!) cares about the mental health of her students. I can't claim she is extremely well-published as she is up-and-coming, but she does good work. (Other things of note: Two profs in the department are also retiring soon and are guaranteed to be replaced by newer, younger scholars.)

As for the other university, it is also a very good place, though less so than my undergrad university! I have not received news of the funding situation yet, but as far as I'm aware, they typically cannot guarantee funding for all five years, especially for out-of-state students; I would have to renew it year after year and establish residency in the state for tuition purposes. My potential advisor there is a middle-aged, extremely well-published, world-respected and world-class expert in the field (read: hotshot). Our research interests do not line up as well, but they do intersect at down the line, and I would be very honored to study under him. I can't speak as to his temperament, not having met him yet, but I do plan to visit next month.

All in all, I'm a little torn. On the one hand, there's security (financial, mental, social). On the other, there's this better-respected advisor and the fear of ""academic inbreeding"" and how that may affect my chances of employment years down the line. The profs in my department whom I've spoken to have all told me they don't think inbreeding is a big problem, especially in light of the school's reputation and the fact they are hiring two new profs. But, well, of course they'd reassure me of that considering how much money they threw at me, and when people look at my CV, they won't see, ""Was exposed to new ideas, two profs hired during enrollment.""

95g8kz,truetrans,,"How to ""let go"" or ""fire"" an unproductive paid undergraduate researcher?","Hi.

I am about to be a 3rd year PHD student and I am faced with a difficult situation. I have an undergraduate researcher who has been underperforming all summer. She is routinely late with excuses such as ""slipped on a puddle on the way to the bus"" which I highly doubt due to both 95+ degree temperature and slipping in a puddle shouldn't cause you to lose the bus. I know she has physical health and mental health issues, but she has missed work (and often still logged hours saying she will work from home not really asking permission). The other student researcher and her are working on data entry. One day the student I wish to let go (fire) did 1 entry as opposed to 12 that the other student did. Part of their research is to do reading and report to me as I want to teach them to review articles and become minor scholars in the field as undergraduate students. She misses these constantly, and she is 3 days late on this last one. This is 9 working hours that she doesnt seem to have read or wrote a response. I already give them 3 hours to do this a week. 

She was about to take a summer class which would have left her with no working hours in the day, a convenient way for me to ""let her go"" without having to confront her. I am only a 29 year old PhD student and have never had to fire someone. She now, having really underperformed while I was away, says she will work for free and work extra and drop her summer class. This is the same tune she has sang before and I don't want her to drop her summer class. regardless I want her last day to be the end of next week. I can't imagine being able to write her a letter of recommendation. It's also hard as she is a student with a lot of adversity thrown her way. But it doesn't give her an excuse to log work hours and do nothing. 

The most awkward part is that out of my two student employees (one good, one bad) that they were both already good friends before working for me. I didn't know this was the case. So now I don't want to alienate the good employee by letting go of the other. 

Have you ever had to let someone go in your research group? How can you do this without making the whole team feel odd? How can I do this and save face? Any advice or anecdotes are welcome. Thank you all",26,2018-08-07 22:17:21,AskAcademia

School I didn't choose: UC Berkeley. Reasons: smaller solar energy program (I'm going to graduate school for solar energy). Heard that my top professor I wanted to work with required unreasonably long hours, moreso than the typical grad professor.  Thought that I might not like the Bay area.

School I chose: Arizona State University. Reason: Liked the personality of the professor here the most. Large solar energy program.

The regrets:  

1. I grew up 30 minutes away from ASU and I also did my undergrad there. I didn't think it would be a big deal deciding to come to graduate school here, as I'm not one for travelling, but I feel EXTREMELY restless now, and every morning I wake up resenting the fact that I'm essentially at the same spot as I've been my entire life.

2. My professor at ASU is new and doesn't have a lab yet.  Not to knock on him, he's an amazing guy, it just makes things harder.

3. Found out the professor at Berkeley I would have worked with is essentially doing very similar research with solar that I am doing at ASU.

4. I feel dumber and dumber every day for the fact that I got into one of the top schools in the country and decided to stay at ASU. 

All this is wrapped up in the complication that I have some mental health issues, so it's hard to trust my feelings on anything. On top of this I haven't really had friends for over 2 years now, so there's no one to talk to about any of this, hence the long Reddit post.  My parents suggest that I talk to both my professor at ASU and the one I would have had at Berkeley and be honest with them and ask about switching schools after a year. I just feel like there are so many problems with that approach. I would feel terrible about committing to a research project only to leave after a year, and who knows if Berkeley would even accept me again, especially after what will look like a failed start to grad school that would be on my resume and the fact that I turned them down already.

Even a single reply would mean the world to me.  I don't know if I should stick with my decision and try to find ways to cope with it, or if I should start the long journey to trying to switching schools, with the possibility that it will backfire horribly and sour my good relationship with the professor I'm currently working with. 

Edit: Just realized that anyone from my grad program will easily be able to tell this is me. A little awkward, but I don't care I guess. Hey guys! :D Your advice is welcome as well!

Basically, if you are a resident of Texas and you're at least 10 years removed from your coursework, you can go back to school for a new degree, and the GPA of the classes 10 years ago would be as if they don't exist. One could use this as a stepping stone for admission to Texas's graduate programs (but only for those in Texas).

I personally like this idea. I've seen a lot of threads in /r/gradadmissions about people having low GPA's due to mental or physical health issues, family issues, financial issues, or just immaturity, and resolving these issues to end up with higher GPA's for the last few years. Yet due to the previous failures, their cumulative GPA is doomed to be low, and this would hurt greatly their chances to get into good grad programs. I don't think that these people should be penalized for their past failures, especially if it was such a long time ago and they have proven their academic ability eventually.

* If you stayed in a similar field, but just moved to industry or lower academic position, did you have any concerns about future potential work-related interactions with faculty / academics from the school you left? (Even if you didn't majorly ""burn bridges"" and left with dignity.) The issue of reputation as a professional in the field, essentially.

* Did you ever go back into academia / a doctoral program at a different institution later on? 

* Your feelings now on the decision? Was it right at the time, anything additional you wish you would have evaluated before taking the leap,...?

Open forum on this topic, all comments are welcome! Cheers!

58bgd0,helloitsathrowaway1,t2_11xysc,[update] undergrads with mental illnesses,"(again, sorry for bad English, I'm not a native speaker)

A while ago I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/569lnt/undergrads_with_mental_illnesses/). Thank you all for your comments.

Last week, PI expressed concern because I looked unwell again, so he did the usual ""have you been sleeping properly, have you eaten more than one meal today, etc"" thing. I told him that I have been ""sick"" which he thought meant a cold or flu, but I explained that it is a long-term illness. He asked me what it was but I said I'd rather not. I also explained that I'm not asking for any accommodations or special treatment or advice or responsibility reductions, but I am only sharing as an explanation of my performance and weird habits. I've also shared the exact same information with three other profs that I trust after they've asked me about my health, including his spouse, who is another one of my profs this term.

All of them were incredibly kind and expressed concern for my well-being. They strongly encouraged me to prioritize my health over school and work, and said that I can ask for help any time. The profs whose class I'm taking now said that they would understand if I couldn't do readings here and there. I assured them that wouldn't be necessary. Two of them guessed that it's something to do with stress (PI's spouse's first suggestion was therapy, unfortunately this means she knows) and PI has alluded to or explicitly discussed mental illness with/around me before, so he probably has assumptions too. In any case I am still having trouble taking care of myself- eating, sleeping, social situations, focusing on exam preparation and ""being present"" are very difficult for me. Out of respect for them and their time, I won't ask for any help though they have offered it. I explained that I can handle it myself, and that as an adult and a student at a top-20 R1 institution I have an obligation to handle it myself, and that I don't want to be even more of a burden on them. Hopefully this helped them understand that I am not trying to be manipulative or clingy or make excuses for incompetence.

That being said, I regret telling them anything, because now they probably feel the need to be very careful around me and treat me like a fragile cry-baby instead of an adult and an aspiring professor. They likely only said kind things out of obligation/politeness. I might even lose my RA job. I don't know what to do now and I have no one to turn to. I should distance myself further from faculty, but I don't know how to do that without making them think I resent/distrust them or hurting my chances of getting good letters and continuing a mentor relationship during/after my undergraduate degree.",21,2016-10-19 17:12:43,AskAcademia
3enr9j,Paradiddle234,t2_p33go,Seriously considering leaving my PhD program - advice?,"I am 4 years through a 6 year PhD program in Biology from a big name school. I'm an international student on an F1 visa, so I moved to the US specifically to complete this program.

Four years down and I am desperate to leave. My physical and mental health have both suffered due to the stress of the program and also a difficult relationship with my advisor, and my productivity has slowed to a halt. At my current rate of data generation, I'm afraid that I won't have enough to satisfy my committee and graduate two years from now. I'm not enjoying the project, and the thought of switching to a new project with the same advisor makes me feel depressed and anxious. The rest of my lab is wonderful - I would be really sad to stop working with my colleagues, but I have worked very very hard on trying to find a synergistic relationship with my advisor, and frankly I've lost my trust in this person. I'm very resentful of many past events and the style in which my advisor chooses to ""advise"", which is very controlling and critical.

I've learnt that I want to work in science but the kinds of jobs I want are typically advertised at the Masters level. I want something 9-5-ish, field is flexible. I am very motivated by feeling useful and by working in close collaboration with other scientists (I think part of the struggle I've had with PhD is that I don't enjoy the solitude of being solely responsible for completion of my project). I'm happy to work overtime occasionally but I want to have evenings and weekends to myself, for the most part. 

So! If I left, I would have a Masters in Biology from a big name school, and plenty of experience (4 years from PhD work + 4 years research experience prior to this). I am confident that I could have a fulfilling career without a PhD. My major issue is that I don't want to leave the city where I'm currently in school! It feels like home now. But I'm dependent on my student visa. I would be able to apply for OPT extension of my visa after graduating with a Masters, I believe, but this extension lasts at most two and a half years. I believe my only other options are:
-H1B visa, of which there are a limited number available per year.
-Green card by employment sponsorship, which AFAIK is typically only offered to employees who have been working at a company for a number of years.
-Green card by Diversity Visa Lottery, which of course is luck of the draw. I'm from a country that is eligible and has a relatively high rate of winners per number of entrants, though.
-Green card by marriage. My partner is a US citizen but marriage isn't on the table right now, and I don't think either of us really like the institution of marriage anyway. And of course marrying someone does not guarantee that a green card application will be approved.

I'm seeking advice from my department and career services at my school, but I would love advice from anyone who has the time and inclination to provide it. Thank you!

My PhD in no way contributed to my breakdown, and I've said it over and over again throughout the last month that I think it's the only part of my life that isn't a massive pressure point for my mental health. 

I've not returned to university since _the incident_ so I'm no longer studying, or working at the university. My income has dropped from a steady £600 a month to nothing and we definitely needed that money to keep our house ticking over so that's another huge factor.

I have no idea how to come back after this, either financially or practically and I've never felt so far away from getting my bloody literature review actually completed. I'm almost embarrassed to return and I have the added bonus of absolute word soup when trying to communicate, which isn't exactly fitting of a doctoral student. Describing cheese as ""hard milk"" hasn't been my finest moment.

8xvhir,hellohello2204,,Why don't people liken the difficulty of getting into a Ph.D. program to the difficulty of getting into Med School?,"I, like many others, was under the impression that hard work and determination (and good grades and lab experience) was enough to get into Ph.D. programs.

I've since switched focus to a career in health care/mental health for a better work life balance, while keeping the creative/problem part of myself alive. Still, so many people ask me why I ""gave up on my dreams."" They seem to think good grades and some lab work is enough. They also don't understand the dedication involved in being an academic if you \*do\* graduate and get a job. (A job, AKA 2-3 post docs, an adjunct position, then maaaybe TT, etc).

76qsk4,swagever,,Struggling to keep up with research demands due to poor mental health. Advice please?,"Hi there,

Not sure if this is the right kind of topic for this sub, but I thought I’d try to reach out for some help here anyway. 
This year I started my honours thesis as an undergrad. I enjoy my research topic as it’s something I’m passionate about and because of this it wasn’t a project that was handed to me on a plate by the professor I approached to supervise me. I’ve wanted to pursue research ever since I started uni and I’ve worked my ass off to get to the GPA I have today.
This year has also been the hardest year of my life and I was diagnosed with severe depression and an anxiety disorder as a result, so naturally this threw a major spanner in the works and it completely inhibited me from being able to work well. 
When I hit rock bottom, I reached out to someone within the uni who contacted my supervisors and explained the situation on my behalf, and everyone including the faculty I’m in agreed that I needed to take some time off uni to get some professional help. So I did.
I’ve been keeping up with therapy and I decided to recommence my honours project half way through this year (semester 2) and thus finish mid year next year as opposed to the end of this year.
As cliche as it sounds, the road to recovery has definitely been harder (and slower) than I expected and trying to deal with uni again has been difficult while trying to get myself back on track. 
The problem is other than awkward small talk, I’ve never really had the chance to have a serious conversation with my supervisors about my situation. When I recommenced at the beginning of this semester it was business as usual with my supervisors and I’d receive the awkward ‘how’s things?’ thrown in the mix of conversation about my thesis. I’ll also add that at the time even my friends and family didn’t know that was going on so it was impossible for me to open up to my supervisors...
Fast forward a few months to now and I’m still struggling to make significant progress (the amount I’d hope to be making - yay perfectionism) with my thesis and it’s causing some issues with my supervisors... such as them thinking I’m not putting in enough effort or that I’m prioritising other things such as work over uni when this is certainly not the case as I’m truly trying my absolute best to keep up. 

I guess what I’m trying to get at here is that I feel completely trapped between uni and my personal life and I don’t know how to reach out for help. My supervisors obviously know that I’ve been dealing with some things but their reaction to it all has been completely indifferent which has made me feel even more inferior and not good enough for them or for research. 

Im scared of being unprofessional and painting myself as an incapable student if I tell them that I’m still struggling but doing the best I can and that they just need to bare with me. 

I’m sorry that this is such a long read, but I’m hoping someone can give me some advice as to what I should do? Perhaps someone that’s gone through a similar situation or has dealt with a student that hasn’t known how to ask for help in fear of being unprofessional or seen as a burden? I know academics aren’t these untouchable beings that only care about their students results... but it sure feels like that right now.

Thank you for reading. Even if no one replies this has helped getting it off my chest.

7aay05,UncharacteristicAge,,UC Berkeley admission(sociology major) got rescinded because professor refuses to hear me out and the school neglected to help me knowing this was a time sensitive matter. Is there anything I can do? I'm desperate. I worked so hard and now I feel hopeless and worthless.,"Hi everyone, 
I am completely hopeless as I write this and am in desperate need for advice. 

I'll give a little background of myself [20/F]. I am a sociology major who has/is worked/working very hard to prove to her very middle eastern parents/ that there is more to life than just choosing the medical or engineering route. 

I have gone out of my way not to only build my college applications to stand out, but also make a difference in my community in any way I can. I volunteered over 500+ community service hours JUST in high school when the minimum was 20. I started a nonprofit, helped out in countless fundraisers &amp; really put my blood, sweat and tears into getting to my dream schools, which were UC Berkeley &amp; UCLA. I was lucky enough to be admitted to both schools. 

 A prerequisite to applying for sociology was Statistics 1. Now I have to tell you, math was never my strong suit &amp; I took it 5 times. 

The first time I took it, I dropped it because of my mental health issues(severe depression &amp; anxiety). 

The second time I took it, I failed(with an F) the semester before I was applying. I froze on the final exam despite knowing the material well. The final was also going to replace another exam I had previously missed due to having a panic attack that day.

The third time I took it, I took it over a 5 week session in which I got into a car accident and had to drop it because I ended up missing a week in which I missed out on materials needed in order to pass the class. 

The fourth time I took it, which was literally a semester before I was transferring. I had no other choice, but I knew I had to pass this class no matter what. I mean, it hurt my educational ego a bit that I still wasn’t able to pass this after attempting this so many times. 

So I took the class, and according my calculations, I was supposed to end up with a C (which was also part of my conditional offer; to finish the semester with a 3.0+ and pass statistics with a C or better).   
 I did everything, got a C in the class, participated in my graduation ceremony from CC and was so relieved that I could go on and transfer to Berkeley(I chose Berkeley because it ranked #1 in sociology). However, two days after graduation, I got an email from my professor saying my friend and I plagiarized and that she was taking away points for the assignment, all my extra credit points and a grade replacement which dropped my grade to a D. 

What had happened was my friend and I turned in an identical lab because we had worked on it together on Google Docs, which wasn’t prohibited nor mentioned in the syllabus. It was not an exam or quiz, it was simply just a lab assignment, which everyone in class usually collaborated with one another and submitted. My friend and I were not told, nor did we think it was the wrong thing to do. My professor just assumed we cheated and refused to talk to us about the issue, failed to reply back to our emails to meet, and the only thing she said it was my right to contest her decision and file a grade dispute which both my friend and I did.
We have a list of witnesses who were actually present when we did the assignment to account for the fact we did not cheat, possible video recordings of us working together at the school’s tutoring lab and cafe, and even numerous professors and faculties to vouch for our academic integrity.  
We were called to the dean's office since the professor filed an academic dishonesty case against us. We told the dean what had happened and he believed us on what had happened and cleared us of any disciplinary action. However, he said there was nothing else he could to do help us. Though, he did advise me to take the class over once again. He said the professor is a very difficult person to reason with(also called her an ass) and they've had issues with her before which she was very unhelpful. He also said knowing her, she's quite adamant on not wanting to change our grade.

 He told us we could still contest her decision but did not tell us how. That was his way of indirectly trying to save his ass(according to other faculty members I've spoken to about this issue). Thus began our wild goose chase. We bounced from one place to another and hit many dead ends. No one gave us any guidance or any clear instructions for how to go about this. 

 As a result, my offer from Berkeley was rescinded and my life completely shattered into dust. 
 After weeks and weeks of running around to the president, the vice president, the dean, and countless faculty/professors, it was then made clear to us that since it happened during summer, they didn't do anything about it until 2 months after. 

I took the stats class during summer right after I was informed that has happened just in case the grade dispute didn't go in my favor, which I'm glad I did, because after weeks of waiting to hear back, I received an email stating they didn't approve of a hearing and dismissed my case without letting me even advocate for myself and explain what had happened. 

 I am a first generation student and my parents didn't believe in me until after I got into Berkeley. I worked my entire life to get to where I wanted yet because of a professor who is unwilling to let us justify what actually happened and a school's neglect, my admission got taken away from me. I have never been more disappointed in my entire life. This incident sent me into severe depression and completely derailed my life. 


Is there anything I can do to get my admission back?  Is there anything I can do in general at this point? I don't know if I can recover from this. I worked so hard and can't help but feel it was all for nothing.

478rx9,fuckyoulymedisease,t2_ulkds,How do I know if a Ph.D is the right track for me (as opposed to a master's)?,"I've always partially wanted to do a Ph.D, but it seemed like a silly pipe dream, since I worked two, occasionally three jobs while going to school full time as an undergrad, so research wasn't an option for me. I did TA for three semesters because I could get away with telling my bosses it was a class so they usually respected that. Now I've been out 9 months working an awful, shitty, horrible full time job that got me put on Prozac because I hate it so much. 

Going back to school is my only way out, so I decided to accelerate my go-back-to-school-someday plan. I was just going to bite the bullet and take out loans for a master's, just to get away from this job, but I was talking with a former advisor who suggested I go all the way to a Ph.D since I had excelled at the research work in the class and I had a solid overall GPA, excellent major GPA, and got a 164V 154Q on the GRE, plus he knew my economic situation and that I had a chance of getting a stipended position if I did a Ph.D instead. It wasn't an offer or anything, nor would I pursue that route, as his classes were outside of my primary interest and I have no desire to return to my undergrad alma mater, but it got me thinking. I did my undergraduate degree in counseling and human services with a concentration in social policy, and I want to pursue health psychology, specifically the psychology of the American work culture and its effects on physical and mental health. I've found a few programs that are a good fit for me, but how do I know if I'm actually smart enough or talented enough or even passionate enough to pursue a Ph.D? 

I'm not dead set on going into academia, as what I really want to do is research and I don't care who's signing the check, whether its a university or a hospital or the US government, so the scary stats about tenure-track jobs don't bother me too much.How on earth do I decide what to do?

3v2bpr,WeAreAll14443,t2_sln2q,Considering moving on before finishing my Ph.D.,"I'm writing as a frustrated doc student who has written out posts like this many times over the past two years only to pull them back &amp; continue my misery due to perceived pressure from friends/family/fear of failure.  

I am in year #3 of my PhD program with the earliest possible completion being August 2016, I am not ABD, nor all that close. I have dealt with a form of depression throughout my experience and have went to counseling to handle some of the effects. I have now gotten to the point where I no longer feel motivated or really care about the process. I recently failed to meet a major deadline, and I can't come up with any other time that has happened in my academic career. And now since that, I have lost all ability to formulate anything of value. 

I wrote on here once about how I could possibly deal with learning that I am heavily teaching-focused after I entered a research program at an R1 with a high level research load (thanks to a fellowship that was given to me without requesting it). That feeling has only grown since that post 18 months ago. I have struggled to meet research deadlines consistently, and my health/mental state has suffered in the process. 

My advisor and I have had a terrible relationship due to our polarized feelings on education. It's a dynamic that my close friends have heard countless stories about and wish I could leave to get away from for my sanity. In a meeting this summer with the department head, I was told I probably shouldn't have been a candidate for the fellowship at such a high research school. (Thanks for the confidence boost....)

My dissertation, while something I do have some level of interest in, has slowly fallen apart. I attempted to put together my proposal &amp; quickly realized I had no idea what I was doing. To put the icing on the cake, I got an email from an organization that previously told me they were interested in using my dissertation research to compile a database, that they are now basically compiling the data by themselves, with more detail than I have planned on doing. This basically means my research is possibly obsolete as of 24 hours ago. I was already in the middle of writing this before I got that email.

In the end, I am way too focused on education and my students to be in this setting. I recently went on a campus job interview at a smaller school, and while I enjoyed the experience, I can't help but say I felt out of place. I spent an hour talking about my research/dissertation experience, pretending it was the most important part of my CV, yet they only gave me 20mins to give a lecture to students.

While none of you know me, the most painful thing right now was being blasted by my peers a few weeks ago for my teaching style, including that I care too much about their problems, and how not having exams is hurting them. My peers in the program have all proposed in the past month, and are moving full speed ahead, while I have fallen behind. I probably shouldn't care, screw them blah blah blah. It still hurts. 

So a tl;dr of sorts, I am trying to decide if getting out of this toxic experience is worth exploring, while potentially moving into a job that fits my interests (i.e. advising, or as an adjunct). Thanks for any and all advice or kind words I may get out of this. We all need some guidance at times.   ",17,2015-12-01 23:01:55,AskAcademia

47z5eb,ApplesROranges,t2_vqjd5,Advice for 3rd year Physics PhD?,"  Hi all, not sure if this is the right place to post, but I’m at a point in my phd where I need some advice. I’m a third year physics phd student at a top 100 physics program, and I’m ABD. Now that I’ve made it through the formalities and basics (core classes, qualifier exam, becoming literate in my field), I’m at a point where I need to focus in and decide how the remaining 3-4 years of my phd experience will be structured, what skills I want to develop, and what kind of person I want to be at the end of my phd.    
  This is a complex decision though, because I’m navigating around a variety of concerns and problems. I think my biggest fear is graduating without any employable skills. My second biggest fear is the possibility of completing my phd and having completely lost my identity, having sacrificed all of my time and energy towards the pursuit of knowledge and productivity. I want to be employable, but I still want to be a “real person” and have hobbies, interests, and passions.    
  With regards to my first concern, employability, I’m studying nanoscience: particularly projects related to spintronics, nano-optics, and magnetism. I chose this field (and advisor) because it seemed relevant to the world of next-generation electronics, an industry that is vast and will keep growing as nanofabrication methods continue to advance. Also, I have never planned on pursuing academia after graduate school, for a number of reasons. I have experience in nanofabrication, high-vacuum technology, and electronics (though electronics is my biggest weakness). I don’t have much experience coding. I know very basic Labview, matlab, and python but haven’t spent much time with them.  I’ve also struggled with imposter syndrome since I began graduate school, which is know is super common. I’ve done well enough in my courses (B+ average) but don’t feel fluent in quantum mechanics at all. I guess generally I feel like I passed the exams, but don’t necessarily have enough mastery of the subjects to teach them to someone else, which I think is the truest test of understanding. 
  My second concern is based on my life outside of the lab. I want to succeed academically, but don’t want to commit the entirety of my waking life to my work. I feel like the older graduate student in our group has become little more than a breathing research instrument, working weekends and constant late nights. He has a decent publication record and is good with hands-on work, but doesn’t have friends, hobbies, or social skills.     
  The reason this concerns me is because I’ve definitely felt my social skills diminish since I’ve joined the lab and even though I try to make time for myself outside of the lab, anxiety, depression, and fatigue have made it difficult to enjoy myself or pursue things that make me happy. I’ve set up an appointment with a therapist, and a lot of my mental health issues aren’t a result of my work life.    
  So, with all that being said, I recently went to a job recruitment talk from Intel and a striking point that they emphasized was that they were less interested in the specific things that students learned in their phd, more covetous of the general skills that a phd graduate possesses: attention to detail, being able to break problems down into their most basic parts, determination, creativity.    
  This was kind of encouraging to me, because while I have specific gaps in my education, I’m on track to have 3-5 publications by the time I graduate, 2-3 of which will be mostly my own work, so I’m definitely developing all of the soft skills that the recruiter was talking about. Furthermore, I’m not hard set on the industry of electronics and computing, and this made me feel like I’ll have more options coming out of graduate school as a result of the general skills that I’ll develop through my work as a graduate student. For one, I’m passionate about food and cooking, so food science interests me. After talking with this Intel recruiter, I feel as though my lack of background in biology and chemistry may be less of a barrier for entry into the food science industry than I originally thought.    
  **Do you have any advice for someone in my shoes? Is the only way to assure employability by committing as much time as possible to my work? Should I try to fill in all of the perceived gaps in my education? Would I more successfully broaden my job options after graduating by increasing the breadth or depth of my skillset?**    
  I’ll obviously talk with my advisor about some of these issues, but also wanted some input from other people. Thanks and sorry for the wall of text!

7sm1zb,NoxiousQuadrumvirate,,Disclosing mental illness to supervisors,"[Australia / Astrophysics / Honours]

I'm in Honours currently, officially moving into my office on Monday. I also have schizophrenia. 

One supervisor has said that even 20 years out of his Honours year, he'd still consider it the most stressful year of his life, so I know I'm in for a tough time for the next ~9 months. Normally I'd just supply my disability accommodations for exams (as I did for my undergraduate degree) and leave it at that since the risk is so low for a spontaneous decline, but I think the stress of this year changes the rules a bit. Also, considering my condition is not something many people will typically have experience with, I think an open discussion between us could help. Descriptions online are not forgiving towards the illness, and many describe something far more debilitating than I experience. 

I already have a full support team that I meet with on a weekly basis, and in light of all of the warnings for stress, I've changed my medication routine so that I no longer have much autonomy over it (regular supervised injections instead of pills). I pay people to keep tabs on my cognitive functioning and to intervene if it changes, so I don't expect any of the university staff to take on any significant role. The only real risk would be an incredibly fast decline in functioning, and it'd be very obvious that I wasn't well. In that case the university policy would be to contact my health provider, but I feel like they should be aware of it beforehand just so they don't call the police (I'm not violent), and so they're not completely unprepared.

How much does prestige of grad school matter?,"I'm getting my PhD in chemistry, and I hope to become a professor at a liberal arts college. I have been accepted to three schools. One is top tier, one is mid tier, and one is bottom tier. (All three are RU/VH.) I'm having a hard time with the decision, and I need some insight. 

- I want to be close to family:
Bottom tier school is 30 minutes away. It's in my home state. I would be happy to teach at some of the schools in my home state.

- Research is not the most important thing in my life:
I am not a workaholic. I will not stay awake thinking about my work until the wee hours in the morning. The top tier school is a pressure cooker, and I'm more likely to have mental health issues if I go there. Mid tier is slightly more laid back, but it's still grad school. 5th year grad students at the bottom tier school said that 40-50 hours a week is the norm. It is a very relaxed department.

- I want to like the research at least a little:
Top school is amazing. Everything is awesome. Funding and resources are not even a little bit of an issue. 
Mid school has cool stuff happening. I would be happy doing that work.
Bottom tier school has only one professor I would want to work for, and even that research wasn't that exciting to me.

**tl;dr** I would go to a bottom tier school if I could be guaranteed the job I want at a liberal arts college. Leaving my family makes me sad, but I feel I may have no choice for the sake of my career.

b9fq4b,AdmiralLunatic,t2_bhxd192,To switch or not to switch... when it comes to advisors,"Here's the background:

I'm an international student who originally came to the US to pursue my Master's. After a semester, I realized that I really want to a PhD, and some of the professors I had been talking to advised that its better to switch to PhD, since a Master's is ""not essential"", and that I'd be saving more time that way. 

Around the same time, my current advisor came to know about my interests, and he as well was looking for a PhD student. We talked a few times, and I eventually decided to switch from the very next semester. Being new to the whole US educational/academic system, I did not know what to look for in an advisor. 

Being someone who switched to academia recently from the industry, he did not have any first-authored publications on his resume, and I did not think too much about it back then. He asked me to explore certain fields, and to try and find a research problem. Unfortunately, his suggestions were way too broad, and being new to this, I ended up spending my first six months trying to do literature review.

Enter his new post-doc. Now this is when things started to change. Within a couple of months of this post-doc joining, I learned more about how to do research and the importance of evaluating novelty of ideas before we started on something. This wasn't something that I felt my advisor was focusing on. I started to see the difference between an academic researcher (the post-doc) and someone from the industry (my advisor). As opposed to the post-doc, my adviser wasn't as much concerned about triviality, novelty and perception of the academic community. He wanted to find something interesting and important and to do research on that topic.

Soon after that, I started assisting the post-doc on different projects and I started to learn how to see things differently. I realized that I'd need his assistance more to succeed in my PhD with better publications. Unfortunately he left after a year, but he still assists me to this day.

With my advisor, we finally ended up focusing on a field of research. However, being in inter-disciplinary research between CS and social sciences, he often gets swayed to the ""other field"" rather than the one in which I can get papers in. His ideas are way broad and out of reach compared to our capabilities and focus. I've had to argue for hours to make him understand that we'll be setting ourselves up for failure if we focus on vague interpretations and ideas. And whats worse, it seems that I had been chasing a ghost when it comes to research. Its been 3.5 years and I don't have a single paper to show. In my field, that's extremely uncommon (with students publishing up to 1-2 papers a year).

If you're wondering why I haven't switched advisors yet, its because hes an excellent human being. I say this because I haven't been the ideal PhD student either. I've had to deal with multiple mental and physical health issues in this 3.5 years and ended up taking a 5 month break. He was supportive of all this and always helped me get through it all. He even stopped me from dropping out at the worst phase, and gave me room to think about it through. And if it wasn't for that, I would've dropped out a two years ago.

You see, I'm in a dilemma. I'm afraid I might not have the qualifications for industry or academia if I follow down this path, but at the same time, I really don't want to change advisors. What would you have done if you were in my shoes? What advise do you have for me?",15,2019-04-04 17:30:59,AskAcademia

I graduated spring 2016 with a degree in Christian Studies from a regionally accredited religious institution. I did not learn any ancient or foreign languages and was not very involved with the campus life or extracurricular activities (due to mental health issues). I am currently looking at graduate programs 1 year later and am trying to access what my options are. I have no desire to go to seminary, seeing as my interest in theology/religion is academic. I have been looking at some religious studies programs, (ASU, and UNC) but would also be interested in studying theology as well. 

Ultimately, I am concerned that I am not an attractive applicant for any program. I did not know my professors well and thus have poor references. I do not know french, German, Hebrew, or Greek. And somehow after four years of college I do not have a writing sample that exceeds 10 pages (I am worried that I do not have any at all backed up seeing as my laptop was stolen). With that being said I am extremely interested in religion and theology and would be more then happy to study almost any facet of the  two at any institute that would take me. I am just worried that I will have trouble getting accepted almost anywhere. The one saving grace of my undergrad is that I graduated with a 4.0, however I realize that is probably not very important in comparison to writing samples and references. 

I was wondering if anyone could point me toward what types of programs I should be looking at, if I am primarily interested in religious studies, theology, and philosophy of religion. I have been looking at programs online, but am uninformed as to which are more competitive and ultimately which I would have a chance of being admitted to.

Would it be knowledge worth having?**

(sorry for bad English – not a native speaker)

I'm an RA for a professor (not STEM, so no lab, and I'm the only RA there who does anything substantive, ie more than just data entry – we've coauthored a paper, etc). I'm an undergraduate and I've been mentally ill since ~13 years of age. That being said, I've managed to do extremely well in school, getting a full ride to my current university, getting this RA job, keeping a 3.7+ GPA, doing independent research on the side. I'm also good at my job – I've had it for a couple of years already, I complete tasks on time/ahead of time, I put in maximum effort, and the professor praises me often both in front of me and to other faculty when I'm not around. There's always room for improvement, but still. Besides that, he's somewhat of a mentor to me, helping me navigate graduate school applications (different, but related, field); I know his family and they've had me over for holidays and such. Sometimes he asks me about my family and upbringing, which were horrible as I was abused as a child. I've kept my responses short and vague every time, so he doesn't know anything other than that I don't talk to one parent at all anymore and limit my interactions with the other.

I've been even more stressed out than usual lately, and he can tell. He knows I'm not eating regularly or sleeping properly. Last month, he even went so far as to somewhat nonchalantly ask me if I had recently had a panic attack after I mentioned being worried about something. As far as I know, my condition hasn't affected my performance at work, and my grades are the same as they've always been. I'm worried that he might already be drawing negative conclusions about me. *Given that this might be the case, should I mention my mental illness in vague terms? Is it worth the risk at all?* Of course I won't say ""mental illness"" at all, more something along the lines of  ""I have been dealing with some health issues for a while, but I'm still trying my best at school and at work, and I don't have any additional expectations of you,"" etc. I want to preserve, or even improve, what is already a good relationship, and I don't want the professor to think I'm incompetent or dangerous or weird (projecting childhood hang-ups, etc)",15,2016-10-07 04:08:54,AskAcademia

be1eu1,8261049375,t2_3m2pbgqt,Returning to an institution after 8 Years,"Hi, /r/askacademia 

This is a throwaway account for reasons that will become clear in a moment. 

As an undergrad, I was reasonably accomplished, and entered my institution's 5th year BA/MA program when my post-senior year plans fell through. However, in that last year, my sister became gravely ill, and had to be institutionalized against her will. It tore my family apart, and my mental health with it. (There are only so many times you can take your mother sobbing on the other end of the phone about how she doesn't want to bury her child.) 

I had a major depressive episode, and turtled, HARD -- I holed up in my apartment, stopped going to class, and at one point I didn't speak to another human for almost a week. I ended up getting an incomplete for all my classes that semester, and while I tried to make up the work, it was just too much to do. I left without completing the MA. 

Now, nearly eight years later, things have changed. I got married, taught at a university abroad, and have vastly improved my mental health. I've applied -- with support from some mentors -- to graduate study. There are only four universities in the USA that offer the Master's program I'm looking for, and my alma mater was one of them. I was accepted, with full funding at my alma mater, and with less funding or no funding elsewhere, so I'm returning. 

At one level, the obstacle has been overcome -- after a proper master's degree, my previous failure 8 years ago becomes less relevant to doctoral admissions committees, and clearly my interim work was good enough to get a scholarship. 

However, there remains the matter of ruptured relationships. Three of the four scholars I ghosted that semester are still at the school, and at Admitted Students Weekend (which I attended), one was on a faculty panel. I shook her hand afterward, and after telling me that I looked familiar, I told her my name. The look of shock on her face was… something. She said she was grateful that I was resuming my studies. I'm now writing thank you notes to everyone I met at the weekend, hers is the last one, and I've got nothing.

So, /r/askacademia , do you have any words of wisdom, or any advice? It's weird to be an eight-year prodigal son, but I don't know how to approach these scholars. I want to apologize, I want to get back to work, I don't particularly want to discuss the past, I don't want to have permanently burned bridges.

I am a 4th year PhD student in the US who suffers from anxiety and Major Depressive Disorder.

On return from medical leave, which in retrospect was too soon, the same interference and panic attacks started to happen again.  I found much better medical care than I had previously been utilizing (which was not covered by my insurance because our school only offers us very limited mental health options which I did not find to be adequate) and my doctors suggested I take another medical leave.  This time the request was denied due to this being my second ""failed"" attempt (""failed"" is in quotes because neither attempts were ever completed due to my deteriorating mental health at the time).  I have been trying to deal with this through my university since January, when the provost informed me that my program is not actually allowed to grant medical leaves or returns themselves and it must go through the university's student services office.  Upon contacting this office, they have said they can help figure it out, but have been extremely slow and I still have no idea what is going on with anything.  

There are more places where I believe my university has acted with negligence, including the head of my program informing me that my first medical leave was granted at a seminar in front of all of my peers, my advisor insisting I disclose details of my mental health to my entire committee despite me letting her know that it made me uncomfortable.  There is also a somewhat unrelated history of the head of my program making extremely mysogonistic comments to me in particular and to entire groups at seminars.
I am not really sure what legal grounds I might have for any sort of case.  I feel like I have been discriminated against for my mental illness.  I feel like the whole ordeal, and the length of it all has greatly increased my mental suffering.  I feel like even if they do grant me a leave now, after missing an entire semester trying to figure this all out, I will not be able to return to finish my degree resulting in lost wages for the near future, but much more so for my cumulative income.

Because of all that, I feel like even if I rock the GRE, it won't matter much because I'll like need at least another year or two of real experience to prove to any admission committee that I'm worth it. (Addendum 2- I *do* have a plan for that ""bridge time"". without a full class load I'm very confident in my ability to work part time and do research in a lab to get me up to speed)

So, should I even bother with the GRE? I'm actually looking forward to the exam to see how I do, and I know I could always take it now and retake it later when I'm ready to apply, but I don't want to waste time/money that could be better spent getting me up to speed ASAP.

905pmu,Sassiopeia123,,I'm applying for a very prestigious graduate scholarship. Should I mention that I have schizophrenia?,"I don't really know where else to turn with this question. My mental health team didn't think I'd be able to finish high school let alone undergrad, so they don't believe in me for anything. My professors have never seen this kind of situation play out so they (all 2 people who know) really have no idea either. I have a meeting with the national coordinator for the scholarship tomorrow and I could ask her, but I also need her sponsorship to even go into the running, and I don't want to sabotage it.

We have to write a personal statement, and everywhere I look, it says to ""be yourself"" and ""talk about things that matter to you"" and ""tell us who you are"". A big part of who I am today is caught up in the illness that robbed me of my later teen years. I don't need it to explain away any poor grades or gaps in education, so I could leave it out and no one would know, but maybe my essay would be weaker. But then again, schizophrenia is highly stigmatised and I'll be labelling myself as a risky choice, and there's the risk that if I got accepted then my private diagnosis would become very, very public. 

I guess I'm wondering just how open-minded the scholarship committees really are.",10,2018-07-19 13:10:55,AskAcademia
5bs909,wayfaringstranger11,t2_12nhet,I'm worried that I chose the wrong field for pursuing my interests and not sure what to do next (Humanities: literature/modern languages/cultural studies),"TL;DR: Sorry for the wall of text.  My basic concern is that after a year and a half in my program I'm starting tohave the distinct feeling that I chose the wrong field or the wrong program for my research interests and am not sure what to do next.  Does anyone have tips for how to express these concerns (or whether I should at all) to the faculty in my department?

So I'm a second year PhD student in a modern language (we are small so I'm not going to say which in order to preserve my anonymity) and finding myself in a bit of an unexpected conundrum.  I'm not sure what steps to take and whether what I'm going through is normal.

Basically, I had a very rough first year of graduate school (relapse of mental health issues exacerbated by stress) and it took me a while to figure out why I was unhappy and which reasons were temporary/situational and which were more existential. I'm still trying to figure a lot of that out, but am slowly starting to realize that I may be in the wrong field or program for my research interests.

I came to my language very much from a cultural studies and linguistics standpoint.  Fell in love with the language and culture after a stint as an exchange student, studied it in college and excelled in the coursework.  While I did the literature/culture track of my major in undergrad, I came from a very interdisciplinary department at a SLAC and was sort of used to doing research that pulled not only from literary criticism, but also from history, cultural studies, and anthropology.  Mind you, this was undergrad, so I'm not claiming to have been an expert on any of these, but I would say that having the liberal arts background as well as the lengthy in-country experience when I first learned the language strongly informed my research interests.  I am still primarily interested in literature and certain other media, but I am more interested in how cultures interact with these texts.  My adviser in undergrad pushed me towards modern language programs and at the time I thought that was a great idea, as I had always envisioned myself at a SLAC where I could teach both the language and a range of courses on both literary and cultural topics (this is where my field seems to be headed, at least at smaller schools).

I chose a program that promised they encouraged interdisciplinary study for students who were interested in pursuing that.  They had some very interesting dissertations with methodologies that were close to the ones I'm drawn to.  However, I'm finding that the program is much more focused on straight-up literary criticism than I am used to and that, further, there is a certain amount of resistance from faculty towards any work that strays from the canon of dead white men.  There is also some resistance from some (not all) of the faculty towards applying certain other theoretical frameworks to literature (such as anthropology).  Other faculty have been more welcoming, but I'm finding that resistance is reflected for the most part in our group of graduate students as well.  It makes for a very insular culture that is far more concerned with literature as an aesthetic object than in any particular cultural implications for research on our language.  I'm wondering if I'm in the wrong program or possibly in the wrong field altogether. While I love literature (especially teaching it) i am finding it increasingly hard to picture myself studying literature and only literature for the rest of my life.  I'm starting to realize I may have been better suited to anthropology or cultural history and am finding this very frustrating.

I have no idea where to go from here or even how to express my concerns or who I can talk to about my research path.  Our program has an insane amount of coursework (3.5-4 years depending on individual schedules) and at the end of this year I'll only be halfway through (though assuming I pass exams, will at least have an MA).  I'm also sort of scared to admit to people that I'm not loving literary study as much as I thought...I've been told that many people with less traditional interests are much happier once they enter the last year of coursework and the dissertation writing phase, but given the high stress and toll on my mental health, I'm sort of scared to risk the unknown.

I don't have much undergrad coursework in history or anthropology and worry that if I am in the wrong field I would not be able to get into a program that would give me chances of getting a job at the end.  I'm currently in one of the best programs for job placement in my field and it's hard to justify giving that up.  

So now for my questions:  Is it possible for PhDs in modern languages/literatures departments to graduate and be successful on the job market with less traditional research interests?  How much of a student's success with such projects depends on faculty? How do I promote such projects to faculty that may not be 100% on board with the sorts of research methods that I'm looking into?  I have 2 supportive faculty members who have done this sort of research, but they are both sort of difficult advisors--one is terrible at keeping in touch wtih students and the other is kind of scattered/disengaged.  Is it ever possible for MA students to switch into different fields without having to start over? Are there any suggestions for if/how I should talk to professors and express that I'm having doubts about my place in this field?  

I'm very frustrated because I feel like they somewhat misrepresented the program to me and the other students don't seem to be encountering the same problems that I'm having because their interests fall more under the umbrella of traditional literary studies.  I'm sort of lacking any sort of mentor figure at the moment who I can talk to about doubts/concerns or really about my path in general.  We don't pick official advisors until the end of our third year when we start putting together our dissertation committee and the professor who has been working as the graduate student advisor since I've come is definitely one of the department's traditionalists and had a very strange knee jerk reaction when I tried to explain something from my (admittedly more liberal) minor field of study.  Just sort of stuck and not sure if there is a place for me in my field :(",10,2016-11-08 09:12:53,AskAcademia
4zdv8g,propheticdreams,t2_10buf1,Looking to study rural flight/Incentivizing Back-to-the-land movements,"A quick bit of background. Undergrad I was double majoring in Anthro and Film, transferred schools, through misleading information my anthro program at the new school accepted my previous anthro credits only as hours toward graduation, not as Anthro courses. It was a bit of a mess, I ended up only graduating with a film degree and a fair GPA (3.8), nothing special.

3 years after graduating I've still been trying to find a niche to return to academia and after much discourse I believe I've found a topic I'm passionate enough about. But I have a few considerations and questions that I hope someone could help with. 

Topic: I want to study movement from rural areas and farming communities toward urban population centers. Furthermore I want to study ways to combat this through small farm development incentives. I grew up in Southern WV and have seen communities shrink from 100,000 to just over 20,000. I want to study this from a number of angles, economic impact, mental/physical health, mega-population logistics.

Considerations:

1.) Education - My undergrad performance could've been better. I did what so many do and decided I was smarter (haha) than my undergrad programs and took my learning into my own hands. I've done very little volunteer work. I've worked in the film industry post-graduation so industry experience won't really fly when applying. I want to go into a top tier program but I know realistically I will probably have to go into a lesser one for a Masters and leverage my way into a top tier program from that for a PhD (or whatever I end up pursuing)

2.) Goals: Yeah I know academic positions are hard (nearly impossible) to come by, I'm aware, but I would still love to throw my name into the cap upon graduation. Would love to teach and stay in academia for life. So I want to set a plan-of-action that doesn't eliminate that potential. But I also want to study in a way that sets me up for policy work. Applied research and potential to work in environments that could affect my topic.

Questions: 

1.) Does anybody know of, or can at least help guide me in the direction of, any programs (in the U.S. preferably) that deal directly with the topic in question.

2.) Should I focus on humanities programs. I'm so comfortable with Anthropology and anthros tenants of research that I'm inclined to look at programs in that realm but I know the value of a humanities degree in the US is dwindling.

Thanks for any help, and know that I am aware that I need to research more before making these decisions. I know it seems like my heads not straightened out, that because its not. That's what I'm currently doing, trying to create a plan of action that sets me up to get the most out of my education in the most realistic way possible.

Feel free to let me know anything, books to read, programs to research, academic advisors to email, volunteer opportunities to consider. I have nothing but the utmost appreciation for any help. 

Sorry for the long post! Thanks in advance.

537pq1,academicfailurethrow,t2_11h0i0,Missed a 20-min meeting w/ thesis advisor. What can I expect?,"**tl;dr: big baby can't handle two weeks of sleep deprivation, misses meeting with advisor, has another nervous breakdown, advisor was nice about it over email but I still feel like scum and don't know how I can dare to face her next week**


-


I'm an undergraduate junior at a mid-sized, elite U.S. university. Ever since the semester started (i.e. for the past two weeks), I've been running on five to six hours of sleep each night while taking 15 credit hours, reading for class, working as a research assistant, studying for the GRE (I'm applying to top PhD programs in a social science discipline), doing fieldwork for my senior honors thesis a year in advance, going to office hours, writing fellowship applications, getting ahead on readings, generally trying to be the best student in my major courses, etc. My aunt, who lives in a very distant and poor country, died during childbirth last month, adding to my stress. Yesterday, I made a huge mistake.


On Thursday night around 10:30 pm, my thesis advisor and I decided to meet for about 20 minutes before a class on Friday afternoon. Usually, I put every appointment in my Google Calendar, but out of sleep deprivation, I totally forgot. I know this is not an excuse for my behavior. On Friday morning, I studied for the GRE, worked and had lunch with the prof for whom I work, went to another prof's office hours, and then sat in a daze before class when I should have been meeting with my thesis advisor. 


After class, I was walking to the pharmacy when I got an email from my advisor. She wrote that she was expecting to see me but I wasn't outside of her office, but we can reschedule for next week. I started panicking and hurriedly wrote an email on my phone saying that I've been very sick for the past couple of weeks and bit off more than I could chew, completely forgetting about the meeting, I promise I won't do it again and that I'll schedule meetings on days when I have less going on and could we please reschedule for next week. Then I hid behind a wall so none of my classmates would see me, cried and had a panic attack for about 1.5 hours, and seriously considered committing suicide. (I should note here that I have suffered from anxiety since I was 12 and attempted suicide twice in middle and high school. My uni only lets students use its counseling services for a year, I've already been booted, and I don't have the time or money to see an off-campus provider.)


My advisor responded within half an hour telling me not to feel bad, and that she knew there must have been a good reason why I was missing – she knew I would never miss a meeting unless something seriously bad happened. She promised to follow up with me to reschedule for next week.


I'm not here to find a way to weasel my way out of this. I wasted her time, I blew it, I take full responsibility for my actions, and I'll accept any consequences without question. She may have been kind in her email, but that doesn't mean she won't chew me out in person. I don't expect her to continue being my advisor, and I expect my reputation at this uni to be irreparably ruined. I may have to withdraw from school and leave academia altogether because the shame is too much to bear. I don't know how I can show up at her office next week, say sorry again, and ask for forgiveness even though I don't deserve it.


I don't want to tell her about my mental health issues because I know there's no (public) crying in academia and I'm a 20-year-old adult who needs to suck it up like everyone else. It would be disrespectful of me to burden others – especially those ranked significantly above me – with my own problems. A year ago, the professor for whom I work managed to figure out that I'm mentally ill without my explicit disclosure, and I'm ashamed of myself every time I see him, so I don't want anyone else to know. I'm also ashamed of myself for not being able to handle a little sleep deprivation. Last academic year, I never got more than seven hours of sleep a night, hardly ever engaged in ""self-care"" beyond basic life maintenance, and had panic attacks once a month, but I still have a 3.8 cumulative and 4.0 major GPA with one co-authored conference paper and another on the way. I used to be able to bear all of it, and now I'm such a weakling. I'm afraid that I was right all along, that I'm not cut out for academia and my hubris finally caught up with me.",10,2016-09-17 15:41:34,AskAcademia
85vi1i,fumblesmcdrum,,Mental health and professionalism: Should you share your anxiety or depression with your advisor?,"**If you are diagnosed with (or suffering from) anxiety or depression, when (if at all) is it advisable to tell your advisor?**

I had this discussion with a labmate recently and we fell on opposite sides:

*Reasons for speaking up:*  Your advisor is a mentor as well as your boss and part of that training involves learning how best to navigate these responsibilities.  They can't help you if they don't know something is wrong.  Also, if things get to the point where it affects your work, then it's best to let them know the root cause and not have them assume things about your work ethic etc.

*Reasons to be quiet:* As a graduate student, it's your job to do the work assigned to you.  There is nothing your advisor can do from the point of view of your own mental illness, so it feels a bit like an excuse, and potentially unprofessional to discuss it.  Regardless of your condition, the same amount of work has to be done.  Your advisor is not there to hold your hand and help you through your problems.  If you are struggling with anxiety or depression, it's important to seek treatment, but do that in your own time and do not let it affect your work.

It's interesting to note that our particular approach to this topic seems map back to our advisor's (perceived) disposition, and our relationship with them.  i.e. one is seen as more gruff, another more supportive.  

I've seen mental health pop up on here frequently, but not quite in this frame.  I'd love to hear what people say.",10,2018-03-20 19:18:16,AskAcademia

I have been studying for my PhD for 7 months and while I have been really enjoying large parts of the research process,I'm finding that my research is exacerbating some pre-existing mental health conditions. The research that I'm doing is, in my opinion, pretty important. It's working with people whose voices are often ignored, silenced or dismissed within academic, political and public debates and who have become increasingly targeted by new sets of legislation here in the UK. My participants so far have been wonderful, and I would consider some of them even to be friends of mine. However, recently, the government has ramped up their attacks and has now passed some legislation that essentially will seriously uproot the lives of the people I'm working with. 

I find myself continuously feeling down when I think about it. I feel like the research I'm doing is pointless, like it's come too late and that it's not going to make a difference anyway now. I feel awful for the people I'm working with, who I have grown close to. I have an overwhelming sense of futility when I think about it, and while I don't feel my work necessarily lacks value, I do feel like I can no longer change anything as a result. I wanted to try and do something good with my work, which is now much harder for me to achieve. 

At the same time, I have the privilege to be able to step back and move away from the whole thing, which is not something the people I'm working with have. And that makes me feel even worse, like I shouldn't be complaining. At the end of the day, I can continue to live my life happily and comfortably; my identity and my livelihood will emerge intact regardless of what happens, and I should be feeling thankful for that, not depressed. 

I feel the work I'm doing is something that needs to be done, and I am lucky enough to be in a position to do it. But I don't know how to reconcile these thoughts. My supervisor is incredibly supportive, and I am seeking help from my university's counselling team. However, I was wondering if anyone else had any advice, experiences or support with similar situations that they would like to share. ",9,2017-05-01 15:49:47,AskAcademia

Last year I left the job for grad school - a 1+3 Masters+PhD programme. I've only just finished the Masters bit and about to enter the PhD part with a new supervisor I actively requested to transfer to.

**My feelings:** I'm not really interested in continuing the PhD programme. This is not a case of a mid-programme slump or anything that can possibly be worked out by a conversation with my supervisor. I'm only at the beginning and I already see that the kind of output that's expected out of people in academia is not for me, impacts my mental health negatively, and most importantly, I don't see myself having a passion for it. I'm interested in the subject matter and applications of the tech I'd be working with but don't see myself investigating the deep theoretical aspects of it.

**The dilemma:** I'm not sure if the intent to apply to jobs outside the course and subsequently leaving it is something I should communicate to my supervisor. On one hand doing so creates an awkward situation where they'd be aware of my lack of long-term plan to stick with the programme so they might as well stop wanting to work with me now. On the other hand, should I get a job, it's also awkward to drop an *""I'm leaving. BYE""* bombshell out of nowhere without letting giving your advisor a chance to, well, advise.

Alright, so,

I'm currently a first-year undergraduate student in the math and physical sciences stream of my university (first-years do not yet have formal programs, but are instead in one of several streams of study, they apply to programs at the end of their first-year). 

My university experience has been a trying one thus far. I was admitted with a nice scholarship upon application and was supposed to have been a third-year student by now, but due to mental and physical health issues, I ended up taking an incomplete courseload my first official year, then having to take a leave of absence the second, and only now am I back, and still a first year. 

I'm now properly registered with the accessibility services at my school, and at their advice and that of academic advisors, am starting with a partial courseload to try to learn how to be a functioning student and individual (living on my own for the first time). And, really, until yesterday evening, I was doing pretty okay. My mental health is very much Not Good, and I'm waiting on specialists and doing things in the meantime to try to sort things out, but things are difficult. I have a lot of difficulty with executive functioning skills. Despite this, I am doing exceptionally well in my language course, and was doing well in my math course. Keyword being was. 

The math course that I'm in is the one designated for students who have an interest in math, but aren't certain they wish to pursue it, or are in the physical or computer sciences, or who may not have the necessary prerequisite knowledge/maturity to take the higher-level math course. Our first term test was yesterday, and it covered introductory logic, notation, quantifiers, formal limits, continuity, epsilon-delta proofs, and things of that sort. I did really well on the assignments prior to this test. They were a little challenging, but given time and the ability to ask questions, I performed very very well and thought I understood the material reasonably well. I've been going to office hours, speaking with my professor after lectures, and double-checking that my proofs are well-written and that my approaches are correct. My relationship with math has been difficult in the past, mostly because of the disappointing math curriculum and teaching standard where I live; students are taught to memorize and never question why or how things work and that led me to a lot of frustration. Despite never doing poorly in my math classes, I feel like my foundational math is not as solid as it could be, that I never really did as well as I could, and that maybe I still have some unresolved emotional issues there. But, for the first time, as I began this course and saw how capable and enthusiastic my instructors are, as I started to find the content interesting and even enjoyable (epsilon delta proofs are like satisfying little puzzle mini-games!) and doing well I began to think that maybe, just maybe, I could be good at this. Maybe I could be a math student. Maybe.

But then the term test came yesterday, and wow. I don't even know what to say. I did all the practice problems, reviewed all the videos, did the tutorials, clarified my questions, and thought things would hopefully be fine. All the signs suggested things would be fine. Then I started the test, and it may as well have been written in Inuktitut. I could hardly make sense of anything. I couldn't remember how to prove statements, how to reason through rough work. Determining limits of compositions from a graph?? How does that work? I honestly cannot tell you whether I failed that test or by some miracle pulled and 80 or something, and I don't know when we'll have our marks back. I don't even want to look at it when we do get it back. I feel physically ill about my performance on this test. 

I have to be honest and say that I'm not used to doing poorly, or to have any significant struggle understanding things. Courses like biology and chemistry and everything else have come easily and intuitively and despite having arguably one of the worst periods of my life at the time, I still managed to finish with above 95 in them. But math.... I feel so slow. So stupid. So abysmally stupid. Things don't come as quickly, in fact, they come quite slowly. Too slowly.  I did really well on the problem sets but now I'm just wondering if I faked my way into that, because apparently I don't understand that much at all, if that test was anything to go by. Maybe I'm incapable of doing things on my own.  I don't even know if it will be possible for me to finish with above a 90 in this course now (which, while I recognize that grades are not necessarily the most important qualifier or anything, I would like to pursue some form of graduate schooling so a decent academic record is preferable).

Just last week my professor was telling me they'd be happy to speak to me more about pursuing math, and now, I don't think I can even look them in the eye. I must seem so stupid. It's worth questioning whether I even belong in this course. I know that they say math is a discipline where hard work surpasses talent, but even then, I think natural aptitude is important to some degree, and I'm starting to question whether I actually have any. How can I even ask them for help when just last week I was dumb enough to admit I was just slightly considering math?

I'm tired of running away from my failures throughout the past couple of years though, so I really want the chance to repair this. If only out of stubbornness, I want the opportunity to conquer this material and understand it, to devour it until it becomes like breathing and maybe give math the chance I never truly gave it before. The chance I didn't give myself before. I intend to speak to my professor on Monday and ask for help or guidance, but I don't know how to go about doing so. What do I tell them? How much do I tell them? I feel like whatever potential I had when I was younger shriveled up and died the day my mental health decided it was time to mutate. I'm already a disappointment and I don't know whether to be honest about my past here. No one knows except the relevant counselors and advisors here and it's kind of isolating, but probably for the best? I really wanted to develop a good relationship with this professor, maybe impress them on some minute level, to not just be some random student sitting in the lecture hall. But really I'm scared that they'll think I'm actually, certifiably stupid. I'm still nervous to ask them questions when there is something I don't quite fully grasp, to answer their questions and be wrong. I thought about speaking to one of the other course professors instead, who I'm less nervous around (might be better so that I can actually ask questions??) but this is the one for my lecture section, and they're a very impressive individual and I want to learn everything I can from them. I just don't want to be stupid or a disappointment or annoyance.

So yeah. 

I might like math, I might not, I might not be adept at it, but I want the chance to be. Given my previous decent performance and likely disastrous test, how do I approach my professor who I'm kind of intimidated by? Just going up to them and being like ""Hi that test was a dumpster fire please take me under your wing and teach me everything you know"" is probably a bit much to dump on someone I've known for less than two months when I don't even know whether I should be studying math.

I'm really sorry this is so long, but I think I'm having a moderately-sized crisis so. 

Um, any suggestions?",8,2019-10-19 16:28:42,AskAcademia

Its in a new country from both my home and my PhD.  So you would think I've done this ""moving countries"" thing before, I should be a pro at it.  But last time was a major disaster mental health wise.  And I can't help but think its going to be the same now.

ayzhla,StunningAcadia,t2_3dflhguy,Should I talk to my professor before I drop the class?,"I hope this is the right place to ask this, if not, sorry in advance.

I've missed a lot of one of my classes this semester and I got a message from the prof today titled ""Attendance"" that I'm currently too anxious to read. I'm not trying to excuse it, but I've been struggling with a really intense wave of depression I haven't been able to shake for the last two years and it's just been getting worse and worse, leading to this mess I've gotten myself into.

It's not that I've just been letting this spiral out of control with no treatment, either. I've been on three or four different anti-depressants, all of which gave me really bad side effects I couldn't handle. I'm seeing a psychologist regularly, but she isn't really much help because nothing prescribed is really working and the latest thing she prescribed isn't covered by my insurance and I can't get ahold of her or get her to call me back about sending out a prescription for something that is. I was also seeing a therapist regularly, which was very helpful but she moved a while back and I haven't been able to find someone new I click with yet. My regular GP is on maternity leave right now as well, so I can't just go to her to talk to her about getting something else prescribed or try something else therapy wise when the things my psychiatrist are giving me are making me sick/apathetic.

On top of all of that, I moved out of my parent's house a while back to try and make my life easier (much shorter commute to school and work) and it's been a bit of a nightmare ever since. Heat issues in my building started in october and were finally fixed a week ago (it's gotten down to -40 degrees celcius where i live and I don't have a car), and three weeks ago my building had a bed bug outbreak that's made sleeping at night almost impossible, not that it was very good to begin with, and shot my anxiety through the roof. I don't really have any friends at school anymore and I live alone, so I don't have anyone to be accountable to in terms of getting up and being a productive/responsible, so a lot of mornings my alarm goes off and I just can't get up and instead spend most of the day in bed crying and hating my life and myself. 

I'd originally taken a semester off to get this treatment plan going when my mental health issues started to get really bad, but it just seems to have gone to complete shit over the last year and moving was probably a terrible mistake. I know none of this excuses me missing class and I shouldn't use mental illness as a crutch, but I don't really know what to do to get back on track at this point.  One bad decision has just spiraled into many more. 

To be clear, I'm not behind in any of my classes, I have all my worked turned in, and my grades have all been fine. This one grade's on class participation though, so I'm probably a bit screwed on that front. I'm going to work on figuring out what my next steps should be to get my life back together over the weekend, and I think dropping this class is going to be the first step in all of that. 

I know this professor pretty well, I've taken 4 other classes with her, but she intimidates the hell out of me and is really hard to read. I can't tell if she likes me or hates me. Should I talk to her, and what exactly should I say to her? She already kind of know about my mental health issues, as I've brought them up in a class discussion before and I have disability accommodations(for another condition), but I just really have no idea what to say.

tl;dr
I'm a giant mess and missed way too much class already this semester, but have kept up on the work in class and have gotten good grades on what I've submitted. Today I got an email titled ""attendance"" I'm too scared to read and now considering dropping the class, and might just have to because of how much I've missed. Should I talk to my professor about it before hand, and if so, what should I tell them?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated ",7,2019-03-09 04:11:55,AskAcademia
ckzlbv,Dylanb993,t2_12j1ba3x,Scared to accept Teaching Fellowship in first year of masters.,"I’m starting the first year of my masters program in the Fall, and I’ve been offered a teaching fellowship that basically covers my tuition and a 5k stipend. 

This will be my first time moving out of my parents’ place and living on my own. Also moving to the opposite side of the country where I know no one and won’t have any friends or family nearby. 

My biggest concern is the time commitment and workload of the fellowship. It’s teaching 4, 2 hour labs a week. I’ve been told that it will take atleast double that in prep time to learn the material and get ready to present it. 

I’d really rather not subject myself to too much stress especially since it’s my first semester and I’ll have a full course load, and be going through some MASSIVE life changes while adjusting. 

Also, I’m going into industry and definitely do not want to be a professor/teacher, so the teaching experience in a classroom isn’t something I need, want, or would enjoy. 

Any advice and/or recommendations?

My mental health and enjoyment of this program are my priorities and I just want to make sure I stay happy and sane. 

Please let me know if I’m worrying too much or if I’m being reasonable. Is the financial help worth it in your opinion?

32ljik,baloney24,t2_iqhhh,Should I stay in PhD program?? 2nd yr student with ADHD,"I am currently in 2nd year of a top Management PhD program. I am seriously lagging behind on research requirements with barely anything to show. On top of that I have my 1st year summer paper still pending. 

I have always had difficulty getting anything done. Be it routine jobs or research focussed jobs. I start with steaming interest in one and commit myself, only to lose interest completely very soon. Something similar happened in my phd program. In the 1st year I just kept questioning what I was doing, how pointless our field is, and how we keep publishing papers just for the sake of it. Now and then, I had moments of heightened interest which would quickly fade away. By the time I started my 2nd year, the weight of pending work got to me and I finally sought help from the mental health clinic at our university. I was later diagnosed with ADHD and depression, and have been on Adderall since January. Things have improved remarkably since then. I find my field more interesting, it is easier to read through papers, make sense of things, and even make sense of my own research (to come extent). It is still difficult to get things done on time though. However, since I am lagging behind so much in the program, the faculty does not feel good about my candidature. The PhD program chair has asked me to seriously consider if I want to do something else, and they will offer a terminal masters that can help me find jobs. I, however, am not sure about leaving academia. I feel that I have just found medical help, just figured out what my problem was, and given time will catch up with other students. I am not sure what to do. I am very fickle minded and always want to do hundred different things. So, I am not sure even if I go into something else it will be easier. I feel like I will always want to do too many things, will always question my career choice no matter what I do. With a MS in management, I can at best get a consulting job, which I think will be intellectually boring.

5ndlwe,jDawgLite,t2_inxc6,Where do you believe we should draw the line with academic freedom?,"Hello Reddit. My university recently started an anti-psychiatry scholarship, and I'm absolutely outraged. I can't understand how this can happen.

Anyway, my question is - where do we draw the line with academic freedom? The university's rationale for allowing the scholarship is that all research should be allowed to be conducted, even if it's in line with unpopular opinions, provided the researchers are trying to positively contribute to society and their research has some foundation (I don't believe anti-psychiatry has any foundation, but that's not my point here so I'll leave it at that).",7,2017-01-11 17:50:10,AskAcademia

w3qr7,Posthuman089,,Would I be Able to Get Accepted to Graduate School Given My Current Situation?,"Greetings, I was directed to this subreddit via nice fellow redditor and I have a coupled of questions concerning graduate school, a second BS degree or prospects for a career.

Let me begin with a bit of my personal background. In high school I excelled at math of all kinds getting top ranking scores on all the AP tests I took, going into college with what little guidance I had it was decided that I would major in math. After a while of taking college calculus, the snootiness and downright hurtful things engineering students would say to me deterred me from math/engineering degree path - at the time it felt like I didn't want to be associated with these kinds of folk(nothing personal, a bad experience on my part). I swapped majors 4 times and by the end of college I graduated with a BS in biochemistry(would have preferred chemistry but I just wanted out for several reasons). College was a challenging time for me, not because of financial issues but my mental health was deteriorating after a break up with my girlfriend, soon to be wife of 5 years. I learned that I had autism, bipolar, agoraphobia, social anxiety, substance abuse problems and stress related psychotic episodes. I never made a single friend at school despite trying to engage people, but I failed over and over. I was afraid to talk to my professors, the first time I went to my organic chemistry professor to discuss an exam he was literally screaming at some poor girl and I was mortified. I couldn't talk to anyone, I went into isolation, I had a mental breakdown, every time I went outside I had a panic attack. I managed to pull out of school with a 3.4 GPA but no references. I tried to get into research groups but I was denied on account of my junior status and funding issues. That is basically my back story leading up to a few questions.

Firstly, is it possible to get into grad school with such few references? Would a teacher whose class I did really well in vouch for me if I went back and told them this story or am I SOL? I would like to learn more about the biomarkers for mental illness and how receptors play a role in the development of the aforementioned if admitted to graduate school. Secondly, math and chemistry have always been my main interests, i'm thinking of pursuing a second BS in chemical engineering. I have applied to many jobs(100+) with only a few bites that told me I did not have the research experience/qualifications. I want a stable career and I want to do something I am passionate about, so I am thinking about this second BS. Are there Co-op programs for people in my situation who want to earn a degree yet still work? Are these available through school? Lastly, should I try to get a lab tech job right now to fill time and gain some experience? the only 2 jobs i've ever had were an arcade manager and a waiter. People treated me very cruelly and it is hard to get back into public without being terrified of being attacked/hurt emotionally. I'm just really lost right now, I know i'm in a very good situation in such a down economy, i'm just confused as to what the right move would be and if the move is even possible at this point in time.

6u7owt,phdthrowaway9999,,"Yet another ""should I leave my PhD"" post","Hi all, using a thowaway because some of my colleagues know my regular username. I'm going to try to lay everything on the table, and would love to hear form anyone whose got insight or advise, but I'd especially love to hear from those of you who maybe took time off during your phd or those of you who left your phd and found fulfilling employment elsewhere. Apologies for any typos, errors, or generally scattered thoughts, this has been weighing on me for months and is now coming up as word vomit.

I finished my MA in 2014 (social sciences), and was accepted to a pretty highly ranked PhD program. Upon arriving, I was assigned a first year advisor, who I thought I'd enjoy working with, but our relationship turned toxic pretty quickly. I completed my first year with only a few hiccups, but mostly in good shape. Over the summer I sought a new advisor who I think better aligned with my work style and research interests. She's an absolute heavyweight in the field, awards named after her and such, so it's sometimes very intimidating to talk to her, but she's immensely supportive and I value the relationship I've built with her. I began my second year with a fresh, optimistic outlook, but by the end of the fall semester, I was deeply depressed. I've struggled with depression and anxiety for much of my adult life, but I was to a point where I was barely functional. I sought treatment and barely finished the semester by the skin of my teeth, but mentally/emotionally things weren't looking good. I continued therapy/medication, but with little success. Spring semester (we're now in '16) was ROUGH. SO rough, that I was unable to finish. I felt I wasn't smart or disciplined enough to be there. I had some hardcore imposter syndrome. I couldn't get out of bed, I didn't care about any of my work, and I was skipping classes left and right. I approached my advisor and she suggested I take a medical leave of absence, and asking for incompletes in my courses (my advisor settled on giving me a B+ in her class because ""I know you learned something"" and I had completed nearly all of the work). So, I took a leave of absence with two incompletes. This past academic year, I adjuncted at the community college back home. While I've made some progress with my mental health, the above concerns are still a daily struggle for me (and I've accepted this is likely to be a struggle I'll experience the rest of my life). When I first began my leave of absence, I thought for sure I didn't ever want to go back. But I have a constant nagging that I'll regret that decision for the rest of my life. I had to deactivate my Facebook because every time a colleague posted about a publication, a good class, or a research milestone, I spiraled into deep self-loathing and jealousy. At the same time, I catch myself applying theories I've learned to everyday situations, and getting excited to explain something that's relevant to my studies to my friends and family.  It's now time to make a decision on returning to the program or not, and I'm utterly paralyzed.  That's sort of the basic structure of what's going on, but there's a little more at play here. 

I should mention that research isn't my all-consuming passion. I LOVE teaching, and parts of research really thrill me, but I'd definitely say I'm in this to teach moreso than to research. I'd love a job at a small liberal arts college, but that's a little far down the road for this discussion. During my two years in the program, I worked on several projects (though, not as many as I'd like, nor as many as my peers), and with my leave of absence, many of these have stalled or completely fallen apart. I don't yet have any first author publications, though I do have several conference presentations and an invited encyclopedia pub under my belt. 

I should also mention that I didn't build much of a support network while I was in the program. While I had several friendly acquaintances in my program, I failed to make any actual friends. I was incredibly lonely. 

Finances are also a concern. My GA stipend was fairly low, and I have no help from family, so I was taking out large sums of loans to be able to pay rent and live reasonably comfortably. This financial situation would have to continue, and I'll likely have well over $100k in loans if I finish the degree. 

I'm worried that the only reasons I want to finish are rooted in social comparisons and some (false) need to have a prestigious career. I'm worried that I've taken too much time off, that I didn't accomplish enough during my first two years, and that (with the current academic job market) I'll have an expensive degree and no job to pay for it. I'm worried that if the PhD program was a struggle, I'll never make it in as a professor. 

I'm also worried I'll regret quitting for the rest of the life.  I'm completely embarrassed anytime anyone asks what I'm doing right now. I've avoided interacting with close friends from my MA program, because I feel like I no longer belong. 

I'm happy to clarify or answer any questions, and I'm open to any advice, hard truths or encouragement. Thanks for reading and sorry for the wall of text!",7,2017-08-17 04:38:31,AskAcademia
1p15yt,[deleted],,How to deal with bullying by the advisor?,"I'm a third year Ph.D. student looking for concrete advice on dealing with this situation:

My advisor is a known researcher in my STEM field and has collaborations across the globe. He travels a **lot** (he spends somewhere around jet-lagged days every month at the home institute). Because of his many administrative roles and large group, all of his students get very little time to interact with him. In that limited interaction time, he is not receptive and is extremely critical of the students.

A major chunk of my meeting time with him is spent in him criticizing my presentation (grammar, diction, volume, sentence structure) rather than the ideas themselves. Since he works on many problems at once, across the various collaborations he has, he does not understand the details and is not receptive to any corrections to his misunderstanding. Hence, it takes a lot of time, effort and patience to communicate the idea and obtain useful feedback and direction.

One of my colleagues, a grad student with the same advisor, attempted suicide last month and has been undergoing therapy since then. Another student committed suicide around six years ago. I understand that mental health issues are prevalent in grad school but think that the stress of having an antagonizing advisor might have contributed to these unfortunate events.

I stay reasonably strong in the face of this stress, but would like to figure out how to deal with such an advisor and get maximum work output from my interaction with him.

I just finished my MA studies and I'll start my PhD in September (full time, Social Sciences, EU). So I'm basically free for a month.

But how to go about starting a doctorate? Should I prepare by doing some reading? In your experience, are there any must-have gadgets that will facilitate my daily PhD life (productivity / organization apps, equipment for my office setup, etc.)?

One thing I've learnt in my BA and MA studies is not to compare myself to others as far as time management, productivity, and learning strategies are concerned, I'm still curious though: how long do you usually work? Typical 9-5? Work on weekends? And how do you take care of your mental health (does it really take that big of a toll on PhD students?)?

Since I'll have the time, I was thinking about cleaning up some things in my MA dissertation in hopes of being able to publish a chapter. Publications really seem to be the currency of academia and I don't know if I'll ever be able to get back to that once my PhD starts, so might be a good time to try now.

4mg0g7,microbeeologist,t2_q5egs,Is this a normal research lab environment?,"The past 2 years I have worked within my research lab as a research assistant. Also since then, I have been the sole care taker of a family member, and also worked part time and on the weekends. When I was first starting out, I asked a lot of questions, but then missed 2 weeks of presently being at the lab, and I feel like I missed out on the initial bonding with my labmates. We are all in the same undergrad year, and we have taken a lot of classes together.

I have always worked hard, and produced results. It's to the point where I have presented posters at over 5 local conferences, and given 2 oral presentations about my project. The first project I worked on is currently a paper in review for publication in a peer reviewed journal. However, I have always felt a little behind when compared to my labmates. They don't have as many personal responsibilities as I do, and they do great work. So when I have doubts, I go to them to ask questions, but they just shrug me off. They tell me they don't know the answers, but when another person asks the same question, they suddenly have an answer(this happened once, 5 min after I asked the same exact question..). When doing bench work, I always offer help, but no one asks me to help out. The next day my PI texts me asking me to offer to help with bench work. 

Since our PI is usually out of the lab writing and applying to grants, I just dedicated time to looking online/read papers for answers. This in turn, takes time off my hands to actually dedicate to quickly produced results. I get scolded, I get told my results are ""too raw"", but I feel like maybe I haven't been explained properly what needs to be done. When I ask for clarification, I get cryptic responses. (""You need to think more"";""Try to digest the results"";""Figure x doesn't make any sense."")


I have actively tried reaching out to each labmate individually to offer help/ask questions/just say hi, nothing changes. Last year I worked at the biology department, and my co-workers told me it wasn't me, it's that the environment in that lab was toxic(they all know my labmates and my PI). My past boss was concerned that this was affecting my mental health, especially with all the responsibilities I juggle while doing research 15+ hours a week. 


I graduate from my undergrad soon, but I just want to quit and leave the lab. I don't feel appreciated, nor like I contribute to anything. Is this the kind of environment that is normal for research labs? Any insight would be great.

ax9alh,kgesses,t2_2a3egpq4,Tips on Writing my first Grant Proposal,"Hi everyone! 

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this so if anyone has any better suggestions please let me know! :) 

I need to write a grant proposal for one of my high school classes. The assignment is extra-credit but I want to use it as practice for when I'll need them later. Ideally, my plan is to open an organization that provides mental health services and mentoring (essentially as an after school program) to kids, teen, and young adults in the Atlanta, Georgia area that wouldn't otherwise have access. 

Specifically, though, my question is where do I start? I could really use any type of advice on formatting, anything that needs to be in it in particular, or even just good resources on where to find help for it. As a home school senior I don't exactly have any experience but I want to start practicing and make it as good as I can as I will likely be writing these for years to come. 

Thank you so much for any help you can offer! ",6,2019-03-04 16:53:12,AskAcademia
gl67hu,epsilonD3LT4,t2_60qcxil8,Very highly regarded (but also very abrasive) secondary PhD supervisor - how much should I involve him in my project?,"I'm  doing a PhD and I have two people listed down as my supervisors  for  the project, who I will call supervisors A and B. I get on really  well  with supervisor A, he makes constructive suggestions in a  constructive  way, and I always come out of meetings with him feeling  better about my  work. In many respects, I couldn't have asked for a  better supervisor  than A, and I feel I can be quite transparent about  how my work is  going with him (including discussing soft skills like  working  effectively from home during the lockdown, managing time and so  forth).  Supervisor B is several decades older, extremely well-regarded  in the  department, had numerous awards named after him and has made   significant contributions to his area from what I gather. Things have   panned out so far in such a way that I've seldom needed to meet   supervisor B in order to make progress with my work - technically he is   listed as a supervisor for my research project but it's more of a ""he   pops in when he's interested""-type arrangement.

However,  the main reason I prefer to stick with meeting supervisor A  is that I  often encounter supervisor B around in our department and he  has a way  with people which comes across as incredibly abrasive and  overly  critical, often casually undermining people in conversation,  asking  questions to people in a condescending way or even just making   unnecessary verbal ""snipes"" at people. He is infamous in the department   for this, and has supervised many of the academics when they were PhD   students, but it seems that nobody has pulled him up on his rudeness   because of his authority (when it comes to him supervising students) and   his academic reputation. Many anecdotes about him from his former   students have originated, for example, in reacting badly and   inappropriately to former students of his having children, going on   holiday or taking part in extracurricular activities during their   doctorates with him. These are normal things that people can expect to   do without being penalised by most (sane) supervisors. Supervisor B is   incredibly knowledgeable, and has some interesting stories to tell, but   is not an enjoyable person to be around and I try to avoid meeting him   unless I absolutely have to (once every couple of months versus once a   week with supervisor A).

However,  because of his reputation, people have alluded that a  reference letter  from supervisor B would be a golden ticket to get a  postdoc/industrial  position wherever I wanted, as he is an incredibly  well-established  name in his field. This leaves me torn as to whether I  want to involve  him much or not in the project. As far as I am aware,  not including him  in meetings regularly does not seem to be posing  supervisor B (or A)  any major issues, apart from a whinge on supervisor  B's part once or  twice which ended without any repercussions. If I did  involve him  regularly it would certainly benefit my career in getting  publications  with him and a recommendation letter from him in the end,  but being  supervised by him regularly would have a negative impact on my   confidence and mental health. I'm a mature student in my area (so I'm   rusty with some things), so I already lack confidence in my abilities   and could do without someone potentially making me feel worse.

Some  may diagree, but I feel that it is vital that a PhD supervisor  is  someone who you can establish a positive and professional working   rapport with. I think it's often an aspect of doing/choosing PhDs which   is often not talked about, despite PhD students effectively needing to   work with the same person for 3-4 years and there being many ""horror""   stories of students who have quit or failed as a result of clashes with   their supervisors. One of my former professors from during my undergrad   also told me that the rapport/personality of a supervisor is just as   important as the research area, if not more (although obviously there's   no use having a supervisor you get on really well with but whose   research area/interests don't line up with yours).

I'd  be interested to hear about any input on this - am I dodging a  bullet  here or simply shooting myself in the foot career-wise?

TL;DR:  I have two PhD supervisors, one of whom is brilliant and I see very  regularly, and my secondary supervisor (who I don't see very often) is  highly regarded in his field but also very abrasive and upleasant with  people including students he's formerly supervised. Not sure about whether to include the second one more often for potential career benefits.",6,2020-05-17 01:01:13,AskAcademia
854v13,HumanDrinkingTea,,When did you decide you wanted to get a PhD and how did you prepare? Need some help with my path.,"I'm a non-traditional student (career changer) with a bachelors degree that's pretty much unrelated to anything I'm all that interested in studying. I've not been out of school too long (I'm 27), but I'm still old enough that I feel behind. 

Anyway, I'm taking a dive into getting a second bachelors degree. I came into it largely because I wanted to increase my career prospects (major in CS), but I find that I'm more drawn to the theoretical aspects of the subject and less drawn to the industry. I'm thinking of switching my major to computational mathematics and aiming to pursue a higher degree such as a PhD.

My problem is that I have a few concerns about this route. First is financial-- with a BS in CS, I can graduate and jump into the workforce right away. It's a ""safe"" choice. However, with my specific areas of interest, a higher level degree may be required before I can gain any useful employment. I am unsure how many years I can support myself in my academic endeavors.

This brings me to my next concern-- many people have suggested to me that perhaps I should pursue a purely academic career. I've been told that it is a good fit for my personality and that I have the aptitude/work ethic for it. However, from my outside perspective, the competition seems quite fierce. Although this route seems appealing to me, it seems to be setting off alarm bells in the ""risk aversion"" part of my brain. 

So you have an idea of how I am as a student: I have a spotty academic background, but a strong reputation among my professors as a good student. In high school and throughout my first degree I had an undiagnosed health issue as well as mental health issues that pulled my GPA down. I graduated with a 3.5 in an easy major, which isn't awful, I know, but I guess it lowered my confidence in myself a good bit. The upside is that in the classes I didn't bail on, I was typically the one of the top students in the class. This is at a medium tier state university, so not super competitive.

Now I'm a part-time student at a CC working on my core STEM courses (Calc, Physics, etc...). So far I have a 4.0 and I'm loving it *and* I've been told from some of the professors in the department that my Calc prof has been going around telling everyone what a great student I am. I'm honored (to say the least) that he'd feel compelled to do that, and I appreciate that other professors (who I haven't taken) seem happy to get to know me, but I worry that this is leading the department to overestimate my potential when it comes to succeeding in academia. They are very encouraging, but I don't buy it when my adviser says I shouldn't have too much of a problem gaining admittance into a PhD program (down the road)-- remember I'm at a CC and early in my (new) career path. It will also take a while because I'm only attending part-time. 

I have some specific interests that I'd like to explore, but my knowledge in those arenas is extremely limited. I have strong interests in machine learning, data science, and computational neuroscience. I am unsure how I would going about exploring these fields further, and I am similarly unsure how I would go about getting involved in the sort of research that would prepare me for an post-grad degree. 

Because this post is getting too long, I'll stop here. I'm hoping you all can help me figure out if a PhD route is a realistic option for me and if you can help me figure out how I'd go about reaching this goal. Of course, as per the title, I also want to know how YOU started on your path to a PhD and what it took to get there. I'm open to advice, stories, or really just anything that will help me feel a little bit less lost and inadequate in my journey.

dapemy,apsconditus_,t2_2kwyt2ac,How do I get the most out of what's left of my undergrad after wasting most of it away?,"I found this subreddit today and I have to say it's fantastic! I've been able to answer a high number of questions about the field by just scrolling around. Today I wanted to get your sense on something that's been eating at my soul little by little: I think I have wasted most of my time as an undergrad.

I started university in the fall of 2014 with the intention of graduating in 2018. Let's just say that that never happened. I had to take time off my sophomore year for mental health problems by dropping to of my four classes. I've been afraid to make the ""reality"" of my problems known to my professors for fear of the stigma. I went on to do the same thing in the fall of 2017. Then, I had a manic episode and had to withdraw from the spring semester of 2018. I proceeded to take the fall of as well. I'm *finally* back in class without major issues THIS fall.

**I essentially dropped one and a half years worth of units.**

Now that time is running out I realize that I've missed out on a lot of opportunities: I never ""networked"" with my professors. The ones I used to be close to either retired or left. One of the went to visit me in the psychiatric hospital when I was manic; I never took a cool internship nor had the desire to; I'm not exceptional or have grades perfect enough to pursue graduate studies (something I really want to do).

Considering I have at the most three semesters to go, what do you recommend that I do to take advantage of the time I have left?",6,2019-09-29 02:25:26,AskAcademia

I have been a public speaker for a few years now. I did a TEDx talk about my own journey and recovery regarding my mental health. Ever since I started getting requests to do more talks. I really enjoy doing it so that's why I keep sharing my story.

At first, I was doing it on a volunteer basis and would never ask for organizations to pay me. My mother and a friend both advised me to start asking to be paid for my work because it is a lot of preparation and it would give ""value"" my work. However, whenever I am asked by organizations how much I want to get paid, I literally do not know what to tell them. I don't know what's the financial worth of my work and what's a reasonable price for it.

8enoz9,bluegrayy,,Is a personal thank you letter from a student to a professor appropriate?,"I’m currently in a professional degree seeking program. This school year I have been dealing with some significant personal and mental health issues which have impacted many parts of my life, including school. I have many times felt that everything I was doing was a waste and I at one point lost purpose in pursuing my degree.

However, there is one class that I’m currently enrolled in which really affected me in a way I didn’t think it would. I never went to my professor’s office hours or really talked to her much, and my attendance in her class suffered a bit. But, the material she gave us, her insight when I was in class, and the open forum she provided in our class (it was a seminar, so we did plenty of talking amongst our classmates), really did something for me mentally and emotionally this past month. Her class essentially helped make me feel like I could have some purpose and be useful with my chosen career path.

I wanted to know whether it was appropriate for me to write her a letter during the summer explaining this and thanking her. I’ve been trying to thank every single person who has reached out to me or helped me, even in some minor way, the past year given everything that has been going on, so I’d like to thank her even though we didn’t really have a relationship minus me being in her class.

9agaj9,throwaway19851992764,,[ADVICE] PhD student with a big problem. Give it to me straight.,"Hi everyone,

Any advice or thoughts you have would be great. No need to sugarcoat. I like this sub a lot and have been lurking for quite awhile now. I apologize in advance for the length of this, I just don't know where else to turn to get objective advice. I can't get a read on if I've smeared my name forever in this program or if I still have a chance to turn things around.

Background: I am going into my 2nd year of my PhD. Classes start Monday. I spent nearly all of my 20s working on getting into a doctorate program (BS, MS, tons of research and practice experience, 5 rounds of GREs, two rounds of applying....etc). I four pointed my master's and worked my ass off and finally I got into a great program. Aaaaaand now I've proceeded to royally fuck up this past year.

I have always absolutely sucked at doing things ahead of time. I'm a procrastinator at heart. I also avoid things that make me anxious (e.g. big assignments) like the plague because they freak me out. I got through my BS and MS without this messing me up very much. I missed a deadline here or there but it was never the norm.  I was diagnosed with ADHD after my bachelor's but never needed/sought any accommodations during my master's. Now in my PhD its become absolutely impossible for me to meet deadlines in my classes and I'm not sure what to do next. Most of the time my GA work hasn't suffered the same (e.g. I've kept up with the deadlines there), but its getting worse.

One class first semester is a good example because it was particularly terrible. I am not exaggerating when I say that I think I turned in almost every single assignment in that class late. I also showed up consistently late to the same class. Sometimes I missed class. It was just an absolute shit show. I met with my professor halfway through the semester and was like ""I am so sorry, I don't know what my problem is but I know it is not OK and I'm trying to work on it"". He told me he didn't care about my tardiness in his class because my work was good and usually only a few hours late, but that it would definitely bite me later in life if I didn't shape up. Obviously he is correct. Every time I missed a deadline I'd swear up and down to myself that I'd never do it again and I'd learned my lesson...yada yada...and then I'd miss another one soon after. I thought maybe my mental health was the problem (I have anxiety and depression in addition to ADHD). I got myself back into counseling and started seeing a psychiatrist again for medication management. My depression is better but my anxiety and attention issues are still problems and at times make quality of life quite difficult. I somehow passed all my classes with A's and B's and swore second semester would be better. ...I'm sure you can guess what happened next.

Long story short - 2nd semester was also a shit-show. I again had major issues with tardiness. Sometimes I made up excuses. Sometimes I didn't. I kept waiting to get called out or get in trouble but no one said anything. I kept going to therapy and taking my medication and promising myself I'd figure it out. My therapist advised me to get accommodations because of my mental health, so I did. I met with the grad director about the accommodations (basically just to tell him I had them) and he was very understanding. He said he had not had any complaints about me or my work from faculty. I kept telling myself every time I missed a deadline that it was the last time. It never was. I lied (claimed technological problems, etc) my way through submitting all my finals late in all my classes at the end of second semester, which I still feel like shit about. Somehow no one called me out and I got A's in every class, which again - I don't understand because I don't understand how I am not being penalized for all this late work.

So onto the current issue...

This summer we had a huge project to complete that you have to pass to continue on to comps. It was basically a thesis and we had 4 months to do it. I've done a thesis. I know how time consuming it is. But I got married this summer (which has been planned for over two years so it's no excuse - I knew when it was happening for a loooong time) and let myself get distracted with wedding planning and moving and other research/work. I put writing the project off until the last minute, knowing full well it was a mistake but lying to myself that I'd have enough time. The deadline came and I had approximately half done. I had no choice but to just once again just turn in what I have and say ""I'm so sorry I know this is unacceptable but here's what I have. I will turn in the finished product ASAP. Totally know it probably won't count but I just want you to see that I'm capable."" Now its more than 24 hours after the deadline and I still have a fuck ton of this project left. I'm an emotional wreck and I'm so ashamed and disappointed in myself and want to just say ""I'll fix it next time"". But frankly, I don't know if I will. And who knows if I will even have the chance - there is a chance I could get kicked out over this. Or have to repeat my entire first year. The project committee is meeting to figure out what to do with me.

I'm fed up and exhausted and so is my husband (who has been riding this emotional roller coaster with me). As much as I love my program I just don't know if I should continue. If I am going to continue to mess up, I feel like leaving now is a better idea. I am currently ruining a good reputation I worked YEARS to build and replacing it with a shitty one that I don't want. Which is more irrational - to keep saying I'm going to magically break this pattern or cling to the possibility I could figure it out? What if this is just a sign that I don't want this PhD enough or care enough about my work?

I keep seeing job announcements that sound cool through our school that only call for a BS or MS and thinking ""If I could be happy with that, what the hell am I doing a PhD for?"" I'm second guessing all my original reasons for coming here in the first place. I'm about to turn 30 and haven't started a family yet. Maybe I should just throw in the towel and focus on the other things in life that could make me happy besides my career. I don't really care about publishing - I'm in this PhD for the research training and the applied work it will open doors to in my field. Maybe that is also a sign I should leave though? But if I do leave I know it will feel like I've wasted a ton of the last 10 years of my life - which were all focused on getting into grad school. 

Do I leave? Do I stick it out? I don't know what to do. Even if I do stick it out and manage to get my shit together - how much damage have I done already? Is it fixable? I feel like as a professor I would just be totally fed up with me by now.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr - 2nd year PhD student, huge issue with tardiness to class and late assignments all first year. Apparently my quality of work is fine because I somehow got by with no lasting consequences and ended 1st year with good grades. Keep telling myself I've learned my lesson, but in reality I clearly haven't because I keep turning stuff in late. Mental health may be a factor but I feel like I'm already addressing it all I can (counseling, medication, accommodations). Just left huge summer project until last minute because I didn't prioritize correctly. Turned it in unfinished. Working on finishing but no idea if it will matter or how much longer it will take me. Have to pass said project in order to move on to comps at end of 2nd year. Committee is meeting to figure out what to do with me. Super frustrated and feel like maybe I just don't want this enough. Very bothered by the bad reputation I know I am building. Not sure if I should cut my losses and move on, or keep going. Can you come back from something like this or am I forever going to be looked at as a shitty grad student?

Is there any way I can make this less awkward/difficult/dangerous for me?","As you can guess, my relationship with my PhD advisor is not great. 

Things were rocky from the start, and I considered giving up a couple of times. I didn’t, and powered through my PhD research mostly on my own and with a network of collaborators and mentors. 

When it came to defining my research topic initially, my advisor never gave me any idea of what he wanted me to focus on, but disliked the general direction of what I suggested.
After more than six painful months of going nowhere, I defined a topic similar to what I had studied in my masters thesis, and got in touch with prospective collaborators that wanted to work on it with me. He seemed fairly happy with that, but directed me to work with more local collaborators, which I did.

My supervisor not only continued to refuse to give me any guidance towards a topic he was more familiar with, but also made zero effort in understanding how my specific field works. It is not so distant from what he does, but enough that it would take him some interest and reading to get what the field is about, and what are it’s main research questions. 

But his lack of interest is so, that every time I give a seminar, I feel like I am explaining to him what my whole field is about, instead of sharing my own results. I know it seems crazy, but at this point I feel like he willfully forgets what my research is about every couple of months. 

He is a co-author in one of my articles, and while all others provided me great insight and contributed significantly to improve the quality of the manuscript, his comments were mostly questions that could have been answered by a little bit of reading. 

To explain how this is possible: this is an interdisciplinary department, and most people don’t work with exactly the same theme as the PI. But this shouldn’t be an excuse, in my view. My masters supervisor also didn’t work in my field, but he became acquainted with it super fast, and together we managed to make a significant contribution to it by joining our expertise. In an interdisciplinary field like mine, this is usually a strength. But with my current supervisor, I feel like I am being dragged down. Needless to say, I struggled a lot and because of all of this I had a really hard time in terms of mental health during the whole process.


But things are going well now, I am publishing my work, and I feel like I am going to submit soon. 

But what should I expect from my defense? Does any of you have an experience with how this would look like in a panel, while I have to defend my work?

I am sorry if this is not well explained, I can provide answers in the comments. I don’t want this to be too easy to identify, but it is a bit of a very peculiar situation. Also, I am sorry if I sound utterly bitter... it’s because I am.",6,2019-04-06 03:49:32,AskAcademia

* asked for time off for a religious holiday, initially asked for two days off for the event and was met with ""the school is monitoring you - so two days off wouldn't look good."" After speaking to a masters supervisor, I realised this was a lie. ( the school doesn't monitor you, and I had annual leave so I could take the days off)
* Berated me in front of an intern for being late to a meeting with them, despite the reason for being slightly late was attendance to a health and safety meeting which was necessary ( as we had an upcoming audit) and had texted in advance to inform where I was. 
* Refused to read a full draft due to minor errors ( that I didn't think were a priority as they could quickly be dealt with - i.e. table heading was below the table instead of above it) and claimed me making mistakes like that showed that I hadn't learnt anything. Went on to say they didn't know what I was doing with my time, that they didn't think I was going to pass, despite the full draft being there, and that I was being given a stipend so I should work etc. As well as saying if I'd submitted that it would go straight in the bin ( it was a draft so I would never submit it as it was).  At this point, I had worked consistently on this report to ensure it was all in so the comments were very unfair, and I said so.
* When asking for a leave of absence ( doesn't affect my research but means I'm given no stipend) to deal with mental health and burn out as a preventative measure, I was met with ""I should try being more positive"", ""maybe its not the right time for you to do a PhD"" and a comment along the lines of you took a break in easter so why is it you need to take a break again as these issues shouldn't 'carry-over'.

Though I understand that things said may be well-intended, situations could have been handled more professionally and I feel I don't know how to proceed. These comments have taken their toll on me. I don't want to quit as I do genuinely enjoy my project though experimental failures and imposter syndrome have gotten me down. However, at times, I genuinely believe the environment has become toxic, and I have tried to address issues, but it doesn't seem to be improving. I get the impression constantly that my work isn't good enough, and they seem like they've given up on me. I understand my work is not the best, and my experiments have failed, but I have powered through as best I can. Is there advice on how I could deal with the situation, should I look for another supervisor? Should I bring this behaviour up to the school office? Is this behaviour normal especially as they were understanding at the beginning despite the occasional clash? I feel what I'm going through isn't as bad as other horror stories, but I think I need help as it's gotten to the point where I dread any email from them and can feel myself actively wanting to avoid them. ",5,2019-09-04 13:34:38,AskAcademia

c21cn5,stringyfellow,t2_hes27,Advice on difficult PhD working environment,"I'm posting on here looking for some advice/encouragement, and also to vent a bit about my PhD experience so far.

I am just over 3 years into a PhD programme that is supposed to be 4 years but could take up to 5. Two major reasons that I joined the group I am working in is that the group is part of a larger research node working on similar stuff at the same university, and the group had developed a novel technique that looked interesting to me (not going into detail in the interests of anonymity). After arriving, it turned out that the benefits of both of these things had been fairly dramatically oversold. Firstly, my supervisor views the other groups working in the research node as competitors, and collaboration (or even scientific discussion) with the people I pass most days in the hallway is strongly discouraged. Secondly, the reliability of the novel technique turned out to have been oversold quite a bit, to the point where a significant portion of research time is just spent repeating the process. These reasons were the initial seeds of my discomfort in the research group, however the working culture is also fairly brutal, with what I view as a counter-productive amount of pressure for results, and little value for the active development of PhD students as researchers. The ethos is very much do things over and over again until they work, and taking the time to understand why they didn't work the first time is seen as unproductive. My supervisor is not abusive or anything, however they can be quite callous in the way that they treat their students and postdocs (as an example, recently a junior PhD student was sent to a fairly prestigious conference to present the results of a more senior PhD student. The senior PhD student wanted to go and it would have been good for their career, however they were not allowed to as it would have required them taking time out of the lab where they were generating nice results). It is also a fairly large group with a very narrow research focus, which means that they different projects people are working on have significant overlap. At one point three separate people where working competitively towards the same result. This creates an environment in which people are very cautious sharing ideas, and secrecy and politicking is common.

I have tried to raise some of my concerns and suggest improvements to my supervisor a couple of times, and on each occasion so far have been treated like my concerns were unreasonable. I disagree with this, as multiple people in the group feel the same way.

I have fairly seriously considered quitting multiple times so far, either leaving academia altogether or trying to move to a different group. I am now at the point where I have some ok results, some days the end is kind of in sight, but a few years of chronic stress is starting to take a toll on my mental health. I'm feeling pretty burned out, and I worry that if I keep pushing I might end up doing some lasting damage to my mental health. I know that psychological stress is to some extent par for the course in a PhD, but all the dysfunctional group dynamics layered on top of the usual PhD stuff feels like a bit much.

Does anybody have any suggestions or tips, things which helped them get through a tough time in their PhD? They would be much appreciated",5,2019-06-18 11:58:05,AskAcademia

I need to meet with the undergraduate program director to get approval and a signature before I can officially add the second major.

The problem is I have social anxiety and I'm terrified of meeting with the program director. She has a reputation for being nasty and rude, but I took a class with her once and she isn't really; she is just direct and doesn't take crap from anyone. I wouldn't be nervous if this was just a normal advisor, but she is very accomplished and I admire her a lot.

I don't know how to explain why I'm taking so long to graduate, why I didn't add the major until now, what my career goals are, why I never came for advising on class selection and why my grades are mediocre (mostly B's and B+'s).

6aw7fh,internthrowaway3000,,How to Admit a Lie to new PI,"I am spending the next few months doing a research internship at an institution separate from my undergrad. My PI is an awesome guy and I'm really honored to work with him and hopefully make connections and be able to return to his lab after I graduate this coming year. 

However, I lied during my phone interview with him. He asked if I had attended any other school, because there was a gap in my transcripts between my high school graduation and my current undergrad. I told him no and said I spent that time working. I did have a job right out of HS but I also did attend a different college. I flunked out after an unsuccessful suicide attempt that left me floundering academically and socially. The campus counselers were incredibly unsupportive and I lost my scholarship due to bad grades halfway through a semester, leaving me on the hook for thousands of dollars of tuition. I've been paying them back every month since (this was 5+ years ago) and I still haven't settled the balance in full so I don't have access to my transcripts. (I have confirmed this with my old school and they will not budge on the transcripts.)

How do I bring this up? I didn't lie intentionally on the phone, I just panicked because every time I get asked about my nontraditional college timeline I have flashbacks to a very dark time in my life. But since I omitted it in my application to work there that also looks bad. I feel awful and I have been anxious for months but I'm wondering if I even should tell him now and how to do it. The internship starts in three weeks and I'm worried he will not want me to work there anymore and won't trust me. I am in a much better place now and I also don't want him to think I still have serious mental health problems - I went to therapy and everything and I am not clinically depressed anymore.

64z5ju,FedorianGray,t2_10qm5t,Institutional Research-What is the work like?,"Some background info- I hold a MS in Mental Health Counseling. All of my internship and professional experience has been in higher ed, working directly with college students. I recently experienced an ""awakening"" of sorts, and am looking to pursue my original career interest: research. To that end, I am pursuing another graduate degree in ed psych with a heavy focus on quantitative methods and statistics. 

I am currently working in higher ed as a student support specialist. I work primarily with students on academic probation. I do not mind the work, but I would definitely like to find work that allows me to conduct research and work with data. I do enjoy working in higher ed, and I would like to stay in this field if possible. I figure that institutional research may be a good fit for me, as I would still be working in academia, but I would be doing things that fit more with my goals and interests.  

So, my fine friends, are there any among you who work in institutional research? If so, could you please share with me some of the typical characteristics of the job? What does a normal day look like for you? What are some of your day-to-day tasks? What about it do you find rewarding? What do you find challenging? I would greatly appreciate any and all information that you could provide to me. 

Also, what kind of education/background/skills are essential to securing a position in institutional research? I suppose working in higher ed and having teaching experience are both things I have working in my favor, but unfortunately my education has given me very few research skills thus far (hence the second degree). Again, anything you can tell me about how to prepare myself for this type of career would be helpful.

8r5eac,throwawaytwoships,,"As a post-doc, how do I handle a PI being too hard on his students?","Using my throwaway in case this is identifying.

I started my second post-doc in the fall but am still close with the members of my last lab. The PI and I are friends, we meet at conferences a lot and catch up, and I learned a lot from him during my time (he respects his post-docs and treated me with nothing but care and respect). I also became good friends with many of the students, including one of his MSc students who is the subject of this post. During my time there (and during this post-doc to be honest), I struggled to find balance between being there for the students as a mentor and helping them navigate academia including helping them understand the PI's criticisms and suggestions, and also being an experienced scientist in the hierarchy of the lab and totally understanding my PI's point of view when it comes to the students' struggles or performance. 

The MSc student in question has had a particularly rough time with the PI. Her project is especially difficult and a bit outside of the PI's wheelhouse, such that he demanded results from her that were pretty unreasonable (to me at least) given the techniques she was using and her experience level. She worked her ass off, pulled all-nighters, and did her best with the demands and the time/resources she had, but it never seemed like enough for him. I saw in the lab and was able to see the nitty-gritty of it, her tears and struggles as she tried to keep him happy. After every meeting she had with him, we had to take a walk or close the office door because she would break down sobbing. I have had many life discussions with her trying to talk her down and help her through this time. The kind of language she told me he was using to communicate his disappointment with her is pretty brutal (ie. ""this isn't good enough,"" ""you don't belong in science,"" ""this isn't worth my time to read"" ""you should know better,"" ""how could you think this was ok?"" ""you aren't very good at this"" etc etc). She has a history of mental illness, including depression and anxiety and confided in me that she had attempted suicide before starting grad school. Now after a long haul of nonstop issues with her project, she is finally writing her thesis. He expects that she will be giving him these perfectly written manuscripts for each chapter from the first drafts, but has not provided her with any sort of guidance on how to write a paper (she has no publications and no experience with this). He expects that his students will instinctively know where to look for resources and will by some kind of miracle or brute force learn how to write. His edits to her chapters have been vague and unhelpful (for example, highlighting entire paragraphs and commenting with a single question mark with no explanation), and she is on a tight deadline to get her thesis done. Every step has been a struggle for her and he has been of little to no help, and frankly, barely a mentor. I should note that of the 6 graduate students he has seen through writing and defending (her included), he has had major issues with 5 of them (to the point of the PI and student not being on speaking terms anymore). 

From a purely scientific perspective, I agree with the PI that she could have managed her time better, that writing might not be her strong suit, and she could use some guidance with refining her experimental design. However, I absolutely DO NOT condone the approach he has taken to supervising her. Shaming students into performing is such an old-school way of going about things, and while he may have come up in this system himself, he doesn't seem to comprehend the effect it can have on well-being and mental health. While I was still there, she had a particularly devastating meeting with him where he told her she was worthless and that he was so disappointed in her, etc, and she went home feeling suicidal. I had to call her to make sure she was ok. The next day I went to see him in a closed-door setting and explained to him that he should be careful with the way he talks to her (while not giving anything away that would violate her trust). He brushed me off saying she was too sensitive and ""that's just how it is in science."" On the sidelines I have done everything I can to help support her, both in the lab with her experiments and writing, to outside of the lab as her friend.  

Ultimately, what is my responsibility as her friend and as a past member of his lab? Would I be out of place getting in touch with the PI and talking to him about his supervising style?

gza24h,dinosaurlaw,t2_6pipv54y,Wannabe Humanities Academic is Really a Lawyer. Please Advise.,"Academic redditors, I'm badly in need of some advice. I have tried to make the following concise, but Tbh it's a rant. Bless you if you read this and thank you for whatever time you spend treading into the semi-sinkhole of the last six years of my life. And I'm so sorry if this is not the right thread. 

Background: 

I, (29, F, USA) , graduated from a big state research school in 2014 with degrees in English and Film (stunning pragmatism). I applied to PhD's in English. My interests were drama and film/ critical theory.  

 I got into UNC, Tufts, and a handful of partially-funded masters. 

My boyfriend, who was also enrolled in a PhD program, and I worried about our relationship long-term if we both eventually miraculously succeeded on the academic job market. In a move that now makes me super-cringe for de-prioritizing my own goals, I panicked, applied to law school, got into a top 15 school, and decided to go.  

Essentially:  Yes, it was a phenomenally dumb reason to go to law school. No, I shouldn't have done it. Yes, I should have dropped out of law school. No, I didn't. Yes, I super-hated the next three years. 

Law school has, in so many ways, a reverse-mentality from academia. The goal is to 1. teach students the law and 2. teach students how to apply the law to the case at hand.  Anything outside the purview of those goals (for example, considering the historical or cultural context of a law) is simply not relevant. 

In law school, I found out that our legal system that has eroded fundamental rights, made corporations powerful beyond belief, and applies wildly inconsistent standards depending where you are in the country. None of my professors discussed how we got the current system, the role of our two-party system in the creation of these legal systems, or the ways in which legal policy might or should change. Not getting those questions answered in the law school, I  started taking cross-listed classes in public policy.

Through my work there, I found a passion for prison policy reform. I was able to visit prisons and juvenile centers in my state and learn about the ways that they are run and the human rights abuses that consistently take place within them.  

I studied abroad in Ireland and took graduate criminology classes.  I was bowled over with how interesting it all was. They were looking at the cultural and historical context of laws and policy across Europe. I got to visit Irish prisons and talk to some of the corrections officers and the people incarcerated there.  

I got back to the USA and watched the legislative session. I volunteered at a nonprofit doing prison reform work. Conservatives had suddenly started passing criminal reform bills after three decades of being ""tough-on-crime."" I started wondering about the ideological shifts that had occurred since 9/11 that allowed that to happen. 

I started to think about issues of prison visibility and representation in the media. Prisons and prisoners are shielded from view by walls and hidden away in rural parts of the state. I wondered how much your average American knew about prisons and how much media representations--fictional and nonfiction--influenced their views. 

I graduated and started working off my debt at a big firm. I loathed my firm work, but felt lucky that I was able to shrink my debt so quickly. I lived on ramen noodles, never turned on my heat, and paid off my debts in a year. After a year, my mental health deteriorated. I felt depressed and sad. 

Sitting at the firm at 5am, waiting for a document to come in from a client across the ocean, I started to wade into some scholarship. On Saturdays, before the inevitable email from my boss came in, I began to read. It was unorganized and scattered. I picked up Mbembe, Agamben, Foucault, Lacan, and Butler and then moved into more specific prison studies literature, critical legal theory, and critical race studies. 

Reading in the literature felt good in the way it had always felt good to move ideas around and construct arguments. But, with no mentorship, I felt frustrated by my inability to see the large structure of scholarship on crime and punishment. I considered applying to PhD programs. Again.  

Applying to grad school felt even dumber than before. The market would be even worse in six years. I was now closing in on thirty. My now-husband was on the academic market and might get a job in Kentucky and then what would we do? Besides, I now had literally no excuse for naïveté. I knew exactly how paltry PhD funding was. I knew about the catty politics. I knew about subjective standards and the stupid ways in which Ivy-league reputations still matter. I knew about how many people dropped out or were on the market for years in a row, indefinitely lingering in their departments until the funding was pulled. 

I put the idea of grad school away, again. I looked into criminal justice reform jobs. They are tricky to get for an attorney with no policy degree or no PhD. I got a couple of nibbles, but no bites.  

I quit my firm job. I started essay consulting for law school applicants. It was at least working with students, which I loved. It made nothing, but I was happier than at the big law firm. Then, Covid hit. My business basically evaporated.  

I feel so confused and frustrated. I want to just shut up and embrace being a lawyer who makes normal money, does a normal job. The idea of working in another firm makes me want to cry. I was so depressed, guys. So. Depressed.  And I feel like academia is haunting me. I know it's stupid to still hang onto this dream from six years ago, but it just won't go away. 

What would I even study? English? That seems weird, given the constellation of my current interests. I could look at post-45 depictions of incarceration in fiction, I suppose. Is American Studies still a thing anywhere besides Yale? I don't want to do the quantitative data analysis required in an American criminology department. UC Irvine has a more sociology-based criminology department, but I don't have a sociology degree. Or should I maybe look in media and communications departments? 

Maybe I should just get over my extreme social anxiety in writing to my professors from five years ago, apply, and see what happens? But then possibly departments won't even be funding candidates next year because of Covid. And my partner will be back on the market next year when his postdoc ends. 

I am trying not to just sit around and be a privileged whiner. I am doing some volunteer work for  justice reform organizations that are reacting to the amazing efforts by protesters to spur change right now. It feels good to use my degree, but I just can't scratch that academic itch. 

TLDR:  I still want a PhD. The legal market is basically dead right now. The academic market looks  dead right now. I feel like I am losing my actual mind over ruminating over this decision for a half-decade.  

I just really needed to type that aloud. I know no one can advise me about whether to go to a PhD program in the end, but if you have general advice or if my interests look like they might fit in a particular department, I would appreciate any advice.",4,2020-06-08 22:39:27,AskAcademia
az7tes,Komorebi-Sunshine,t2_390qhbi8,How to Research a Literature/Systematic Review?,"Hi everyone. I was given a task to do a literature/systematic review of any topic of my choosing related to psychiatry. I have decided to look at mental health prevalence, impact on the person and their close ones, and potential suggestions for future improvements in palliative/end-of-life patients. I have not done a literature review before and this is the first time of something of this kind. The word count needs to be between 2.5k and 3.5k words.

3e5lun,HumanDrinkingTea,t2_o4xhq,How do I go about getting into academia? Is it even possible?,"I'm a recent college grad in a performing arts field. Over the past few years I've grown increasingly interested in the idea of research, and I have a particular interest in the field of neuroscience. By the time I realized this I had already committed so much time and energy into my chosen major that I felt it necessary that I follow through on completing the degree.

Here's the deal: Now that I've graduated, I realize that all I really want to do is go back to school. But there are problems. The last time I took a biology class was about 10 years ago. I had time for a free elective at the end of my degree program, so I chose to take a statistics course. Unfortunately I suffered from Major Depression and anxiety, and found that my mental health was so bad that I was terrified of going to classes by the end and so it was more or less as if I had dropped off of the face of the earth (I am learning how to deal  with these problems via therapy and whatnot, but the F's on my transcript remain). I failed several classes, including statistics, and I fear that ruins my chances of anyone taking me seriously. To make matters worse, I'm pretty sure that my statistics professor along with me other professors would have given me a resounding recommendation up until the last 3 weeks of that semester. 

So... I have bad grades and an undergrad degree in a completely unrelated field to the one I'm interested in studying. How do I find a way to 1) Educate myself in the field that I am interested in, 2) Involve myself in research situations so that I know that it is the right field for me, and 3) Convince potential colleges that I am up to the challenge?

Here's what I've thought of so far: Do as much learning as I can on my own. Figure out relevant credits needed and take them at a community college. Ask people in the field what it's like working in the field and what they look for in those interested in getting into the field (but how do I find people?)

Whatever route I take, I know that it will take a lot of time and sacrifice. I really like the idea of volunteering in a lab, but is this even possible when one is not currently enrolled in a program? All the opportunities seem to be for current undergrads. I feel that such a volunteer experience might give me a good idea as to whether or not this is really a route I want to take.

Am I crazy for thinking I can change fields and become a research scientist when I already have an unrelated Bachelors degree, no experience, and questionable grades? I mean, I'm not made of money, so that's going to be a hurdle as well.

On the flip side, I am passionate about learning, I am a very good student and a quick learner when I am not affected by mental health issues, and I could probably get one or several professors to vouch that I have a strong potential for success in academia. 

So, r/AskAcademia, how do I make this happen? 

TL;DR

I want to make my dream of becoming research scientist a reality. I'm starting from square one. Where do I begin?    ",4,2015-07-22 03:22:44,AskAcademia

I just want your opinion(s) on what field I should go into If i wanted to make the biggest impact on Mental Health. I talked my to a neurology professor today and he said it would be better for me to do something in the psychology field as he doesn't see much research related to it in his field.

But I don't really know, there are a lot of people in psychology as is so I'm on the fence about that aspect and I personally have worked with a psychologist and it didn't really work for me until I worked with a psychiatrist so I have personal bias (I still do a lot of psych electives at uni).

Currently I'm doing an Economics/Science Degree (My First Year) in UNSW and as i've expanded my boundaries I've found some things that I somewhat obsess over. Writing and Mental Health itself. Which is why I've been taking screenwriting classes outside of uni and writing outside of uni to practice, I also am trying to volunteer for Lifeline's crisis center and volunteer for beyondblue.

I just feel like Mental health is my passion and if I could do research that was deadset on it I would probably be happy. But I don't know any labs that really do that and my psychiatrist said that if I wanted to do research on it, i would have to find a lab that either specialized in it or allowed me to do work on it.

I'm kinda stuck at an impasse. Should I just get a normal job and write or do research and write. I don't know what would help the most.

I'm currently a full-time master's student (in the humanities) at an Ivy League university, but I've found myself having serious doubts about joining the academia after one year in my program.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm probably just being naive, but my whole experience, so far, has been completely soul-less and soul-crushing. The work was difficult, as expected, but it took up so much of my energy that my mental health and social life suffered. I find the people to be arrogant and uppity, and most conversations end up being about who is the smartest person in the room. There's this constant pressure to be doing something important, whether it's sucking up to a professor or writing a paper for submission to a conference or journal. I honestly don't know if I can survive in the academia, and I don't know if it's because I'm lazy, or if it's because I made the wrong decision. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm supposed to apply to Ph.D. programs in the fall, but the thought of having to re-take the GRE (I've never been one for standardized tests, so I wanted to try for a better score - as an aside, I find it to be a complete insult to my intelligence, and the intelligence of anyone who has managed to make it to a master's program), write a statement of purpose, fine-tune my writing sample, and God knows what else all over again honestly makes me want to fling myself off a building. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I loved my field, and I think I do, but maybe it was a mistake to turn something I love into a career. Now, it just feels like a burden and a chore, and I have no idea what to do. I see my peers reading books and articles in their free time, expanding their knowledge, but I can't find the motivation to do any of that. I'm not sure if I should stick it out, at the risk of being miserable, or try to get out now. It's difficult to find jobs outside the academia in my chosen field, so I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. I've committed to one more year of study, and I think I would like to at least finish my degree, but I have no idea what to do from here.

21jwz9,[deleted],,"Considering not including my current in school in my transfer application and other advice (there's a lot of context to consider, hard to sum up in a title).","Hey everyone, 

I guess I'll get the missing context out of the way first. 

I hold an AA from a Florida state college, with a GPA of 3.4. And at the moment I'm applying to a few public universities in Florida (UF, FSU, UF, and USF -- all for a BA in English). 

However, I'm currently a recent transfer (as of fall 2013) to a certain university in the North Dakota due to a series of poor life circumstances and decisions which were not entirely in my control. 

I moved up here to get away from my family and in an attempt to get out of a terrible rut that had begun to sink my GPA (more details on this later). I was going on 21, already taking a year off of college after getting my A.A. in order to figure out what I wanted to do with my life before investing another two years, and a fair amount of money, into school. Before taking the year off, I had nearly failed all of my classes in my final semester(s) -- skipping classes out of depression, broken sleep schedule, various forms of self harm, etc. I wasn't in the best shape mentally by the end of my first two years, and there's a very obvious decline in my grades on my transcript.

So, as mentioned, I took a year off in order to just get myself together. I did enroll in some more (practical training) community college classes just to try to stay busy the following fall after my graduation, but that went as well as you would expect. I got a job in the latter half of the year and applied for UCF. 

I applied, but I was never accepted or denied. My application was stuck in bureaucratic hell; I would call the admissions department at least once a week, and would almost always receive some excuse as to why no decision on my application had been made yet, months after applying. This happened to a few people I knew during that application period, too. 

I had a friend who had moved up here, ND, for work, and offered me a place to stay and go to school, mentioning that maybe getting out of my parents' place would be good for my mental health. So, I took the offer, applied, and got accepted to the school here within three weeks. I was desperate to get out and finally get back into school after the shitshow that was UCF's admissions department. 

So, after a summer of packing up and moving out, I arrived up here. Got a job within two weeks, no problem. Ends up moving here wasn't a great idea, the job I had basically made full-time classes near-impossible, though that didn't stop me from trying, and my grades from that semester show for it. I quit the job for unrelated reasons a few months ago. My grades here have risen, but are not that much better, since moving up here really hasn't done much to solve my current mental health situation. If anything it's worsened it. I've been very reluctant to go get professional health, so this may be almost entirely my fault to begin with.

Also, the tuition is too expensive for me, and I have a lot of familial pressure to move back home rather than stay up here (at the moment I am, shamefully, still relying on some support from my family, and can understand, and even agree with, them wanting me closer to home). 

And here we are now. After all of this, I just want to forget this year existed, and re-apply elsewhere with my old state college GPA, which was at least respectable, so I can just finish already. I should've graduated this year, but at this rate it will be another two years till graduation due to this long chain of circumstances.

So, I'm not sure what to do regarding my applications. Should I include this horrible record and include what was written here as an explanation, or submit the better looking and cherry-picked transcript for my applications (if I can even do that at all)? 

For those who have actually taken the time to read all of this, thanks for any advice you can offer. ",4,2014-03-28 00:20:32,AskAcademia
6oxcbb,changeitifyouhateit,t2_an6ni,"Needing some perspective - is it plausible for me to ""redo"" college?","I apologize for the wall of text, but I feel it is important I provide full context. I want to make sure I am making the right decision. 

First, some background:

I grew up in a rural community and did very well in high school (high SAT scores, 4.0 GPA, numerous community leadership roles, etc). Not sure what I wanted to do career-wise, I questioned if I should jump into college right away. Due to an immediate scholarship/grant opportunity and the advice of family and friends, I decided to go to a great engineering school to study mechanical engineering (great career prospects with only 4 years of education).

My first year, all was fine academically. However, without any defined goals or passion for engineering there was a severe lack of motivation. My academic effort and performance eventually plummeted causing an unexpected decline in my mental and physical health. I temporarily dropped out of school without telling family. 

To save face and finish school with a degree/job, I immediately went back and switched my degree to accounting (again, great career prospects). Not having solved the initial dilemma I faced with engineering, the same cycle continued with accounting. After an extensive internship, I was offered a full-time position but realized an accounting career was far from what I wanted to do with my life. With mounting student loans and no motivation, I made the scary decision to end the downward spiral and leave school with 2 semesters left. 

That was 2 years ago. Although it was tough for family/friends to understand my decision and I am not better off financially for it, I feel confident it was the right thing for me. I am now much happier and in a MUCH better place mentally. I have been able to look back and see with clarity how I ended up making the mistakes I made, and I learned a lot about myself in the process. With a clearer understanding of my passions and motivations, I am now considering “redoing” my undergraduate experience, but I need to know if I am being realistic, hence, this post.

All my life I have had a passion for science. As a young kid, I remember saving all my money from mowing lawns and babysitting to get that next science book. That excitement never left and today I still spend part of everyday skimming a textbook, reading a publication, or watching lectures. Because it has been a consistent passion since I was little and I have had the time to look into the lifestyle it involves, I want to eventually do research in oceanography, more specifically, paleoceanography. However, this would entail getting a B.S. in a geoscience field and getting accepted into an oceanography PhD program. I have a good idea of the workload involved and the sacrifices that need to be made in order to pursue this, and I feel it’s the right path for me. 

My question:

The fear is that I go back to school and work my ass off for 4 years to no avail. Given my ugly college record, is it plausible that I could go after an entirely new career in research; would top school graduate admissions be able to overlook my past (two-time college drop out with poor transcript) if I were able to do well going forward (high GPA, research experience, networking, etc.)?

hu8hnh,bi_scotti,t2_2bov4cva,How to approach PI properly about mental health issues?,"Hi all, 

I’m a second year grad student in STEM and before I started grad school and into the first year, I was the target of emotional workplace abuse by a former coworker (still in my same department). It went beyond the standard belittling, isolating, spreading rumors, ostracizing and dipped into low key stalking and threats of suicide territory. 

Needless it say it’s really fucked with me. It’s taken me two years since it started to begin therapy (gaslighting really made me believe it wasn’t that bad/ my fault), but I’ve been making progress over the past couple months thanks to sessions around 2x per week and a low dose of SSRIs. The school psychiatrist thinks I have PTSD. 

It’s been bad enough to have an effect on my performance, though I’m just emerging from the cloud of chaos in my mind to see that objectively. I’m having some trouble paying attention to things sometimes or remembering things I should, I’m also always doubting myself. 

Although I was trying to be transparent with this to my PI (telling him vaguely what happened and that I was starting in SSRIs in case it affected me adversely for the adjustment period), I’m worried I wasn’t clear enough. On Friday he pulled me into his office after a practice presentation for my qualifying exam clearly frustrated that I didn’t seem on my game, that I couldn’t answer biological pathway questions I should know, just essentially making me feel awful and stupid. Not to say his frustration wasn’t valid, but I had really tried to preface my practice presentation by saying that I hadn’t had a chance to review all the background information yet (it’s still weeks until I have to do the official defense). 

I heard his frustration and told him I was sorry I disappointed him. I tried to explain more about how trauma can mess with your memory and that I was actively trying to address it with the help of the graduate school. I also tried to explain a bit more about how awful the situation was without being too dramatic about it. The last think I want is to emotionally manipulate someone into feeling bad for me. 

So my question is, is there a better way I could have gone about this? Is there a way for me to check in with him about my progress that might make things clearer for him? He is not a bad or mean person but is a member of the generations that seem to have less regard for getting professional mental help and more of the  “suck it up” attitude. I know I’m capable of doing good work and have the record to prove it, but this is something I have to address proactively in order to get back to my sharp productive self.

bpj6l1,tigermilk96,t2_bbcqf,Wondering if PhD in Clinical Psychology is viable for me (LCSW) / getting research experience after grad school,"Hello! I’m curious to hear about 1. Thoughts on strengthening chances of getting in a PhD psych program and 2. Completing a PhD with “life” stuff.

Current situation:
- Graduated MSW in 2014 (undergrad GPA 3.8, grad GPA 3.67). Licensed in California in 2017.
- Management and clinical experience (severe/persistent mental illness; community mental health).
- Pretty confident about letters of recommendation and writing skills for personal statement.
- Last took GRE almost 10 years ago without studying (4-5 writing and ~155 on verbal/quant; would study to try to bring up to ~160-165)
- Assisted in qualitative research for 1 semester during MSW program; not published.

I already love teaching but also know I would love to conduct research more seriously. I am concerned that this lack of research experience would be my biggest downfall in applying to competitive schools. I have tried to look for opportunities to volunteer my time to assist in labs but most things I have found locally seem to be for undergrads or grad students. I have considered emailing multiple local faculty members but not sure if this is the right way to approach it. **What options or strategies should I pursue to look for research experience?**

I am trying to stay in Southern California for family, however I also want to work into influential T1 research institutions. I am currently interested in UCLA, USC, or Berkeley. If these don’t seem realistic, I would be open to out of state then but not sure how that would work with family life...

Moreover, I am also somewhat concerned about investing 6 years into a degree while I am still trying to save up for a house (in expensive California...) and possibly have a child in a couple of years. It seems like many of my past professors say it’s very doable but it’s not easy lol. Just wondering what your stories might be.",4,2019-05-16 22:35:43,AskAcademia
bzw9yf,Caithmmir,t2_qm9qgu3,Am I making a big mistake?,"I've been accepted onto a PhD program in mathematics here in the UK, but I'm worried I'm making a big mistake by accepting it. I finished my undergrad a year ago, and I decided not to go straight into a MS/PhD program because A) I was burnt out and I was suffering from mental health issues, and B) I was very unsure of what I wanted to do, so I didn't want to jump into a big commitment like that.

However, over the last year I've done very little, which hasn't helped my mental well-being. I worked in a financial role for a couple of months, but I hated it and left after I was recently offered a PhD at my old university. But now I'm worried I accepted it impulsively as a way to get out of my job and to make sure I'm doing something, otherwise I'm scared I would fall into a pit of depressed inertia and end up doing nothing for months or even years.

I'm already in my mid-twenties, and I've been advised by PhD graduates to do it as soon as possible while I'm still young and don't have too many commitments, plus while I'm not tempted away by higher paying jobs.

The pros of the PhD program are:

1. It's well within my ability, so I know I will be able to complete (i.e. it's a safe option).
2. I was accepted onto it without a Master's, even though the min requirement was an MS (in the UK a lot of PhD programs require an MS, and even programs that officially don't require one still in practice only accept applicants with MS's, but the supervisor already knew me so they bypassed that). I doubt I'd get this opportunity again.
3. I know the area quite well, and I already have a social network there.
4. The area is pretty cheap, so I can afford to live pretty comfortably in a one-bedroom apartment (I'm pretty introverted, so I need to get away from people at the end of the day).
5. I already know the supervisor and get on with them pretty well.
6. It'll mean I'll only be in my late twenties by the time I finish, rather than being 30+ by the time I finish if I do a MS first and then do a 3/4-year PhD program at a higher-ranked school.

The cons are:

1. I already spent 4 years there, so I may feel bored, trapped or missing out if I stay there for another 2.5 years (I'll probably live elsewhere while writing up my thesis). It's a pretty small town, so there's not much going on outside the university.
2. The university's research ranking for mathematics isn't very high (it's not even in the top 30 for research quality in the UK). I've been told that the subject/research ranking of the university doesn't matter as much as your supervisor and their LoR, and after 5 years no one cares where you went. But I've also been told that there is an unspoken preference for higher-ranked schools in academia. Also, while no one may care about where you went years down the line, going to these schools may give you better access to academic connections in the first place, which propels your career forward while everyone else is left with the scraps. I've also heard that industry cares where you went to an extent, although the quality of your work is more important. I'm interested in working in the US in the future, so this might turn out to be a massive barrier.
3. I'm worried I'm not reaching my full potential. I have the grades for more 'prestigious' universities like Cambridge, Oxford, Ivy League in US, etc. (I got 85%+, which is equivalent of a 4.0 GPA), though this would mean I wouldn't finish until my early 30's if I went down these routes.

Am I making a mistake by accepting this? I doubt I would get onto a program like this again without doing a Master's first, so should I just accept the safe option? Or would it be better in the long run to do a MS first, then get onto a program at a higher-ranked university?

c0qfoe,unhappyessaymachine,t2_3y2u3ypx,"Feel like I am barely coping, ghosted my supervisor accidentally and now I want to ask her a favour","This is just for an Honours thesis, but I transferred unis for Honours so I don't know anyone involved very well. Backstory is that, last semester (at my old uni) I had horrific mental health that was in part circumstantial and in part due to ongoing issues. I was unsure if I'd be able to make the leap to a better uni, new city and higher level of study, but did manage all that. However, I quickly felt overwhelmed with the course load, and as a work opportunity came up, I switched my study load to part-time (1/2 full load) and am also working 20h a week. The Honours course I am doing is 50% coursework (4 subjects) and 50% thesis (two subjects worth twice as much as a normal subject). 

As a result, I ended up doing two coursework subjects this semester, and deferring the thesis until next semester. My plan was to continue working 20h a week, and next semester do my compulsory research methods subject and the first thesis subject (3/4 full-time study load). 

However, my current assessment of the situation is that, although my mental health is a lot better than last year, it would be a bad idea for me to try to work and do more than 1/2 of a full-time load. Without going into details, I still feel that I barely coped last semester (with 20h work and 1/2 full-time study), had a lot of panic attacks which were exhausting and generally high anxiety. I'm on the waiting list for public health mental healthcare (which I was previously accessing; ended up back on wait list due to moving cities). Also my grades, though I have only gotten one back, have not been that good, which is unusual for me (even very bad mental health hasn't typically affected my grades). 

As the thesis subject itself is 1/2 full-time, and I need to do the research methods subject before or during it, and the research methods subject is only offered this semester, my only options are:

a. Attempt to do that much study and work, or
b. Do the research methods subject and another coursework subject (total 1/2 full-time) and then do my thesis next year (1/2 full-time each semester).

I'd prefer to do the latter, as given my mental health issues I think a cautious approach to workload is better. However, unfortunately I'm worried that my supervisor might be upset at me, as:

a. I have already changed when I want to start my thesis once, so I'm worried it could be affecting her plans.
b. During May (when I was starting this new job, having a lot of panic attacks at work, and also volunteering on an election campaign) I accidentally didn't reply to her emails twice - - once because I genuinely missed an email and didn't reply for like three weeks, and once because I just completely forgot I hadn't replied and only realized 8 days later when she hadn't replied back to me. I feel especially bad about this as she was trying to arrange for me to meet an MA student she is also supervising, as our field is tiny so I'm the only Honours student in this specific major. Now she isn't responding to MY emails (for two weeks so far) and I tried to call her yesterday but she didn't pick up. 

Anyway, basically I feel terrible as I have accidentally ghosted my poor supervisor and feel terrible about it, and now I want to ask if I can change my plans for when I start my thesis, which I am worried will stuff up her plans, and I'm too scared to even raise the issue, especially as she seems upset at me as she currently isn't replying.

Does anyone know how to approach this issue? Based on my own view of my mental health, I would be extremely concerned if I started next semester doing 3/4 full-time study (including starting a thesis) and working. Cutting down on work hours isn't an option as I am supporting myself (as I've graduated from pre-Honours undergrad, I've been ridiculously lucky in getting this decent paying job with steady hours, which may be why the job is making me nervous as I always feel like I'm not doing well enough and have panic attacks during meetings).

## Wall of text

I'm going to **highlight** what I think my mistakes have been during the whole
process, as an indication of my current state-of-mind.

For those who don't know, a PhD in Germany has much less structure than in
other countries (particularly compared to the US). For all intents and
purposes, I'm really just a Research Engineer who is employed by the lab
to publish, collaborate on EU projects, and help with teaching. There are no
courses to take and no intermediate milestones to achieve. I'm not even
technically registered as a student yet. Excluding the PhD defense, there is
no-one who particularly cares about my progress except for me and my direct
supervisor.  Expected duration is 3 years, although it is not uncommon to have
it extended to last 4-5 year total.

Before my PhD, I had just graduated both BSc and MSc with honors, had my MSc
thesis published in a conference, and won ""best thesis of the year"" award from
a national society for my field. I had all the confidence a smart young person
in my situation could have. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at university, and
developed very early the will to pursue a career in Academia.  After
graduating, I was offered to stay as a PhD student in the lab where I developed
my MSc thesis, however, I opted to look for opportunities elsewhere. The
university and lab were good (KTH in Sweden), but I still wanted to explore the
world and continue travelling.

I ended up joining a young researcher who was going to be leaving his lab at
one of Germany's most prominent universities in Berlin to become professor at a
less prestigious university in south Germany. By the time I started, the lab
had only existed for 2 months, and I was only the 4th employee. I suppose this
was one of my first mistakes: **it was very naive of me to join a fresh/unknown
lab**. A leap in the dark which at the time I dismissed without much thought.

My experience as a PhD student broke me and destroyed my confidence. I quickly
went from being top of the class, to the guy who somehow can't get anything to
work.  The next three years went as follows.

## Year 1

Since this was the very start, most of the lab's focus was on getting things
started, organizing the first courses, etc..  I was left to find my own path,
and being inexperienced in concrete lab work, **I lacked the methodology** to
get things started right.  I was vaguely involved in an EU project which had
just entered its final year.  As a newcommer at the end of the project, I had
nothing meaningful to contribute.  I was in charge of some data collection (on
the last year of a project, you ask? yeah..) which I didn't really manage to do
because of some difficulty I had developing code for the multiple involved
hardware systems.  Nonetheless, it didn't really matter that I couldn't deliver
significant data.  Basically, I was just there to consume funding.

Towards the end of the year I injured my knee while running down the stairs to
catch a subway train.  It was nothing serious, but it put me down and led me to
stop running, which eventually had an impact on my mental and physical health.

## Year 2

This is the year where things got really bad. I became depressed for about 9
months and gained 20kg. **I did not seek help**, and in all honesty I doubt
anyone noticed. I am out of it now, although I still carry the extra weight
with me.

I enter a new EU project and end up patching up the data-collection from the
previous year. Data quality or quantity is not particularly good, but I do
finally start working on a subject using this data. Methodology is still crap,
since I developed none in the previous year and I am still left to find my own
path, so progress is still incredibly slow.  I manage to squeeze out one
publication near the end of the second year, but I'm not particularly proud of
that work.

I realize I'm failing my PhD, but **never consider quitting as a real
possibility**. I have a mind-block in place which makes the idea outright
absurd.  Also, **I lack the confidence and courage to confront my supervisor
more explicitly about my progress**.

## Year 3

Getting out of the depression, things become better. I end up getting
interested in a related but different subject, and my supervisor supports me
into switching direction.  During the course of the year, my methodology
improves, but **I'm still behind on all sorts of aspects**.

During the summer I convince S, my colleague and friend with whom I've shared
an office since the very start, to work with me on the next publication.  I was
thrilled to finally be collaborating with someone else, and to be part of a
team.  So far we are still a relatively small team, and internal collaboration
is rare. Everyone works on their own projects, and we only know each other's
work superficially. Our supervisor seems to be the only one who has a unified
vision of the lab's work.

We work together for a month and submit but eventually end up withdrawing due
to a bug in the model implementation which spoiled the results.  Right after
the submission, S announces he would be quitting his PhD after a couple of
months.  This was a small blow for me.  He had started just before me, and him
quitting made me question once again my own progress.

## Year 3 + 2 weeks

Last week I realized that I will not be able to make a deadline set by the end
of the month for a conference submission.  Althugh I am starting to find a path
and things have improved since the previous years, I feel like this would be
the umpteenth bump in my unsuccessful path.

I'm fairly confident that if I wanted I could let this slide together with all
the rest, and that I could eventually get another 2 shitty publications during
the course of another year or so, and I could get this PhD. But this is not the
reason why I wanted to work in academia, and I do not want to receive a PhD for
work which I'm not proud of, just because I eventually managed to publish n
papers.

I'm in good terms with my supervisor, he's extremely complacent (which in all
honesty doesn't help me).  The only fault that I can ever imagine laying upon
him is that he seems to restrain himself from giving explicit directions, but I
wouldn't do that; I am well aware that, as a PhD candidate, the onus is on me
to develop my own research.  He is currently away for business, but I will talk
to him about my doubts when he's back.

As things stand, I find myself am now in front of the following decision:

1. grin and bear and extend it (ignoring the fact that I have only published once in 3 years).
2. quit and look for another PhD right away.
3. quit and find some other occupation for 1-2 years, then find another PhD.

Writing this submission already cleared some of the fog in my head. If you spare some advice, I won't be able to thank you enough.",4,2016-02-14 20:14:01,AskAcademia
5bofwq,one_and_done90,t2_12ntp2,To finish my Master's/actual value of a masters degree,"So over the last year and half I've been working on a fully funded Master's degree in a highly specialized field of economics. Starting during my second semester I've been fairly miserable with a lack of interest in the field I'm studying, realizing I don't want to work in data analysis/economics as a career, and a large decline in my physical and mental health(gained close to 100lbs in under a year+had to see several doctors for sleeping issues/stress)

I'm also highly concerned about the actual value of this degree, there's only been one course in my curriculum that's been only graduate students, all the others out of the 30 credit hours have been mixed with undergrads and no special requirement/projects for the grad students. On top of this I feel like I haven't really obtained any skills that are really relevant towards a career even if I did want to go in economics, for example the program only goes into introductory econometrics but that's it. 

Now I'm having trouble trying to justify creating a thesis and finishing the next semester of classes since it really hasn't improved my career prospects all that much based on my job searching/hunting. I've talked to a couple professors I'm on good terms with along with family members and gotten a wide variety of opinions on what my next steps should be. I figure why not get the advice of the internet while I'm at it!

Option #1:  M.A. in Communication Studies from Texas State University.  I would likely be able to get a graduate instructor assistant position based on my email conversation with the department head.  That would pay for my tuition with a little left over.

I would pay out of pocket for tuition, but my husband makes a decent amount to cover us for a little bit.

Option #3:  Get a state teaching certification and try to teach business courses (particularly Accounting) at the high school level.  I have been considering this to be the least desirable option because I hear bad things about first-year teachers quickly burning out and leaving.

11ssu2,sadgrad1,t2_9d0bm,Quitting Question: Play Politics or Be Honest?,"Hello all,

Search for this, but didn't see a similar previous thread. 

I have decided to leave my program. I am no asking about whether I should or not. I have felt for a while that I am in the wrong department/field. This has led to general anxiety and at least at the moment, I want to leave academia all together (I want to go into NGO work/ or be a FSO).

My question is how I should go about it. I am a third year PhD in a humanities department. I have yet to take my prelims. I need to do this in order to leave with a Master's so the last few years would not be for naught. Yet this, like all things in graduate school, require faculty interaction. I see two possible routes:

**Playing politics**: this means I would put on a happy face and continue with the motions as if I were staying. The advantage to this is that faculty would probably be more willing to work with me (who wants to help a quitter?). I do not think my adviser would have a problem if I said I wanted out, but other faculty members are needed to complete the prelims (3 to 4). However, he isn't the most detail oriented person and probably doesn't know what the requirements would be for a terminal Master's so I'd have to talk to the director of graduate students anyway, thus stirring the pot--Academia is gossipy. Also, practically speaking, it is never good to leave a job without a secure back up plan. I recognize this, but the downside is I feel this ""posing,"" for lack of a better word, is putting a serious strain on my mental health. I have recently started taking advantages of all the services available on a college campus, including psychological counseling. My therapist has noted my extreme emotional response whenever I talk about my department. It's not that I do not like these people, I just do not feel like I fit in. The classes that I have enjoyed, and the professors with whom I have good relationships are all outside of the department (my field is interdisciplinary so this is encouraged, however these people cannot be on my prelim committee because that exam reflects your specialized knowledge). 


**Honesty**: This is by far my preferred route. I feel like posing is a waste of time for all parties involved. It has me applying to funding sources for next year that I do not even want and would not be able to use until I pass the prelims anyway. We are funded for 5 years but my ""dissertation"" would require me to travel so more money is needed for the hypothetical project--are you starting to see how this would make someone lose it a bit? The problem with this is that the requirements for the terminal Master's are not clear as state earlier (this is a PhD program and terminal Master's are for the booted).
I assume the work of a terminal master's would just be easier for both me and faculty. I am not lazy but by leaving, there are many other things I have to do in the next semester and a half (apply to jobs/fellowships for Master's Programs etc) to have a job/ path for next year.

So what do you think? Keep worrying about egos/departmental politics or secure myself a slice of sanity for the remainder of my time in grad. school?",3,2012-10-20 15:20:14,AskAcademia
bzmdnz,avatarvatar,t2_6gds6e0,Lack of a recommendation letter from my PI,"This is a long post.

Some background. I was a postdoc under the direction of a well known professor in the field. The PI has two totally different projects, and I was brought in to work on project A, which I liked a lot and it was well aligned with my background. After a year, the postdoc working on the project B left the lab suddenly, no matter how much I told the PI I was not interested in the project B and the project B was too different from my background, the PI still put me on the project B. I didn’t mind to learn a totally new topic, but the PI told me that there would be no chance for me to publish papers from the project B. I applied another postdoc position without including the PI as one of my references, unfortunately the other PI called this PI without letting me know, and even worse the other PI didn’t offer me the job. My PI got pretty upset, and kept telling everyone that I’m leaving the lab, and criticized everything I did, ignored my opinions in group meetings since then. After 6 months, I couldn’t bare it anymore, I decided to leave my job without a job offer. I also felt that I need a break to take care of my mental health.

I finally applied another postdoc, and I include another professor that I worked with during my postdoc as one of my references instead of my PI; however, the new PI still wants a letter from my old PI. I spoke to my old PI and asked for a letter. At first, the old PI agreed to write one, but then told me that he doesn’t have time to do so. What can I do in this situation?

gl06n8,ThrowawayAdventure3,t2_6hu9glz3,I Feel Like My Advisor is Delusional and I'm Losing My Mind,"Hello

I am currently stuck working on my thesis proposal. I know what the thesis will be, more or less inside and out. I have a committee, including 'important people in the field'. It's more than half done, I have most of the materials, I just can't push myself to finish it for a number of reasons.

The main trouble I have is that I think parts of it (parts that are really important for motivating it and pushed hard by my advisor and important to motivation to the thesis/funding) are largely 'crank-ish'. That is to say, I think they are really grandiose, nonsensical, and delusional. I can't make much sense of these claims when I actually look into the details of how it would work. When I ask him reasonably basic questions about the problem it is addressing, it's mostly apparent that he doesn't understand basic aspects of the problem and how they could or couldn't work. Generally speaking, I feel like someone working with a scientist from a science fiction movie where they say cool sounding future stuff, but when I look up what they're talking about it's mostly gibberish or reheated ideas that aren't quite coherent.

I have also had problems more than a couple times in the past where his skills/opinions don't line up with his claimed past in pretty brazen/flagrant ways. I don't want to get too specific, but stuff has been flubbed in ways that really shouldn't happen to anybody who isn't a complete beginner, and he'll get angry or deny it when I point out the obvious mistake that is happening. On the other hand, I can totally say the opposite as well, where I can say almost for a fact that he has to be brilliant in some categories, even if not when it comes to basic skills/critical thinking in others. This just makes things more confusing, since I pretty regularly hear things I know are 100% wrong or nonsensical in categories that are more well understood.

I really don't know what to do. Just trying to talk to people (including my advisor) over their egos is super intellectually exhausting to begin with, and now there is an added layer of me feeling potentially coached to pretend that what I'm working on makes more sense than it actually does or becoming delusional or a crank myself, which I really don't want. It's wreaking havoc on my mental health and sort of feeding itself as a problem on my psyche, and making it harder and harder to make progress. I don't want to get up in front of people and try to argue it's a good idea in ways that I don't think make sense, but I also want to get a PhD to make good on all the time I have put into this, and it's tearing me apart.

I am seeing a therapist/taking medication now, but it's only helping a tiny amount. I just really don't know what to do.",3,2020-05-16 18:59:53,AskAcademia

The honest truth was that I took an introductory proofs class my freshman year because I was an overzealous physics major who thought I could also pursue a degree in mathematics. I was enrolled in 7 classes at the time and am not used to giving up, however I realized that the teaching style was not enough for me to understand the content well enough to get away with just going to class. In order to do well I would have to read through the book and work extra problems, and this was time I did not have between all my other classes and research. This led me to withdrawal to spare my GPA and mental health. The highest grade you can earn at my university is an A+ and I came out with all A+'s that semester, so I guess this stands as proof of what I said.

I do not like lying and feel as if my reasons are not at all justified. Even after dropping the class I was still working around the clock for the entire semester and still felt run down and depressed at times, so I am being genuine when I say my mental health wouldve been detrimentally effected. I am afraid my reasonings will make me come off as a quitter when things get tough (something I cannot image most schools and programs are looking for). It is my only withdrawal and I see none happening in the near future, as I have learned my lesson the first time.

dcgb2e,FabulousOpposite,t2_26w8g9ss,Should I disclose my mental illness to my boss?,"\[Throwaway\]

Normally I am a huge advocate for disclosing issues to your supervisor, and believe in honesty and transparency. However, in this situation I'm not sure what to do because of the nature of my relationship with my PI, and I could use some advice.

I'm a postdoc starting my third year in the lab. This is my second postdoc. For the last several years I've been slowly coming to the conclusion that research isn't for me. I would like to remain in science but I really miss helping people and having an impact, so I'm leaning toward leaving this job when I can and pursuing something in the science education/communication/policy realm. 

In the last 10-12 months, I have really sunk into a deep depression that was triggered by a traumatizing faculty interview back when I thought academia was for me. It went alright but the leadup and prep for it nearly killed me, and really got me thinking whether academia is for me. It triggered my (at the time undiagnosed) depression to come on hard, and I finally after 20+ years of feeling this way, finally went to see my doctor, got diagnosed, and started taking medication. I have been trying different meds and going to therapy, and it has been a daily struggle. I've been having an increasing number of really bad days, and lately it has started to interfere with my ability to do my job.

Even without depression, I really hate this job. My PI is not a good person, he is a horrible mentor, and while he seems ok on the surface, his actions reveal that he is selfish, cruel, and manipulative toward his trainees. Every single person has left his lab with a fight/argument/issue. Obviously I am planning on leaving this job, but I have teaching commitments next year and I know my PI will make it difficult for me to leave (he holds papers hostage, he guilts people into staying, he punishes you for leaving ""early"" by piling on as much work as possible until you leave, etc). It's important to note that he tends to take out his frustrations in his reference letters, and wouldn't hesitate to write something to the effect that I left projects ""unfinished"" if I decided to hit the eject button now or in the next 6-12 months. I have not published yet in this lab due to the difficulty of my projects.

To make matters worse, my depression is making it difficult for me to find any reason to care about this job anymore. I loathe coming to work, I don't see the point of my work, I know I'm going to be leaving, and I just stopped really caring and trying. I am on autopilot when I'm at work and counting down the hours until I can go home. I do what I can in a day, but extra effort, enthusiasm, and long hours are absolutely not happening. Historically I've been high-functioning and been able to hide this problem to everyone, but lately it reads all over my face and I just walk around lifeless and sad. 

On top of all this, my projects have been extraordinarily difficult, even for someone who cared and had more skill than I did. I know at some point my boss, who is very hands off, will want some results and while I'm trying my best when I'm actively working, I know he won't be happy with the progress. He publishes in high impact journals and his philosophy is that ""you need fear to pressure people into performing"" (his words). That said, he is extremely hands off and also never asks personal questions (not even ""how have you been?"") so he won't have noticed or bothered to ask how I'm doing. He has never taken a genuine interest in my well-being or the well-being of any of his trainees. Once, I told him that ""I need a new project to protect my mental health"" and he told me that while I would be tempted to back off and take a break, that ""I should probably we working more."" This was extremely revealing, and makes me more afraid to let him in on what's going on. However, it's getting to the boiling point where I fear I will need a mental health break/leave (maybe just a week) if things progress this way, and at that point I'd have to tell him. 

So, the way I see it,  here are my options: 

1. Disclose my depression to him, PRO: weight off my chest, explanation for lack of progress, leeway for a break, CON: lack of empathy from boss, possible risk to my reference letter and retaliation
2. Not disclose my depression to him, PRO: I stay off his radar, no risk to my reference letter, CON: fear of having to explain myself to him as to why progress isn't going well, wouldn't be able to take a leave if I needed one

What should I do?

**TL;DR: My depression is affecting my ability to care about my job and put in more than the bare minimum effort. Should I tell my boss and risk it affecting his treatment of me and/or my reference letter?**",3,2019-10-02 20:49:57,AskAcademia

Hey Everyone,

Currently, I am planning to take a gap year (or two) after earning my bachelors in biochemistry before continuing on into either a masters or PhD program and I am in desperate need of some advice regarding jobs outside of academia.

I am a bit lost as of right now because my original intention was to go straight into a masters after undergrad, but do to mental health-related stress I feel like I really need a break away from academia to figure things out. I sort of realized too that since high school I have truly never had a chance to sit down and truly figure out what it is that I want to do in life. 

I’m mainly taking the time to also determine if I truly want to go for a PhD or not. I enjoy research and came to love microbiology in the past two years, but I still do not know what area of microbiology that I’d want to go into during a PhD program. I also feel that personally I shouldn’t consider a PhD program unless I’m 100% committed and I know that this is without a doubt what I want to do in life because I know it requires fucking commitment.

At the moment, I am curious to either work in industry or find a technician position. However, I am not certain too what types of jobs are even out there. The past few years I’ve worked solely at my university by being a teaching assistant. What I’d like the most is some form of job that will help me learn new skills and give me experience that I can use later in life, either outside or inside academia. 

My plan in the spring before I graduate is to take two courses that focus on the biology and chemistry side of industry GMP. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated and I’m open to any input.

Thank you!

I've also been dedicating a lot of my time to my classes and I've been doing well and I'm understanding the material, and I've been making it a point to talk to my professors and keeping on friendly terms with my TAs. I really think that I can get in the 3.75-4.0 range of GPA for my remaining time at UMaine.

I'm not dumb by any means, I just wasn't in the right mindset my freshman year and it took a lot of time and effort to improve my mental health. So now here's my question, I've really loved working with this professor on his research and I'd love to keep learning about genetics and one day conduct my own research, but is my freshman year going to hold me back too much? I've heard of people recovering from bad freshman years but I feel as if 2.5 is ridiculously low compared to what I think I'd need to enter a P.h.D program.

I plan on getting more of these research jobs, and I would love to get a job as a tutor and MLA (Maine learning assistant, they're basically undergrad teaching assistants here, but even if I get a 4.0 for my next 6 semesters, it only brings the average up to 3.62. I've been doing my best to be as involved in my major as possible but sometimes I feel like no matter what I do it won't be enough. Should I also join extracurricular clubs? are there off-campus things I can be doing to bolster my resume? I'm a hard worker, I'm interested in the subject, and I want to pursue this dream but I feel so behind compared to other people I know who are in P.h.D programs and I'm not going to a very selective school to begin with so I feel that hurts my chances.",3,2019-10-04 16:31:45,AskAcademia

 Byline: Jenny Rogers

For years, faculty members have pointed to the sluggish growth in the number of tenured professors and complained that university payrolls are filled with too many administrators. This, they maintain, adds unnecessary costs and takes the focus away from teaching and learning.

But whether such ""administrative bloat"" is really occurring and how much it matters on campuses are complex questions to answer.

To examine the issue, The Chronicle obtained detailed payroll information from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln for the past decade. The data help resolve the questions but pose more: Who really counts as an administrator? Are the jobs of librarians and student advisers academic at their core, or do they do more to fulfill technological or service-oriented functions? And just how many scientific illustrators, sewing technicians, and meat cutters does a university need?

The debate about counting faculty and administrative staff often takes an ""us versus them"" tenor, and in the conversation important nuance may be lost. Much of the growth has been in jobs that are not new layers of managers and administrators but rather in positions that provide a growing array of services to students, support research functions, and respond to changing technological needs.

The way that work has evolved on Nebraska's flagship campus, for example, has led to rapid growth in information-technology jobs and research staff, an increase in positions in sports and recreation and in campus security, and downsizing in the library.

Among Nebraska's 6,119 current employees, 29.3 percent are in faculty positions and 70.7 percent fill other kinds of jobs, working as administrators or staff members largely outside of the classroom. Those proportions haven't shifted much over the past decade.

The number of people working in administrative faculty positions, such as department heads, chairs, and deans, has actually declined, by 5 percent, from 2001 to 2012, a trend suggesting that concerns about bloat in administration might be overblown.

During the same period, the ranks of tenure-track faculty, not including administrative faculty, grew by less than 0.2 percent, while the number of faculty members working off the tenure track increased by 26.4 percent, a trajectory that gives empirical backing to the concerns of professors who say faculty influence on key university decisions is weakening. When administrative faculty are included, the growth in tenure-track faculty becomes a decline of 0.3 percent.

In recent years, the debate over administrative bloat has taken on more weight as public scrutiny of higher-education costs has intensified. Concerns about universities paying the salaries of too many administrators have been fueled by worries about the increases in college and state budget cuts, which have forced the downsizing of academic programs.

Symbolic Debate

In some ways, though, the conversation about what would make for the best administrator-to-faculty ratio is as much a symbolic debate as a budgetary one. As the number of administrators increases, and the proportion of faculty working off the tenure track grows, some worry that faculty are becoming marginalized.

""There was a time when the university was its faculty,"" says Jane Wellman, executive director of the National Association of System Heads. ""A lot of universities really kind of talk about themselves that way. That's your biggest asset, your brand, that's who you are: your faculty.""

No one disputes the importance of the faculty. But, Ms. Wellman says, the increasing number of nonfaculty members at universities may be a new reality, one that incites those professors and researchers who feel that a university should be guided more by the people who are directly involved in teaching than by those who are supervising or supporting the instructors.

At Nebraska, the number of jobs that directly involve teaching has increased faster over the past decade than the number of positions that do not directly involve the classroom. But, amid budget reductions that have led to program cuts in recent years, the sheer size of the nonteaching ranks still troubles some professors.

""There's a lot more people sitting in a lot more desks,"" says Michael W. Hoffman, a professor of electrical engineering. If a university is an organism, he says, the students are the lifeblood, the administrators a disease, and the faculty the immune system. ""While it's a joke,"" he adds of his metaphor, ""there is perhaps more than a kernel of truth in that.""

In 2011, Nebraska eliminated three academic programs -- a graduate degree in classics, an undergraduate program in industrial engineering, and the elementary and secondary art education program -- to absorb budget cuts. At the time, Christopher Marks, an associate professor of organ studies, found himself and his program on the chopping block, too.

Eventually an academic-planning committee recommended that the organ stay at the university, and Mr. Marks with it. ""The message is what you're teaching isn't valuable anymore,"" he says of the cuts. ""That's horrible for morale.""

Now with tenure, he feels more secure at the university, but the increasing number of nontenure faculty worries him. ""I understand the economics behind it,"" he said, ""but I think it's too bad that economics are driving all of the decisions.""

The university added a new category of faculty job in 2007, the professor of practice, a contract position designed for people who wanted to focus on teaching rather than research. This year there are 80 such professors. But administrators now want to increase the number of tenure-track professors, by as much as 20 percent by 2017, says Ellen Weissinger, senior vice chancellor for academic affairs. She wants to see tenure-track professors increase in number and in percentage of all faculty.

Even when academic programs aren't in danger of elimination, ""administrative bloat"" can be an issue, says Jonathan Robe, a research associate at the Center for College Affordability and Productivity. ""It takes away resources from the research, teaching, and public-service mission of the university and diverts them to other areas of spending that don't have a direct relation to those core missions,"" he says.

Ms. Wellman, though, says the cost of adding administrators is simply not significant enough in universities' overall budgets to be the cause of increasing tuition or higher-education costs. At the University of Minnesota, for example, the cost of administrative oversight accounts for 9 percent of expenditures.

Different Conclusions

The Platte Institute for Economic Research, a think tank in Nebraska, commissioned Richard Vedder, director of the Center for College Affordability and Productivity, and two of his colleagues, including Mr. Robe, to analyze staff trends and the value of the University of Nebraska system for students. The institute's report, released in May, criticized the system for having high administrator-to-faculty rates compared with national averages and for having low four-year graduation rates compared with peer institutions.

The study found that American universities have an average of 17.34 full-time-equivalent staff but only 6.21 full-time-equivalent faculty per 100 full-time-equivalent students. The Nebraska system has 20.34 full-time-equivalent staff and 7.07 full-time-equivalent faculty per 100 full-time-equivalent students. The report concluded that, with a relatively large staff and a relatively low graduation rate, the university system was not providing a good value for students.

Mr. Vedder says he joked at the time of the report's release that if he stretched all the system's excess administrators end-to-end, they would extend from the steps of the state Capitol across the Cornhuskers' Memorial Stadium football field. ""Everybody laughed,"" he says. ""But no one disagreed with my calculations.""

However, James E. McClurg, chairman of the university system's Board of Regents, did object to the study. In July he released a statement noting the 5-percent drop in the number of administrative employees. The university, he added, had made $76-million worth of budget cuts since 2000 to try to keep tuition as low as possible.

Nebraska administrators say they hold important roles in facilitating the work of professors and students. They fight the image that ""administrator"" is a bad word, and take pains to point out the ways in which administrators are professors and scholars, too.

""There's a conception among some that administrators aren't doing anything,"" says Harvey Perlman, Nebraska's chancellor. ""The problem is if it's work that has to be done, then somebody's going to do it."" That could mean anything from taking out the trash to making sure the university complies with research regulations. If administrators aren't there to do it, Mr. Perlman says, the burden of the work falls on the faculty.

The details of how employees are counted and categorized can make a big difference in how wide the faculty-administrator divide appears.

It's difficult to come up with a universal answer to the question of what exactly an administrator is. Some observers consider only top-level administrators, such as chancellors and vice chancellors. Some count all supervisory roles as administrative jobs. Others categorize all nonclassroom personnel as administrative staff.

The wide array of jobs in the non-faculty category, and the many reasons for growth in different positions, also complicate calculations about whether the rise in employment outside of the classroom signals something good, bad, or otherwise about the direction of the higher-education workplace.

At Nebraska, nonfaculty jobs include computer programmers, instrument makers, and mail carriers. Over the past decade, the number of jobs with ""director"" in their titles has been cut in half, to 34. Meanwhile, research staff doubled, technology jobs grew by nearly 80 percent, and student-life positions increased by 53 percent.

The university's research staff has expanded as its research expenditures grew, from $136-million in 2000 to $232-million in 2011. As compliance regulations have grown, so has the staff, along with the numbers of postdoctoral research associates, research/agricultural associates, and nontenured research faculty.

On the Lincoln campus, as elsewhere, technology experts are now needed in numerous departments. Enrollment offices have added digital-recruitment tactics, libraries have added software systems to track books, and researchers are doing more technology-intensive computational work.

Student services, meanwhile, have grown as the university has hired more advisers and career counselors. Where there were once 16 advisers, in 2001, there are now 31. They're joined by dentists, mental-health practitioners, and sports-and-recreation specialists, all hired to respond to students' changing demands, says Juan Franco, vice chancellor for student affairs.

""If we focus on some other basic needs, like housing, dining,"" Mr. Franco says, ""if we do that -- and I think we're doing a good job -- then they can focus on their academic subjects much easier.""

Monitoring Bloat

In an increasingly complex university, critics of evaluating the campus workplace through calculations of faculty-to-administrator ratios say, the ""us versus them"" nature of the debate doesn't account for the diversity of campus roles or the individual missions and environments of different universities. The employee roster for Minnesota, for instance, includes one captain and two chief mates for a university research vessel on Lake Superior.

The one aspect of the debate that most agree on is that administrative growth should be monitored. If universities were more transparent about their staff data, the debate could be more informed and constructive, says Mr. Robe, one of the authors of Mr. Vedder's Nebraska study.

Minnesota is one institution that wants to better track its own campus work force as it looks for ways to become more efficient. After Eric W. Kaler became the university's president, in 2011, he urged staff to put a high priority on analyzing hiring data by job title, and to set spending and staff size benchmarks against which to measure the university subsequent performance. The goal, says Lincoln A. Kallsen, director of financial research, is to use the analysis in the budgeting process.

Over the past 13 years, data from Minnesota show significant increases in technology, research, communications, and student-services staff, similar to the trends at Nebraska. The number of directors, which peaked in 2008 at 988 positions, has declined in recent years, to 969 in 2012. That number is still higher than in 1999, when there were 529 directors.

Taking a closer look at who the university is hiring will help keep tuition increases under control and may help reallocate some money from jobs that are focused on administrative oversight to those centered on teaching and research, says Mr. Kaler. Showing and increasing the university's efficiency, he says, also could help the institution's case before state lawmakers.

To help the analysis, Mr. Kallsen and a cross-departmental team are looking at making job titles more descriptive. A ""coordinator"" might in the future be a ""coordinator of"" something specific, he says, answering more clearly the question, ""What do administrators actually do?""

When administrations begin analyzing themselves, they bring agendas to the table, some observers say. Mr. Kallsen's team decided from the beginning that they would let the numbers speak for themselves, without reclassifying or ignoring any data. They wanted their analysis to be truly objective and, in a way, as pure an academic undertaking as possible.

""Just because it's complex,"" he says, ""doesn't mean you shouldn't try to understand it and explain it.""

How Jobs at Nebraska's Flagship Campus Have Changed Since 2001

Among the 6,119 current employees at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, close to 30 percent are in faculty positions and just over 70 percent fill other kinds of jobs, working as administrators or staff members largely outside of the classroom. Those proportions haven't shifted much over the past decade, but some categories of jobs are growing much faster than others. Communications jobs and the ranks of professors of practice -- contract positions off the tenure track -- are among those rising the quickest. Administration and business positions have declined, meanwhile, and the number of faculty on the tenure track has increased only slightly.

In my home country, an MPhil is generally a research masters degree between a taught masters and a PhD. It's generally viewed as a helpful stepping stone between taught and research degrees and most people take it up only to pursue PhD immediately afterwards. 
- Is it the same in the UK, or does the MPhil count as an independent research intensive masters degree? 

- If I decide to not join a PhD program and exit after the MPhil, will this reflect poorly on me when I'm applying for jobs? 
While I do want to do a PhD eventually, I can't yet predict whether I would want to do it immediately after my MPhil or if I'd like a break to work in between.

I feel fairly pessimistic about transferring anywhere with my transcript, and while there's a chance my previous institution might take me back in if I can demonstrate an improvement in my mental health, that's no guarantee, and I might not relieve all the financial support/scholarships I needed to afford this institution to begin with.

juvnh5,disorderedfiction,t2_88shv5su,I keep becoming infatuated with my professors to the point that it is painful. How do you manage this? My passion for the subject inevitably bleeds into the relationship.,"I’m terrified of grad school and having a thesis advisor because that relationship is even more intense. I’m only an undergrad right now and already feel a too-intense bond with many of my professors. 

It’s gotten to the point that I’m afraid to take any  classes I am passionate about if they are taught by a male professor because I know I will inevitably “fall in love” with them, no matter how old or unattractive they seem to me at first. Even a female professor. It doesn’t matter. I think I know why this happens, and my professors really are usually wonderful teachers (I go to a small, prestigious liberal arts college). I’m passionate about learning and the subjects they teach and I don’t feel very supported by my parents. I can see how it is used as defense against loneliness and depression, and how mania obviously plays into it. But it doesn’t do much to stop the feelings, which I’ll never act on but which are begin to crush me. I think they began in a pure and innocent and even beautiful way so I’m reluctant to completely ignore them, or cast them aside. How does something so innocent as genuine admiration for a teacher turn into something so dark and painful as obsession?

This current infatuation started three and a half years ago and I’m still deep in it. I haven’t seen him in over a year (I took a leave of absence for mental health reasons) and I’m crying over it. Quarantine may be making it worse. I feel a lesser version of this toward nearly alI of my male professors and I know even if I get over this one it could easily happen again. 

At first, with my current infatuation, who is 30 years older than me and married (and also my professor and advisor) I didn’t even I was becoming infatuated at first. I just admired him and enjoyed listening to him. A lot. He was so unlike anyone I’d ever met and his enthusiasm for literature (which I’m also very enthusiastic about, as an English major) just lit up the room. It also lit a fire in my soul. It’s hard to explain but it really did. It energized me and I still feel warm and fuzzy all over just thinking about it. It’s not lust I swear (he is almost 60 and balding, though still cute and well dressed!). It had almost nothing to do with sex at first and everything to do with his energy, his quirkiness, his charm, and mostly, the way his brain worked. The things coming out of his mouth were unlike anything I’d ever heard before. He could also tease out the complicated twistings of my own mind and quickly grasp and articulate exactly what I was trying to say, or what I was thinking, in a way no else had been able to do before. It made me feel less alone in my thoughts. I could babble in my way, and when most people furrowed their brow or ignored me, he’d get excited and reflect back to me exactly what I was trying to say. I remember feeling once, after a discussion in office hours, that I’d had a real conversation, a tête-à-tête, a meeting of minds, for the first time in my life. The thick fog of bias and projection that normally separates people from really seeing each other seemed to have been lifted, temporarily, or perhaps our individual projections just happened to, in that moment, perfectly align with reality, so that it felt like there was no barrier to communication. It was a strange and exhilarating conversation, about the book we were discussing in class, but also about life and ourselves, and our thoughts seemed to be flowing back effortlessly though we were interrupting each other and speaking in choppy, half sentences and metaphors and silences. Yet there was an understanding of so much, with so few words, as if whole novels worth of ideas and feelings were being passed between us effortlessly. I will never know if he felt the same. Likely, not, but perhaps a bit. He told me during that conversation that it was like “finding a glass of water in a desert.” I still don’t know what the it was exactly referring to (though in that moment it made perfect sense to me). That’s exactly how I felt about that conversation. 

Even just writing this now my heart is racing. Suddenly, I didn’t have to be alone in my thoughts anymore, he tolerated and understood my all the paradoxical things  swarming in my head, all the cognitive dissonance, all the conflicted feelings. He was smart and fascinating and I wanted to learn everything I could from him. I worked hard to impress him and to show him how much I was learning from him. And it worked. But when he started praising and encouraging me and treating me a little bit “special” it felt so good I became even more attached. But by that time he was already my advisor and I’d taken multiple classes with him and “fallen in love” with his field of study. Long story short my feelings for him grew and grew over the next three years into something no longer appropriate for a student teacher relationship, or perhaps any relationship. Even my completely platonic feelings of admiration and excitement became too intense and almost creepy and unsettling to others. So I had to, and still have to, constantly hold back not just my inappropriate longings for emotional intimacy, affection and mutuality, but I have to constantly hold back and restrain myself from expressing all of the normally good and “appropriate” feelings overflowing in my heart, like gratitude, admiration, affection, eagerness to learn and, yes, Iove, because somehow in me, all those good things have become so intense that they turn bad. People find it unsettling. The difficulty of keeping it all inside is perhaps even more painful and exhausting than the inevitable lack of reciprocity or impossibility of mutuality (he is my professor, advisor, married with children, and over 30 years older than me), though that is quite painful too, in it’s own way. I know that it can never be and I have no hope for a relationship yet I still find myself enamored and thinking of him and his brain and his family and wondering who he is, time and time again, four years after first meeting him. Last night I cried for hours after thinking about him. I’m not quite sure what exactly I was crying over except how exhausted I was, and how intensely I felt about him. I don’t even want to be in a relationship with him. I just love him. 

I thought infatuation was only supposed to last 6 months, especially when you aren’t in a relationship with them? What is going on? 

I feel as though crushes are something you are supposed to enjoy, but why can’t I just enjoy this one? I am afraid to even allow myself admire anyone anymore lest it turn into this. Even when my professor is supportive and encouraging and reciprocates as much as they possibly can within the limits of propriety, why can’t I just be grateful and enjoy the good feelings? I don’t even know why I feel so much pain around this anymore it doesn’t make sense. It’s like it’s triggered some deep, primordial longing that can never be satisfied by any mortal. I want to accept it, and move on, and I often just sit with the pain and meditate or even try to distract myself but it’s not going away. Is this what life is supposed to be like? Will it ever go away?

The scary truth is that I KNOW this will happen again. It’s never been quite this painful or long lasting before (partly because this time I perceived, perhaps incorrectly, some signs in the beginning that he also felt something toward me), but it has happened with female as well as male teachers since 10th grade. 4 total, one at a time, usually lasting over a year. With every new object of fixation however, it seems to be  becoming more and more painful, and less and less pleasurable.

I wanna say thank you to all of you for making me feel less alone and giving me the strength to make this decision. I always thought that I’m useless and unworthy, but I feel a lot better after hearing your stories. I hope I will bounce back from this setback and become stronger. 

If you ever experience the same thing, do whatever you need to stay sane. 

Stay safe everyone.

dckxpc,colbaltmoon,t2_4h8noba9,Explaining a transcript to a professor you're trying to do research with?,"Hi, 

I'm at an economics research assistant at a top 3 university in the U.S. and I've had some free time outside of my work. I'm planning on applying for a PhD / JD and recognized a professor who's gone down that path at a public economics seminar. I approached him and we connected, and he later asked me to send him my transcript, which I assume is to get a sense of my background and whether he has the capacity/research project for me to help him out with. 

My sense is that he seems willing to mentor me. I am, however, kind of embarrassed by my transcript. My first two years in college were not great for various reasons such as undiagnosed ADD and mental health, but of course these are not excuses. My next two years are good, but weren't straight A's and A+'s with a couple A-'s and B+'s thrown in there as I overloaded in coursework. 

Is there a proper way to kind of disclaim this to him? How much would he care? I've had my research presented at conferences, computer science research experience, and have had an impressive resume. I've done a lot of ""outside"" work, like projects in computer science and statistics or self study and reading. I can talk the talk, and have a decent writing sample, which is how I landed the job at a top university. I've been feeling like an imposter here though because of the transcript, and worry about how to approach situations exactly like the one I've just described.

Thank you!",3,2019-10-03 02:49:20,AskAcademia
6w9isv,BornOn8thOfJuly,,Would you tell a professor if you had bipolar disorder?,"I'm a doctoral student. I have bipolar disorder.

As some context, I'm e-mailing a professor to see if I could audit her class. I am currently registered, but I have some publishing commitments and hoped to be all but dissertation by the end of this semester. However, her course would be useful for a chapter in my dissertation, and it would be a real shame if I missed out on it. Yeah, I can do those readings on my own sure, but in the social sciences and humanities, learning in a group can really be helpful. The other is, I'm not doing exceptionally well right now, though functioning. Im doing worse enough that my medication is going to need to be adjusted, and that can be a crapshoot in terms of energy, and even how much time that is being sucked up in terms of running around for blood work and stuff. 

And so, I am e-mailing her to ask her if it would be acceptable for me to audit the course, as well as if I were to take her class if said chapter would be acceptable for the final paper. Going in to the course, I had been planning on writing the piece I am committed for publication this semester for the final paper. But, it does not match up well enough. We had talked about this Thursday, and so I spent the day yesterday and today trying to figure out if I could connect the paper to the course better somehow without jeopardizing or changing it drastically from what I am committed to write about. Then yesterday someone brought up the possibility of auditing when I asked for an opinion.

So I'm kind of e-mailing her to update her to say, ok so I can't fit that original paper into the course, but I have this other one I could write, would it be ok?  And also, as I'm trying to figure out what to do, would auditing -- having access to the readings and coming to class to partake in discussion -- be an option for your course?

And then I am wondering of disclosing my mental health struggles right now to give some context and explanation as to why I'm so concerned about workload this semester. Just telling her, I'm registered with disability student services, here is why. I don't need any accommodation right now, but just so you know where I am coming from as I try and judge energy and workload this semester, because I really don't know how this semester will play out in terms of treatment. And also that I think it is maybe best to just be totally up front and transparent about it.

But, I am also torn if maybe that's a bad thing to do. If it's too much information. I don't think she would discriminate against me by all means, and I think she is a sympathetic person. But still, maybe it isn't the time or situation to tell someone. 

My illness has only really been debilitating enough I've had to register with disability student services for two semesters -- this is the second semester. So it is still kind of new and stressful to navigate that system. And the time crunch to figure out what the hell to do this semester is big -- have to decide by monday.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your insights. I've emailed the professor and heard back from her. I wanted to take care of this quickly, and when I saw janemfraser's advice, it made sense to me, and that's what I did. All (I think) is well in the world. She replied back. It looks like I will audit. ",2,2017-08-27 01:25:35,AskAcademia
4tvgv1,DropOut__Throwaway,t2_zorx2,"18 year old drop out with 4 years of college work littered in F's, W's seeking advice","Hi all, some backstory: I started university in chemistry when I was 14 through a special early entrance program for so-called ""gifted"" students. Long story short, I started out with decent marks  for the first year and a half, then had some family/mental health issues that impeded on my progress and motivation to study. At the beginning of my second semester sophomore year, I was disqualified (kicked out) from the university for having a 0.0 GPA one term (I just stopped going to class and received ""Unauthorized withdrawal""). I hid this from my parents and continued to go the university through their open university program (where non-matriculated students can take classes but pay higher fees). This vicious cycle of dropping classes continued for another 5 semesters, each semester with a 0.0 GPA. I kept convincing myself that this time I'll do better, this time it'll be different, but it of course, that never happened. 

Is my academic career ruined? AFAIK, your academic transcripts follow you around everywhere, and it's impossible to start anew because universities want you to disclose your full academic history (impossible to hide now-a-days with online student clearinghouses).

I've looked into the process of ""academic renewal"" at my university, but it's not what it sounds. You can only do this so called ""renewal"" on courses you took 5 or more years ago. Even if approved, they will only discount 2 consecutive semesters from grade point calculations. To obtain a degree anywhere in the US, one has to have a 2.0 GPA in all college coursework attempted. Right now, my GPA is an abysmal 0.89. 

I enjoyed chemistry a lot, especially my computational chemistry courses. However, it made me realize that I want to switch to computer science instead (I've also been working in the IT field for a year now and would like to progress forward in this area, maybe even transition to academia and get a Masters/PhD)

The problem is, even if I make the switch, I will have to spend up to 2 years full time just just retaking the courses I failed to bring up my campus GPA to a 2.0 or higher since I am not eligible for ""academic renewal"" as per university policy (and most state universities here have similar policies as it's based on a federal law). This whole ordeal of getting a BSCS may take another 5-6 years (I work part-time). It depresses me greatly just to think it about, it seems like I've irrevocably screwed my academic career. It truly honestly looks this way.  I honestly don't know what to do, dwelling on it anymore makes me want to break down and cry. 

Any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated ",2,2016-07-21 05:32:20,AskAcademia

I am considering a major shift in my life/career focus. As an undergraduate, I wanted to pursue a career in psychological research, so naturally I figured a Ph.D was the right move for me. However, I was not accepted out of undergrad (no surprise), and I instead went into a mental health masters program. Having graduated from that, I was struck with the troubling realization that I may not want to be a mental health counselor for the long term. As of right now, I am considering furthering my education in something closer to my original goals. I have learned that I would love to work in higher education, as I did my internship in our university counseling center, and I generally love the atmosphere of higher ed. 

I am thinking about pursuing an education in statistics because it will open up several opportunities for me. I would love to pursue a career in institutional research and advancement, as it would still allow me to do research work while still in a higher ed setting. A local state university is offering an advanced certificate in applied statistical analysis. I am giving this serious consideration. I have also looked at a few online Masters degrees in statistics as well. I would like to avoid an online degree if possible, but I am open to it. 

I have a few questions for the fine folks of this sub. Does anyone have any knowledge of Advanced Certificates for Stats? Is it worthwhile to pursue, and will it help me further my career goals of working in higher ed, or possibly pursuing a Ph.D in the future?

Additionally, would this certificate open doors for me in the working world outside of higher ed? Or would a Master's degree put me in better shape? 

I know I am not in an ideal spot because the Master's degree I have is quite unrelated to the direction I would like to go. Its very unfortunate and I have quite a bit of buyers remorse. However, I am trying to keep looking ahead, and I want to make an informed decision about where to go next. ",2,2016-10-10 17:34:19,AskAcademia

fxwdt5,shesaladymouse,t2_55tb6jgj,"Applying for a PhD after years away from academia, poor mental health","Hi everyone,

I’m new to this sub so please forgive me if this has been discussed before. I have had a search but couldn’t find anything similar.

I’d like to apply for a PhD in History at a UK university. The issue is I’ve completely lost all confidence and connections in academia and have no idea how to go about it. My poor self-esteem is making it really hard for me to take the first steps.

Some background: I achieved distinctions in my BA and MA from two very prestigious universities, but I ended up working in NGOs for the last 10 years since graduation because I got sick of sitting in libraries and wanted to feel I was “making a difference”. I have a couple of topics in mind that link some of the work I’ve been doing with my earlier academic interests, although I haven’t found a professor who is working in this exact area (in the Uk at least).

I’m aware from this subreddit of the pitfalls (regarding career prospects and mental health) of doing a PhD in humanities. That’s for a separate post.

What I’m struggling with is how to reach out and take the first steps. I lost touch with all my professors 10 years ago when I graduated. Despite my grades, I wasn’t a remarkable student in person. I doubt any of them remember me. I feel it’s too awkward coming out of the blue to ask them for references at this point?

Additionally, I feel awkward about approaching new potential supervisors. Why would they bother replying to me unless I have connections or some sort of reputation? Should I have a list of publications at this point that they can look up online? A website or Twitter account? I don’t do social media. I’ve also only found professors whose research interests overlap only partially. 

The final issue is funding. I have seen some funded PhDs on specific topics that I would love to apply for. But again, being out of the loop and not having done my theses on those exact topics, would I stand a chance at all? A lot of work is required just to apply for one of those. Do they usually have MA students already lined up but have to advertise it publicly for legal reasons, or are they usually genuinely interested to hear from different applicants? 

Advice on any of this from a History academic or PhD student would be much appreciated!",2,2020-04-09 17:15:15,AskAcademia
11sr0e,[deleted],,Quitting Question: Play politics or be honesty? ,"Hello all,

I tried to first search this sub-reddit before submitting this question, but I didn't find any similar threads.  

I have decided to leave my program. I am no asking about whether I should or not. I have felt for a while that I am in the wrong department/field. This has led to general anxiety and at least at the moment, I want to leave academia all together (I want to go into NGO work/ or be a FSO). 

My question is how I should go about it. I am a third year PhD in a humanities department. I have yet to take my prelims. I need to do this in order to leave with a Master's so the last few years would not be for naught. Yet this, like all things in graduate school, require faculty interaction. I see two possible routes:

**Playing politics**: this means I would put on a happy face and continue with the motions as if I were staying. The advantage to this is that faculty would probably be more willing to work with me (who wants to help a quitter?). I do not think my adviser would have a problem if I said I wanted out, but other faculty members are needed to complete the prelims (3 to 4). However, he isn't the most detail oriented person and probably doesn't know what the requirements would be for a terminal Master's so I'd have to talk to the director of graduate students anyway, thus stirring the pot--Academia is gossipy. Also, practically speaking, it is never good to leave a job without a secure back up plan. I recognize this, but the downside is I feel this ""posing,"" for lack of a better word, is putting a serious strain on my mental health. I have recently started taking advantages of all the services available on a college campus, including psychological counseling. My therapist has noted my extreme emotional response whenever I talk about my department. It's not that I do not like these people, I just do not feel like I fit in. The classes that I have enjoyed, and the professors with whom I have good relationships with are all outside of the department (my field is interdisciplinary so this is encouraged, however these people cannot be on my prelim committee because that exam reflects your specialized knowledge). 

**Honesty**: This is by far my preferred route. I feel like posing is a waste of time for all parties involved. It has me applying to funding sources for next year that I do not even want and would not be able to use until I pass the prelims anyway. We are funded for 5 years but my ""dissertation"" would require me to travel so more money is needed for the hypothetical project--are you starting to see how this would make someone lose it a bit? . The problem with this is that the requirements for the terminal Master's are not clear as state earlier (this is a PhD program and terminal Master's are for the booted). 

 I assume the work of a terminal master's would just be easier for both me and faculty. I am not lazy but by leaving, there are many other things I have to do in the next semester and a half (apply to jobs/fellowships for Master's Programs etc). 

So what do you think? Keep worrying about egos/departmental politics or secure myself a slice of sanity for the remainder of my time in grad. school?

This came about from looking at how psychology generally has moved from a medical model to a psychological model to understand and treat mental illness.


The idea is that there are qualitative studies looking at how mothers experience perinatal mental illness, and these studies suggest that they understand their problems in terms of psychological issues (adjustment to change, lack of social support) rather than medical problems (hormone changes etc).


However, there aren't many studies looking at what staff think and how staff therefore treat mothers. There are guidelines, which predominantly suggest medicalised interventions with psychological ones to support them. I want to explore what staff think, and whether or not this is in line with what the guidelines recommend.


I want to do this using focus groups of perinatal mental health teams, as I feel capturing the team dynamic will be more useful than capturing individual constructs, as treatment decisions are made in teams. Additionally the teams I have spoken to would prefer to do focus groups than individual interviews.


I've looked at using critical discourse analysis, thematic analysis, frame analysis and repertory grids.


I feel critical discourse analysis is too language-focused and the idea of a 'social problem' does not fit well.


I'm not sure if I can use repertory grids to study teams.


I've not been able to find much literature around frame analysis, although it looks very suitable!


Thematic analysis appears overly simplistic for my aims, and I can't currently justify using it unless I have a solid rationale for rejecting alternative methodologies.

I fear failure, and letting down my advisor. I feel like all my interest in my project has washed away. I have fantasies about quitting my MS and abandoning my field altogether to work in something completely different. The main reasons for me not wanting to quit are that I fear that it will kill my career before it starts, and I would be so ashamed and embarrassed. I also feel guilty because I'm being paid off a grant, and if I quit, I don't know what that will mean for my advisor and the timing/requirements of the grant.

\*(my husband knows it is a common practise for some other fields to do this at our University)

There is an elaborated description of past events below. Here is the TLDR: I was a workaholic in the past (consistently says 60-80h weeks of work and loving it), and now I struggle to put in even 4 hours of work a week. I had more then a few health issues which are mostly resolved now and mental health troubles which were not adequately resolved and I am seeking help for (but this takes time). I have ""started"" my PhD a total of 7 times between my first year and this moment (start 4th and last year) and then had to stop working. I no longer want to be an academic and I do not need a PhD.

Not getting a PhD means:- not having a PhD;- visum headaches/job hunting headaches/learning new skills;- having to explain a 3 year gap in my CV;- failing the people who supported me (my parents, my professors, my husband);- more emotional turmoil to work through- possibly having to pay back a subsidy of 15 000 eur I was given for housing (used to help my parents)

Even with all these downsides, I can't bring myself to focus on my work and do what I am supposed to do. I don't know what is wrong with me, or how to fix it.

*Past events in more details:*

Before my PhD I was top of my class, always working on research, outreach, internships, mentoring, tutoring, science camps... you get the picture. I had always been tough/resilient (raised by single mom, started helping with the bills very young, taking care of myself and then the both of us...). At the start of my PhD I was transitioning from theory/simulations to observations (in astro). I had a postdoc (lets call him *Dave*) as my go-to supervisor. I also have an official mentor (lets call him *Mark*) who is a full-professor. Mark was supportive until a year ago, then he lost faith in me -- and I can't blame him. Dave was toxic to me and starting my PhD with him seriously hurt me mentally. They made me feel incompetent and unintelligent, and since they had a good relationship with other members of the institute my complaints went ignored.

The start of my PhD was not a good time for me - death in the family, housing issues for my parents who live 2000km away, suddenly getting dumped by fiancé of 7 years, harrasment by one of the other PhD students, breaking an arm, physical therapy, and not much help with psychologial therapy.

At the start of my 2nd year I was determined to turn things around. I was actively looking for/asking for a therapist for my work anxieties. I started to build up my confidence bit by bit, started dating, met a great man (who is now my husband, and without whom I could not have gotten through any of this...). I got assigned a new postdoc (lets call her *Amy*). Amy is great, but I feel like I have let her down so many times.

Just a short month after I was making some progress I had a horrible accident - I broke my spine. I had to be bed ridden for 4 months and after that I had so much therapy. I tried coming back to work several times only to be forced to do more therapy due to horrible pain. All this time, I am feeling worse and worse. I had a total of 10 sessions with a therapist, and that helped temporarily, but I am still feeling stuck.

In the 3rd year it was discovered that I had a huge ovarian cyst, and the whole next year was a cycle of fear and pain for me. Not knowing if I will have to get it removed, not knowing if I will be able to have a child (which I had always wanted to). I got another therapist who would take me - they couldn't speak English very well and that was a limiting factor. She let me go after getting better for a bit, and I didn't know who to turn to after getting worse again. My cyst finally stabilised and shrunk this summer, and Mark told me point blank that I had to get going with my PhD if I want to finish it.

And I tried, and I failed to work. I know doing science isn't smooth sailing, but at the moment it feels like doing 1h of work consumes all my available energy. Even running my code and ending up with a bug makes me burst into tears and have an onslaught of negative thoughts/emotions. Back in September there was an online conference, I had to have my camera off for most of it, as I was just crying most of the time, and angry the rest of the time (somehow that is one lvl below crying, I don't know).

I don't know how to make this PhD a success story. Looking back, I can clearly see places where I should have acted differently and I know I can't change it, but I also don't know how to move forward, and how to make sure that I don't get into the same situation again where I get a good job and then ruin it for myself.

dso1rz,blackberry_bonnet,t2_36y0p2e1,Falling behind in classes because of brain fog; can't explain or treat it -- how do I handle this?,"Hi, 

In the beginning of this semester, I was doing great and getting A's on my exams. I love all my classes and wanted/want to go to graduate school. When I thought I might have to drop a class, I literally cried (and ended up keeping it). 

But over the past few weeks I've had a problem with brain fog and fatigue that's only gotten worse and worse. I have a long-term undiagnosed illness (already seen lots of doctors, tried lots of stuff and registered with the disability office), but because of being undiagnosed, I don't know if the brain fog is from that or from something else like mental health or stress or burnout. It may be inflammation related, but my doctors cannot know anything for sure.

But for the past week, I have slept and slept, struggled to get out of bed, missed classes. Even just sitting up at a desk with books is a huge effort, and even when I manage to force myself to ""study"", my brain somehow does not have the power to read more than a few pages or retain information. Because of this, I have already completely screwed up a midterm (after acing the first one), missed two homework assignments, and am missing an opportunity to re-write a paper (deadline in a few days). I am far behind in 2/3 classes. I could probably still catch up, but the thing is my body won't cooperate. I want to catch up more than anything and do better, but it's 4:00p and I'm falling asleep, and when I sit down with books I still don't get anything done. 

I've tried everything I have access to -- unholy amounts of caffeine, B12 and vitamins and energy supplements, handfuls of anti-inflammatories, more sleep and less sleep, pomodoro timers, blocking websites, but nothing seems to help the fatigue and brain fog. 

It is really distressing and upsetting to be falling behind and doing poorly in classes that are vital for my major. I'm afraid I could lose my shot at graduate school. And most of all, I have no idea what to do. I don't even know if I can get an extension on my current assignments because I've already gotten several (via the disability center for more medical issues). Even if I do, how can I do the work better in a few days than I can today (answer: I probably can't)? Is there anything I'm missing? What should I be doing right now? 

I think I need to meet with professors, but what exactly can I tell them? What should I even be asking for?

 I'm already an older undergraduate so I DON'T want to withdraw or take time off, and besides there's no guarantee this will ever change. Usually I have 'bad weeks' and 'good weeks' so hopefully this will improve soon, but there's no way to know.",2,2019-11-06 22:45:54,AskAcademia

Last minute, I was also told I needed to find one more committee member (I’d previously been told I only needed two). During my first meeting with my entire committee with this new member, I’m suddenly told that this paper is not adequate for applications in this field of study due to the subject matter, and I’m told to begin writing a new proposal and outline. This new member is not my main advisor, and my main advisor had never indicated that my subject would be problematic in the past. In this very meeting, my main advisor and other committee member went from saying my sample was ready to agreeing that I should write about something different for my applications. (To be clear there isn’t anything particularly offensive in my sample. It doesn’t assert anything racist, sexist, or controversial).

I put a lot of time and effort into this project.. Many of my applications are due in a couple of weeks, so I’d been advised to removed a lot of schools from my list. This limits me to masters programs, which is okay I guess, because my goal was to actually complete a masters before a PhD, but I’d put off my physical and mental health hoping that I’d have my applications submitted by November.

I have a pretty strong GPA, GRE scores, research experience, and a strong background in the languages necessary for my program. Everything has been in order except for this writing sample. 

At present I feel sort of hopeless. There are only 4 professors in my department, so I depend on all three of their letters. This means I’m not really in a position to disagree with their plan of action. 

So much work has gone into this thesis.. my advisor had even voiced that he’d been treating in the same nature as he does masters theses... at present it feels as though that work has gone down the drain.. I feel like I’ll never reach the light at the end of the tunnel... 

Has anyone gone through anything similar, and if so how did you cope? How did you get passed it and persevere? If anyone has advice I’d appreciate it.

My original advisor left at the end of end of last year; a new professor in a slightly different subfield took me on, but we could never find a middle ground with questions that interested us both.

This week I am meeting with one more professor, to see if they are willing to take me on. But a) they are very skeptical, and b) I didn't have a great experience TAing for them, because of some mental health issues.

The reason they are skeptical is because I've never gone out of my way to express interest in their subfield. I'm extremely interested in it, but had felt like just switching would be giving up on my current line of research. My plan had always been to branch out into it when things were solidified with my primary advisor, but obviously things never got to that point.

I've been in therapy for the mental health issues, and have been making really good progress. The advisor who just dropped me said he's even seen some improvement in my work (which was a result of overcoming some of the health issues).

What can I do during this meeting to get my best shot at convincing them to take me on, even on a trial basis? I know the odds are stacked against me, but I think this is my last option before being booted out of the program.",2,2019-05-27 19:29:09,AskAcademia

Thank you for reading this, I feel really helpless and it really does mean a lot to me.

I feel really alone in all of this. I’m posting here in hopes to get advice with writing the appeal, as well as how to cope with the pain and everything in my life right now. I have ADHD, depression, and borderline personality disorder.

I just finished my freshman year of college in a relatively competitive pharmacy program. I truly am passionate about pursuing this career, especially after being more exposed to it despite my failure to do well academically. My ADHD and depression have hindered me from performing to the best of my ability academically. 

SHORTENED SUMMARY OF MY SITUATION:


- entered college with no therapy or psychiatrist
- depressed, anxious, difficulty adjusting, extremely toxic relationship, lost friends, academic probation first semester
- beginning of second semester was suicidal and was almost hospitalized. have since been getting therapy and psychiatric help
- ADHD diagnosed only in the middle of second semester, adderall prescribed and changed my life
- saw improvements in all aspects of my life
- 30 to 40 point improvement in midterm grades (there are several)
- reconciled lost friendships, clean room, some improvement 
- ADHD diagnosis leading to improvement  middle of second semester could not ignore the fact I did terrible previously
- 2 weeks before finals, prescribed medication for depression. made me anxious and had many panic attacks. did terrible on finals. frustrating bc I felt myself getting better. instantly stopped medication and feel better 
- stopped going to therapy for three weeks because can’t seem to connect. have a plan to go to DBT
- have made new study plans and methods, taking summer courses for failed classes where I can use and practice them to prepare me for fall
- will my university understand? prepared 2.5 pages for the appeal, academic advisor said length is fine. if you read details below, what do i include or omit? Is there hope?

DETAILS (if you wanna read pls do but it’s cool)

I managed to do well in high school after going to therapy for my depression, raising my grades and test scores. I stopped therapy before my senior year due to insurance reasons, mistakenly thinking that I was better, and cultural differences with my parents (asian). Stopping it was a mistake. 

I entered my freshman year of college enthusiastic. Not seeing a therapist and dealing with my at the time undiagnosed ADHD became key factors to my academic degradation. I had trouble adjusting to the new lifestyle, my already disorganized nature became 10x worse, and had trouble maintaining my basic humans needs. I ended my first semester on academic probation with a 2.2 gpa. It devastated me but I failed to express this to my friends and parents, something I regret. I kept telling myself that I will do better next semester, that it was my fault.

Within the first few weeks of second semester, I was truly at my lowest point. In addition to academic probation, I was also in an extremely toxic relationship that I wish I got out of sooner, but struggled to because of my mental illnesses. I would tend to hyperfocus on making it better, when really I should have been focusing on myself and my academics. Staying with this person made me feel full and euphoric when it was good, but wore me down as a human being to the point where my sense of identity even today is down the drain. I had no friends and found myself crying everyday in my dorm. My close friends left me. I stopped going to classes. I was disorganized and messy in every aspect of my life. My self esteem was practically non-existent. My parents were never ones to understand my mental health due to cultural differences, so I didn’t even open up to them.

One day within those first few weeks of the second semester, I was extremely suicidal in my dorm and vented to my RA who called the police. I will forever be grateful for this person because he is the reason I am now getting the treatment and help that I needed. I was almost hospitalized  (I got out of because I wanted to go to my classes) and have since then been receiving help. 

Ever since that night, I have been going to therapy and a psychiatrist. The biggest thing that helped me was my ADHD diagnosis and the adderall I started taking for it. It not only helped me academically, but in every other aspect of my life. My parents were very against medication my whole life. Only when it got to the point where I was about to be hospitalized did they agree to let me take medication and they were very supportive in me getting better.

I only started taking the adderall in the beginning of march. I saw 30-40 point improvement in my midterm grades. I lost many friendships but was able to rebuild them. I was able to keep a clean room, which means so much to me even if it doesn’t for the average person. However, it still was not a drastic fix. I had bad days still which was expected. 

My improvement in my midterm grades could not erase the fact that I did poorly first semester. It did not erase my terrible midterm grades (there are several midterms) during the beginning of second semester, which were failing. My improvements did not take into account my failures prior to my ADHD diagnosis.

I tried and tried to build my relationship with my therapist but it didn’t work out. My improvement there was minimal. I ended up cancelling appointments near the end of april.  My psychiatrist has helped me so much and understands me. She has even directed me to a better therapy, a DBT program that is near my college. I plan on making an appointment on monday and to tell my current therapist that I cannot see her again. 

Two weeks before finals week, I began a new medication for depression. It caused me to have extreme anxiety during finals. I did not study effectively and had panic attacks everyday. As a result, I did terribly on my finals. I got a C+ in a well known GPA booster class because I did bad on the final, when doing well could have lead me to a B+ in the class. I immediately stopped the medication and feel a lot better now. I know that if I did well on my finals, which was realistic after calculating my grades (were attainable grades), I would not been dismissed because I calculated the outcomes of my GPA beforehand.

QUESTIONS AND NEED FOR HELP:

I don’t know if my university will understand this. I feel really alone and haven’t told my friends. Most of my friends are in the pharmacy program too. A lot of my whole social life (the people I see and interact with on a daily basis) is based off pharmacy. A lot of my life in general has been based off me being in this program. I cannot help but feel shame. I hold myself accountable for everything, for I should have reached for help sooner.

I am currently registered for two classes that I failed. My summer course starts this tuesday. Never have I been so determined to do well in these. I have cut off my toxic relationship too and have planned out my days hour by hour. I have planned to go to office hours and extra help this summer. Taking these courses will help me utilize my new planned studying methods so that I can be prepared for the fall, that is if they accept my appeal.

Will my university understand my situation? What in the letter should I stressed about my situation, or do I just go into as much detail as I did above? What do I not mention? What will make my case the most convincing that I can do better? I have prepared 2 1/2 pages for the appeal including steps for the future and the pharmacy academic advisor told me that is a good amount. I only have a limited amount of time and have already gotten most of my documentation to prove myself to my school. How do I deal with this dread? Is there hope?

Thank you for reading this if you did. I appreciate it a lot and hope you are all doing well.",2,2019-05-26 08:32:14,AskAcademia

Finished a masters in Pharmacology/Neuroscience in the spring. Work included running animal trials, experiments, brain splicing, minimal amount of electrophysiology, etc. I was independent, in the lab by myself every day and loved it. 

Started Phd this September with the same prof. Have been doing purely electrophysiology since then and can't stand it. I have my project all designed and ready to go, but instead I am being used as an employee per say, doing electrophysiology for an irrelevant experiment. I have no say on what I do, and this is not contributing my to project at all. Despite meetings and discussions with my prof about how this is not the direction I was promised and is wasting my time, it appears this stuff can't be wrapped up until march. Which is nearly 8 months of a 4ish years Phd doing something that is not relevant to my project.

I hate going in to work everyday, my mental health is down the toilet, it is affecting my relationship and time at home, I don't feel like this is what a PhD is supposed to be, and I have seriously considered quitting. I have 2 years of funding until Summer 2021 (scholarship = $1800/month) but my Phd should be complete in 2023 so I am not fully covered. As per terms of my scholarship, my prof was supposed to fund a 3rd year (2021-2022) but he has already said he doesn't have the money for it. 

This week I was asked by a member of my committee to help mark some papers for a small class. Turns out to be 24students x16page term papers that have to be all marked by this Friday. All to be completed on my own time in the evenings. Should I have said no? 

I have heard of people switching labs mid way through a graduate degree. I don't know if this would be a good option or if it is better to stay put, or if it is better to try and switch labs early on (4 months into my degree) as opposed to later on. I would be limited to the same university due to family circumstances. I don't even know how to go about switching labs.

Side note from the actual poster: I don't believe this Phd student is advocating for himself enough when meeting with the prof. Quitting, switching labs, poor mental health, hating work life has never been discussed with the prof, but rather what has been discussed is the frustration with not starting his own project yet and the dislike for electrophysiology and lack of independence.",2,2019-12-10 19:42:39,AskAcademia

Advice on personal statements for graduate applications.,"I am applying to experimental research programs in the field of psychology (cognitive). The following wall of text provides background on the point I would like to get across to potential mentors, but I have heard from some people that disclosing information on past mental health issues could backfire. I understand their point of view on this but I am personally very proud of my perseverance and I feel that without my previous struggles would not have found a passion for this field of study.  

I have heard several opinions from grad students to professors, mostly varying. I was hoping for some insight from you all! 

Thanks in advance!

I will be graduating this May with a &gt;3.0 but still not a GPA that I am ecstatic about. I will have time to study for the GRE before taking it but I feel that my personal statement paper can be a great selling point for me. At the beginning of my undergraduate career I had a rather difficult time adjusting. Growing up my mother and I struggled with cultural differences (she was born and raised in Beijing), this unfortunately fostered a rather problematic relationship between the two of us. Once I graduated high school my family moved to a different state and I chose to stay behind on my own. Prior to graduating high school I struggled with some mental health difficulties, these struggles followed me into college, which reflected in my grades during my first semester at a university. I made the mistake of not using any of my drops and instead failed out of some classes (dumb, I know). I was eventually placed on academic suspension and decided to take time off from school to try to get my life together outside of college. I sought out therapy on my own, completed it, and slowly got myself back into college courses. I changed my major from art to psychology and ever since have made great strides to success. After getting my suspension repealed I took my GPA from a 1.2 to graduating with higher than a 3.0. I mostly maintained A's throughout the rest of my studies and have really found a field that I feel I can eventually contribute to in the future. I am wanting to pursue research in the field of cognitive psychology. I have been actively involved in labs with professors and graduate students, have a publication under my belt, and am working on more publications in the near future. I know that often times people in the field of psychology are drawn to the field because of personal struggles of their own. Although this is true for me, I do not wish to pursue counseling. Instead I would like to continue growing in the field of research because I really believe that expressing myself in this fashion has allowed me to become a healthier and better self.

The classes are not hard, they’re challenging since I was in the pre-health track, but I enjoyed them. It wouldn’t make sense to finish out the semester, because I was only signed up for classes that would fulfill my major, a major that I am not entirely sure I am interested in. I am currently 20 years old, and took a gap year to Japan so I was considered “non-traditional” by my school. I have been away from my family twice before (I was also an exchange student in Germany for 1 year when I was 15, same program) and lived independently, so I know that is not the issue. This past summer before enrolling, I had no intention of going to a four year university until the spring, so I could work and get my mental health in check. Then, I visited the school I am currently enrolled at, and everything seemed good on paper, so I enrolled last minute. I have been battling with my anxiety and eating disorder really badly, and the free health and counseling services at my school have been working really slow. I recently had a panic attack and called my mom crying saying I was driving home that evening (I live three hours away). My family wanted me to go to community college originally to save $$, but I was resistant because that wasn’t the path my friends were taking, and I wanted the “college experience.” Well, at the school I am going to it’s practically non-existent. While I love the big city, there is a “every man for himself” mentality. This might just be the transition to adulthood...but I am seriously just not ready for it. I want to be with my family, and make a slow transition. In addition to that, I had a job lined up before I left and now I cannot even find a job where I am living in college. I thought the “college experience” and the “quality” professors and the big city life would all make up for the debt I will have accumulated but now I am freaking out because I had that panic attack, I am weary about my major, the school I am at feels like a commuter school (except without any sense of community)....and all the reasons mentioned above.

biwmuj,3pt1415926,t2_3naa04bw,"Considering Mastering Out Due to Multiple Reasons, Looking for Similar Experiences","Hello everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I am working towards a PhD in a STEM field at a public university. For the past few months, I've had doubts about whether it is still worth it for me to continue to work towards this. I know I have imposter syndrome, as well as other mental health issues, such as anxiety, perfectionism, FOMO, and maybe more. Let me give you some background.

&amp;#x200B;

I attended undergrad at the same school I'm attending now. I have been in graduate school for 3 years, and I am due to take my comprehensive exams in the summer. My first year of grad school, I entered as a Master's student, with hopes of finishing that degree, working for a bit and maybe coming back to do a PhD. In the spring of that year, my adviser suggested that I switch to a PhD instead. He clearly saw something in me, and also stated that it would be smart to do it now, since it would be more work down the road if I wanted to get my PhD later. I agreed and decided to do it. Fast forward two years, and now I have no desire to attend class, have not published one paper yet, and am still unsure of what I actually want to do research in.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to note that my adviser is a ""scatter-brain"" of sorts, and it seems that he gets distracted easily when I suggest something new I'd like to look into. This has resulted in a paper I worked on for over a year that hasn't been touched in about 3 or 4 months, because he hasn't looked it over like he said he would.

&amp;#x200B;

I would also like to note that I am seeing a therapist, since the beginning of this year.

&amp;#x200B;

I've sort of made a personal decision to not do anything drastic until after I take my exams, but I'm losing focus on the now over this and finding it difficult to study, do work, and attend class. I recently reached out to one of my professors about the issues I've been having, as well as an issue with not being interested overall in the course they were teaching. They said they understand (to put it simply), and are happy to talk over a drink about their experience and why a PhD was right for them.

&amp;#x200B;

I've researched jobs and it seems that for the type of person that I am (I like having instructions on how to do things and then doing them, I don't like making decisions however I do like adding my two cents about things), and it seems like a Master's may be the better choice for me. But it would also feel so great to finish and beat that dissertation and get the doctorate.

&amp;#x200B;

So at this point, I feel like I have no one to get advice from regarding this. Everyone I know either has a PhD or is working towards one, and I just wish I could have some insight from those who decided it wasn't for them and how things turned out. (Note, I don't feel comfortable asking my peers, at least not yet).

&amp;#x200B;

I would appreciate any insight that anyone has. These past few months have been really difficult on me mentally, and I feel like I'm at a breaking point. Thanks.

c2khgb,RainWolfheart,t2_o9dvb,"Theatre undergrad conflicted about what to do next, need advice","I've got 2.5 semesters left with my BA in Theatre with minor in Women's Studies at the University of Ottawa. It has come to my attention that what I was originally envisioning—picking up next September at the same school with a two-year MA, taking a few years to do some studying/work abroad or elsewhere in Canada, then returning to Ottawa permanently to get my PhD and teach—isn't realistic, because most people are expected to work in places they didn't study at. I hadn't realized that, but it makes sense.

This is a really big conflict for me, because I finally thought I had found a career path, but I don't know if I can achieve it in a way that will make me happy. I have a lot of personal reasons to want to stay here:

* Even if I study and publish primarily in one language (English or French), I want to work in a bilingual environment, and Ottawa is kind of the only place where I can do that, in theatre. That's why I came here in the first place.
* This city genuinely feels like home, more than any other place I've lived. I've got some great friends who are settled here, it's close but not too close to my family, and I'm finally starting to feel like part of a community (beyond just theatre/university).
* The first couple years of my BA were rough. I was really depressed and in an unhealthy relationship. It's only in the past year that I've gotten my shit together (turns out I have ADHD!), and I'm *genuinely terrified* of losing all the confidence and relationships I've built up by moving to a new city. Making friends as an adult is hard.

I see the merits of studying elsewhere. But I don't want to embark on that if it means I'll never be able to come home. But, then, if I'm ultimately not going to end up here anyway, I want spend a few more years before moving on. The way I see it, my options are:

* Do my MA abroad, spend some time working, then try to get into a PhD program in Ottawa with that outside experience. This would probably be the best career choice, but put kind of everything else about my life (friendships, family, mental health) in a more precarious position in the short-term.
* Do my MA in Ottawa, and figure out what to do for a PhD program, knowing I can't stay in Ottawa. This feels like the best option in the short-term, but is really scary long-term, because I don't really want to end up living permanently in Winnipeg or whatever just because that's the only place that would take me. Also, if I do my MA in Ottawa, my program is almost entirely paid for by scholarships, which is a huge perk I'm not guaranteed elsewhere.
* Give up on my dreams of doing research and get qualified to teach high school instead. AKA, giving up, but this would probably be a safe choice.

Everyone around me (TAs, theatre profs, director of graduate studies) seems to be encouraging me to do my MA here, but that seems to contradict what other people say (profs in other departments, articles I've read), and the career paths of most of my professors. They're probably the best people to be asking, but that will have to wait until the fall.

Basically, I'd really like some advice from people who have been in similar situations and/or theatre academics who have advice specific to this field. Am I missing something obvious? What is realistic?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I really love the city where I'm doing my BA in Theatre and I'm scared of losing everything I've found here by doing my MA elsewhere; but if I stay here, then I probably won't be able to stay for my PhD, too, and I can't decide which is better given my career goals and mental health situation.

byy2ir,akapine006,t2_2yr73017,[Seeking Advice] Health problems getting in the way of making an important deadline,"Hi all- looking for a second opinion here in terms of how I should approach this subject matter with my supervisors.

To keep things short, for the past 3 weeks I've been suffering from on and off vertigo-like (?) symptoms which I initially attributed to my low blood pressure. This includes: loss of balance, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, inability to focus (sight &amp; mental thoughts), temporary black outs, etc. It's not severe enough that I've gone to the ER/hospital for it, but it's made me bedridden for a while. Some days I'd be perfectly fine and functional, but some other days I even physically get up. On bad days I try to keep up with menial/less cognitive-demanding tasks, but it's been aggressive enough that my paper writing process has ground to a halt.

As of now we're looking at a mid-July deadline to publish a review that I've been working on in a special issue. I haven't completely lost hope, but my secondary supervisor (Postdoc) has recently really been pushing that I send her anything that I might have on the manuscript so that she can have a look, which I am not completely ready for. My main supervisor (Prof) has been very supportive and not really demanded any text from me, but I still feel quite guilty for not being able to be more productive.

All in all, I am just trying to get over this feeling of helplessness and guilt for not meeting my supervisors' expectations. Additionally, I'd appreciate any advice on how I should communicate with them. They know that I am ill, and that I am trying to get better (hoping to see a neurologist soon), but it seems I have not communicated to them well enough that my illness is severe enough that I might not meet the deadline.

I am about to appeal my degree classification and just wanted some unbiased advice, please. 

Throughout my final year of university I’ve had increasing mental health issues (depression &amp; anxiety) which were diagnosed 7 years ago and known to my university, I had a meeting and they gave me a generic “Summary if Adjustments”. There’s a fairly extensive paper trail (emails) of me requesting support, attending meetings, the university acknowledging my circumstances and agreeing to support me. 

I applied to have counselling at the university which was 6 sessions starting at the end of September 2018. These 6 sessions didn’t have a major impact on my situation but they definitely helped. I was in contact with the student welfare officer regularly who helped me in applying for deferrals for 2/3 modules that were due in December 2018 as the counselling sessions ended in early December. By this point I was still struggling but even more so as I found out my grandma was not well, who I am close to. Both the councillors and the welfare officer advised me to go back on antidepressants, I was off because my GP at home always has someone new working there (I assume it’s a training place) and explaining my situation to a new person every time is stressful and it’s not easy with anxiety. 

The welfare officer told me to use the student medical centre, so I signed up, spoke to someone and they prescribed me half my original dosage of Citalopram (from 40mg to 20mg) in January. This antidepressant takes 4 weeks to start having an effect. Just before receiving this my grandma passed away, followed by my aunt a few weeks later and my grandad almost exactly a year before my grandma (my last grandparents). 

I arranged a meeting with the welfare officer again and told her my mental health is deteriorating and how I’ve lost my grandparents, I also told her how I’m having family issues as another family member was lying, withholding information and pushing for an autopsy on my grandma which delayed laying her to rest, this was culturally wrong and was hitting my mum extremely hard, so I moved back home for a few days to support her. The welfare officer emailed the counselling service at the uni and asked for me to have urgent sessions because of my situation. 

I was offered a group mental health workshop a month~ later, which I could not attend but asked to join the next one and was told I would be informed, as that was when my grandmas funeral service and cremation were happening and I moved home for that. This other family member decided to cut my mum out of all communication because they wanted more support but my mum works and they do not. When it came to the viewing of my grandma, we were told by a different family member a time and a place. We go there and the  family member who has been causing all this mess put a password on viewing my grandma and wouldn’t tell us. My mum complained and we got to say goodbye. 

Sorry if this is too much detail or sounds like a sob story but I’m just trying to get my point across. 

I moved back to university and continued with the semesters work but extremely struggling. I contacted the welfare officer again saying I’m seriously struggling to do normal things like eat, socialise, attend lectures and concentrate and that I had not heard back about counselling sessions but just received a generic response of maybe deferring or extending my modules for this semester. I asked whether my circumstances could be taken into consideration when marking my assignments and she said the university doesn’t do that. 

So I go and get extensions on my modules for this semester. This wasn’t a good idea, without much support it was just extra time for me to struggle with. 

I received my results for the modules I deferred in December and had a mean of 64.67% for my first semester a mid 2:1.

In May I was called by the counselling service and was offered sessions, 3 months after requesting them and that’s 3 months of not much support from the university other than maybe extend or defer, dealing with my family issues and my own mental health - lonely times. 
I had moved back home shortly before this as I was not receiving support and thought being home would help, so I couldn’t accept the sessions but also this was after lectures had ended and it was just deadlines. 

My second semester modules came back as a mean of 53% a low 2:2, 11.67% less than the previous semester where I received counselling and support. 

After seeing this I checked the university policy and it states that if a student has circumstances which affect their academic performance, it could be requested to be considered during marking of assignments, with potentially a different marking system in place. Whereas the welfare officer said the university doesn’t do this. 

It states that appeals can be made if academic performance has been affected by circumstances of the student that are unknown to the marker and results are lower than expected. 

My overall is 57.8%, 2.2% away from a 2:1 classification. On the grounds of my circumstances, the lack of support (apart from extension/deferral, which would/did not help alone) and the misinformation of the policy above - Is it fair for me to appeal to have my degree classification reconsidered from a 2:2 to a 2:1?

I have the full paper trail and evidence but a friend had told me he doesn’t think this is enough for them to even consider it. 

Any help or advice would be much appreciated. 

Thank you. 

Tl:dr - deteriorating mental health, family members passing and a lack of support bar extension/deferral caused a significant drop in results to just miss the upper classification by 2.2%, do I have a case for an appeal?",2,2019-06-08 09:06:03,AskAcademia
dbto1u,walkaflackalame,t2_4b2mwnxi,Advise on withdrawing from MS program 1 month in?,"Hi everyone! As you can gather from the title I am considering leaving my MS program which I started just 4 weeks ago. However, I’m really struggling to make a decision as there are a lot of factors feeding into my situation. 
A little context: I went straight from my undergraduate school (finished in August) to a rigorous dual degree MS program at an elite school. It was my dream all through undergraduate, and I worked my a** off to get to this position. It’s a well acclaimed school and program, I am a part of a fantastic cohort, my advisor is wonderful, and I’ve received a decent scholarship (although I am still taking on a lot of debt....another reason I am hesitant...but more on that later). 

I’ve also struggled with my mental health all through my schooling, which peaked this time last year. I actually decided to break between undergrad/grad but was swayed from my advisor, the scholarship, not having a better immediate option, internal expectations and ideas of “success”

Since I have arrived here I have been miserable. I cannot focus on my classes and am crying almost everyday. The coursework is very challenging and I do not have any motivation. Additionally, I question whether this is what I even want to study/ if this is the right step for me / if I even WANT to be in graduate school right now. These existential thoughts have just build upon my anxiety and depression and I have not been in such a dark place in a very long time. 

So I’m thinking I need to withdraw for my mental health and to also figure out what it is exactly I want to do in life. I feel like I rushed into a program without really weighing all my options and now I’m feeling like I’ve made a huge mistake being here. However, I’m also aware that this is a very good opportunity and this degree will give me more opportunities in the future. But I’m just so miserable I am hardly working in my classes. I’m thinking I want to do some part time or entry level work or something in the service sect but I’m worried that my anxiety is just going to follow me there— I am not sure. Part of me feels that my anxiety really stems from academia and that pressure and im just incredibly burnt out, but I also wonder if it will just follow me when I quit...

Any advise or thoughts are welcome. Sorry if this is so disorganized I am incredibly flustered.",2,2019-10-01 13:50:02,AskAcademia

Basically, I am exactly one year into my studies and I am really not having a good time. I have been working on a project which isn't giving me any positive or interesting results, and I am not really enjoying the day to day work like I thought I would. I have also undergone some really big mental health stresses whilst on the PhD programme, and am now on a dose of anti depressents for anxiety and general low mood. I came straight to my course from Bsc, without a masters in between, and over this year I have pretty much come to the conclusion that research is not for me. I am very bad at quitting things, but this is clearly effecting my health through stress and I don't know if it is worth it anymore.

My upgrade is in April, and I a) don't think I have enough novel data to pass and b) I don't know if I can face another 2.5 years of this anyway. I was wondering if anyone had any experience of asking the university themselves to be put on the masters programme, or to be mastered out. I can probably write up some sort of thesis full of negative results, and reviewing the relevant literature, but I don't think I want to take this any further. 

I also don't want to seem ungrateful to people that have helped me, or invested funds in me, but I don't really see another way forward other than just leaving outright now. How should I go about discussing this with my supervisor, who is by all means nice but very professional- there isn't really a strong personal relationship between us.

&amp;#x200B;

He did his PhD research in liver cancer, and is now at a very well-known cancer research institute as a postdoc. He's only been there a year and a half, but hasn't made any strides in his research. His PI is largely ""checked out"" of the lab, as she travels for conferences etc for most of the year, and is past the traditional retirement age. Despite attempts to form relationships with peers, they are mostly nose to the grindstone and relatively anti-social. His PI during his PhD was also a nightmare, extremely unhelpful and unsupportive, sort of just skating by on tenure.

Long story short, there are plenty of industry/biotech companies in the area. He has no interest in climbing the academia ladder. He just wants to do science and not ""take his work home"" with him. He's willing to put in the work (he currently spends 60+ hours in his lab, 7 days a week). As a scientist myself, I firmly believe he's just had a long stroke of bad luck, and needs to change his environment completely. I think pivoting outside of his niche/comfort zone to learn new assays, techniques, and areas of research would be a welcome change. I think he needs to make himself more competitive since the job field is so immunology-heavy, and he's more molecular-focused. 

&amp;#x200B;

My main question is how to frame this positively in a cover letter, or in interviews. He's apprehensive about the process because he doesn't want to come off as a ""failure"". Any tips, key phrases, or helpful advice you can offer is super appreciated.

d3v98v,pi-corna,t2_39zx4ods,Should i trust my gut about potential supervisor? [TL;DR at the end],"Hi everyone, I am a [M.Sc](https://M.Sc) student and I am currently reconsidering the choice of the prof who will have to follow me for my thesis and I need some advice because I currently don't know what to do. Thanks in advance.

The story (rant) needs a bit of introduction. I will post a TL;DR at the end soooo don't worry guys I won't waste much of your time.

In my country my degree ([M.Sc](https://M.Sc) in Molecular Biology) consists of one year of lectures and a one year internship (inside or outside the university) that ends with a thesis defense, and that's great, yeah, cool. I was very struck by a subject in particular and decided that I wanted to do the internship in the professor's laboratory that held two classes in my degree course. The one on the first semester is mandatory while the one on the 2nd semester is optional, but I wanted really bad to be in that lab and the best idea was to follow the optional course (btw, it was interesting and easy so it didn't bother me at all).

This particular professor has a really nice and well-funded lab, publish on good journals and several people work there.

I talked to him at the end of the lectures (1st semester) and he seemed enthusiastic about my interest in the subject, yeah, cool, maybe my dream-lab wants me to join. When I took the written exam I was, according to him, the best of the exam session and then I passed the oral exam. I somewhat had a bad feeling about that professor's behavior, but I couldn't rationalize it so I went over it, maybe I was just irrationally paranoid.

I took the second course that was more practical because it would provide me with useful knowledge for the internship and it seemed that it was a matter of time, at the end of the class they literally ASKED me if I would join them this October (remember this for later) to work on a little-explored field of the subject, super cool, fuck yeah. So I took the optional exam and waited for the results.

I scored 93.33% at the exam, I did obviously good and I wasn't worried at all.

When i came in his office to see what I did wrong he told me that he gave me that score because I made a distraction-driven error on writing serial dilutions. No practical/conceptual error, it wasn't even a miscalculation, it was clearly a single oversight that propagated and invalidated the answer, and he also agreed with me on that. The fact is that he told me that he was worried that i could screw something serious in the lab because if i made that SINGLE idiotic oversight I might oversee other important things in the real lab practice, he told me that in case I could do a one-month trial in his lab and that if I oversee something he would basically cut me off, the worst thing is that he told me that maybe I won't be able to start in October but in March (because he's waiting for an other Master student to graduate) and it pissed me off because you can't tell me something so important if you are not sure you can keep the promise, considering that starting the internship late means graduating late and paying more university fees and I'm not rolling in dough.

His behaviour started to bugger me, A LOT. He gave me the impression that he doesn't care at all about my intellectual ability, he did not say a word about the fact that I used informations outside the program to answer an open question in a creative way (but with a sense); all he cared about was that idiotic mistake. More than anything else, it seems that I shouldn't make mistakes instead of learning from them.

I think I'm worth much more than the professor thinks. There are far more respectful professors (and that I respect more than him) who have said that I am their best student. A couple of them said they are willing to give me the internship but they are slightly less good (not bad, mind you). Given that at this point I feel I have temporarily lost interest in the subject, my gut thinks that it is better to change direction and be followed by a professor who respects me, my mind and my capacity for critical reasoning but I also think that I'm overreacting, but I surely felt disrespected.

**TL;DR**: lost respect for my (ex?) future supervisor that: changed his mind about the start date of my internship, said to me that he have to reconsider my application because of a STUPID oversight on a not-very-relevant written exam. The problem is that his lab is well funded, he publish on good journals several times in a year and that carrier-wise is a good choise to join that lab, but my gut tells me that it's not worth to damage my mental health.

I've been deeply involved in research for the past 6 years now. I started working in a lab my Junior year of high school, and as soon as I started undergraduate, I joined a biochem lab fall semester of my freshman year. In that lab, I worked for the duration of my freshman year, the summer between my freshman and sophomore years, and for all of sophomore year. The summer between my sophomore and junior year, I did an REU (Amgen) in a neuroscience lab, and after some reflection, I decided that starting in the fall semester, I wanted to leave my lab that I had worked in for my first two years of undergrad and join a lab more suited to my interests (neuroscience).

I'm going to stop here and make a note-- at the risk of sounding like I'm tooting my own horn, at this point I felt like I was a superb grad school candidate. I had years of different research experience, I really really liked learning (I usually read papers in my free time, for example), and my grades in undergrad were really good.

So fall semester of my Junior year of college I joined a neuroscience lab, in line with my interests. I work there pretty uneventfully for the semester, but at the end of the semester my PI sits me down and out of the blue tells me that he's going to have to fire me, since he had been monitoring my work and thought that I wasn't cut out for research since I was too ""erratic."" That really sucked at the time, but I picked myself up and I applied to labs again over winter break, and I joined yet another neuroscience lab my spring semester of my junior year. This was a new PI, so she hired me as a lab tech and the lab for the semester and the summer was just me and her. I had my own project and I thought I was doing really well, until one week I was doing IHC and used the wrong secondary antibody, and ruined a set of tissue. My PI informed me that since she was new and didn't have very much tissue to do experiments on, and because I had ruined a set, she couldn't trust me to run any more experiments with them. She said that hiring me was a mistake, and that she should have ""hired a senior research technician instead."" We had had a good relationship, but once again I had gotten fired out of the blue. 

So here I am now. I've been really involved and passionate about research for a really long time, but for whatever reason, I got fired from two labs back to back in less than a year. I've talked to other grad students, friends involved in research, and faculty at my school, and opinions range from ""that seems really unlucky, it's not a big deal"" to ""yeah, everything that happened seems justified."" I've also done a lot of reflecting, and I've realized that I don't *love* bench work. I think bench work is fine, but my real passions are in learning and teaching. I like talking and thinking about science, and I think all these years actually doing the science has been just a means to that end?

So.... what now? The original plan was to stay with this lab that I just got fired from for a year after I graduated, and then applying to grad school after. But now that I've gotten fired, my graduation is coming up very soon and I don't really have post-graduation plans anymore. Do I try to get a position in yet another lab in the fall? Do I even put these two labs on my resume? My mental health has been a complete wreck the past month, and I've decided to post here in the hopes of someone helping me out.",2,2019-08-09 03:41:30,AskAcademia

We have had a tough year, moved to the US leaving friends and family far behind, we have a young child, and new jobs which we had to establish ourselves in. She has only been in this lab for under 9 months and maybe these are ""teething problems"" but I worry how she will be able to keep going for the 4 or so years of contract she has left.

The way I cope - by giving myself time outs to come here for example, by not working beyond a time of day, and not working weekends if not absolutely necessary don't work for her - if anything they stress her more. She has had mental health support in the past and I am trying to get her some more.

I don't really see a future with my current major though, and now considering to switch &amp; redo a master abroad. I'm thinking about applying to a conversion master in software engineering, but the admission requirements page specifically said academic performance at bachelor level is crucial. So, do I even stand a chance? Is there anything I can do to compensate?

mt60r,[deleted],,Feeling lost with life goals - want to go back to school,"I received my BA in 2010 in American Studies with a minor in Education. I want to eventually be a professor in American history in the long term, did some K-12 tutoring and test writing and stuff, but the jobs never lasted long. The state of education in this country is frighteningly poor. I decided not to pursue being a K-12 teacher because my school district was handing out pink slips left and right. Now higher education jobs are few and far between. Literally thousands of people are applying for one job. I love history with all my heart, but I worry about walking out with a Master's and a thesis, and the job market being this fierce.

In the meantime, I (barely) pay the bills by working at a cemetery. There's not a lot of engaging activities for me within this particular company (ie their policies and the like), but I do like doing some of the grief counseling aspects, working with people. My ex was a disabled Army veteran, and I found it really fascinating on an intellectual level, to gain insight into his mental processes as he struggled with readjusting to civilian life. I would try to get information out of him, but he always got a little bit weary as I'd try to pick his brain (he doesn't like psychiatrists). I realized that like working with people in crisis. I need a new job, so I've started looking for work in treatment and grief/counseling centers, start off as a clerk or an admin assistant, and working on volunteering at the VA or with other vet centers. 

The question I have is that if I wanted to pursue something in this field, academically, I really enjoy doing research work, and I love academia, writing papers (I never thought I'd live to see the day that I'd miss writing papers). I don't know which field I'd go into if I either did a second BA or an MA. I was thinking either Psychology or Sociology. I was looking at my original field, American Studies, but like Sociology, that'd be an overview. Mental health is a field that is expected to have some growth over the next few years, too. I made an appointment at the local university to get some advising. 

I was wondering if anyone had any ideas. I feel really lost not being in school anymore and it's hard not to feel discouraged in this economy. I've emailed my old college advisors, but they've just told me that I should go back to grad school. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1,2011-11-29 08:55:23,AskAcademia
k34ete,stopmkngsense,t2_5xaucbf6,Should I Stay or Should I Go? Thinking about quitting my PhD (UK),"TL;DR - 2nd year student on the verge of quitting, after a cavalcade of things going wrong. Physical and mental health issues have been both a cause and symptom of these difficulties. Haven't enjoyed the PhD at all so far and am still really unclear what I am researching. Is it time to quit?

. . . . .

Hi, I am in the 2nd year of my PhD. Much has gone wrong from the start - people often laugh wryly if I say this and say that's not unusual, but it seems amiss that I have barely enjoyed it at all and have been unable to get stuck into my research. I am concerned that maybe doing a PhD is not right for me - or at least this project isn't, in these circumstances, right now. 

I am constantly battling with trying to keep going, thoughts of being a failure if I quit, and gratitude that I have a funded PhD, so an obligation to just crack on with it - but I also have a nagging sense that although it's meant to be really hard work, it's probably not meant to be quite so awful?! With apologies for the long read, I would really appreciate some viewpoints. 

I have been really stressed throughout my PhD. I felt able to embark on it because of a good working relationship with my main supervisor (it was a research project specifically created by them and based on their work), who promptly left within a few weeks of me starting. For various reasons they weren't able to maintain long distance contact and help me get on track, so I lost their specific knowledge and key networks. I had more tricky upheaval with the remainder of my supervisors too (I'm cautious about going into specifics so as not to identify them) and major problems to resolve with how we worked together.

I now have a nice, sharp-thinking lead supervisor, but who is only tenuously connected to my area of study, and as a very senior academic has very little time to guide me. I have felt like I have been on my own with this PhD throughout, and while I get that is the nature of independent research, I feel I could have done with a bit more input. I feel like I am flailing and lacking direction, though I also recognise my responsibility in this, and often give myself a hard time wondering how I could have done or do it differently (for example, I know there are some key skills I should have worked harder on last year), or just berate myself for being ill so much.

The stress, which is bad enough that I'm now signed off sick and means I'm behind with a key milestone, has negatively affected my relationship with my partner, overall mental health, and, frustratingly, my ability to read and write (which previously were things I loved). I have also been physically ill for much of the PhD (which has resulted in taking time out), and it is hard to separate out what is causing what issue. I can't concentrate, my memory has become really bad and I quickly feel overwhelmed. I have very little energy and motivation, and can get quite low, which makes it hard to feel bold and enthusiastic in my research work, and my organisation (of my ideas and papers) is as a result pretty terrible. 

I have however been able to do a small amount of teaching which I'd say was a mixed success, I've done some fieldwork, received ethical approval, got through year 1 milestones, have been to the odd conference, and formed a working relationship with an industry partner despite inherent difficulties there (a collaboration which I have sadly now lost due to Covid, though in honesty it was not exactly thriving).

I had a research plan which felt a bit tenuous but that I hoped I could bluff / fake it until I make it, despite the supervisory issues and issues with my industry partner - until Covid hit. Now I am needing to change the research significantly so that I can continue through Covid (it involved international research, practical group work etc), while managing a stressful home situation compounded by being more at risk from Covid due to my health issues. I have stalled. I am keenly aware that I need to make progress, that I cannot manage without the income provided by the funding, and also that my funder requires me to have an industry partner.

But it could also be a great opportunity to redirect my research to something I can feel motivated about, if only I could find the energy and self-belief, and work out what to tackle first. Equally, I am not a young student and I am keenly aware of the opportunity cost too (and health cost) of bashing my head against a PhD that isn't working. I know I sound sorry for myself but I am hoping that by laying it out like this, someone more experienced might be able to pinpoint what I could do to make it work, or whether I should call it a day.

I applied for a (non-academic) short-term job recently and noticed an upswing in my mood, from being interviewed for an area I'm skilled in, and a remote Covid-safe job with achievable set tasks each day, that I feel I could manage despite the issues described above. I am so tired of feeling like a self-doubting loser (which again I understand can be part of pushing the boundaries of new knowledge!). They offered me the job and are currently chasing up references etc. I could do whatever hours at work I wanted, so it could be feasible to still do the PhD (or do it part-time). But equally, I could suspend or leave my PhD.

Some students can fully concentrate on the course, some have families/work to handle. Some express that the pandemic affect their mental health (I totally understand).

I would love to keep the same amount of workload because some are performing very well. I am considering setting up two mechanisms for assignments/tasks. One with due dates; students who turn in on time will be graded based on full points. The other is self-paced. Students can turn in their work any time but the grades will be reduced 10% from the full points and then based on their work quality. How do you think about that solution?

I usually do not post in this part of reddit, but I have an issue pertaining to academia that I need some help with. I am currently on the way to completing my master's in English and I already have a master's in philosophy. When I was an undergrad however, I transferred a few times and I ended up at a school in upstate New York. There I had an issue with a professor disclosing my mental health information and I filed a complaint. This complaint has haunted me ever since I made it and I am afraid of retaliation of the part of the professor because he is in my field and I want to apply for PhD programs. After my complaint, he told me I was semi-literate idiot and that I could not read books. Because of my mental health issues, I have had a hard time regaining my confidence after this episode. I am still productive in terms of reading and writing, but it is hard to continue on knowing that no matter what I do, most people will think I am an illiterate bastard  in my field. I have gotten accepted into programs, but no matter what I do, this situation comes up because my area of philosophy is relatively small, and the professors know one another. I am not sure what to do. I have worked hard in the intervening years to improve myself, but it seems like, if I stay  in academia, this will always follow me around.",1,2020-07-09 04:40:02,AskAcademia

grqo3v,g00d_vibrations,t2_4lgi43na,What would You do with a Grad Student Like Me?,"I'm in a tough spot in my PhD right now (neuroscience), and I'm wondering if there's any PI's out there that could give me insight into A) how they would perceive a student like me (ex: a disappointment? promising but has problems?), and B) what (if anything) my advisor could do to help me move towards graduation faster. This is a little bit long but I would so so so appreciate any feedback. Here's my deal:

I'm at the end of my 4th year in a neuro PhD program. Most people graduate around 5.5 years in. I have dual undergraduate degrees in chemistry and psychology. I was a pretty promising 1st year rotation student - worked my ass off, was very engaged with the scientific problems at hand, did an extra long rotation, got along great with the rest of the lab. My main flaws were that I did my undergrad in a different field and most of my research experience was computational/data-analysis oriented, so my lab skills and background knowledge were so-so.

The 1st year of my program was classes, rotations, etc. The 2nd year I joined the lab I’m in now and then worked like crazy to get my project off the ground. In retrospect, I was doing too much for a newbie - each week I was doing time-consuming behavioral training, viral injection surgeries (I was new to even working with animals, let alone doing brain surgery on them), and calcium imaging. I also was mentoring an undergrad, and attempting to submit NSF and NRSA grants. I had very little mentorship from my PI during this time, although he is in general very approachable so this is partly my fault (I was trying to not bother him and show independence).

At the beginning of my 3rd year, my advisor didn't get some funding he expected so I had to teach. Here is where I'll mention that I have ADHD (inattentive, diagnosed very young and re-diagnosed multiple times throught development and in adulthood… aka I wasn't diagnosed freshman year of college cuz classes got hard). My workload became too much for me to bear. At some point I cut the behavior part out of the project in order to reduce my workload, but apparently it wasn't enough. During the second half of my 3rd year, I started having mental health problems (I also have bipolar II.. yeah), my performance declined, and I started missing days of work due to anxiety attacks, depression, and mixed manic episodes.

At the beginning of my 4th year I had a little mental breakdown and had to tell my PI what was going on (he basically asked me what was going on with me). He was surprisingly understanding of my situation. We decided to delay one deadline that was approaching, and to move forward by having weekly meetings. All in all, things seemed to be improving slowly but surely. I was working at a bit of a slower pace than what I consider ideal (not working weekends for the sake of my mental health, etc), but my work was higher quality and the progress felt steady and consistent. However, I still had yet to reach the VERY first project benchmark I had set out for myself at the beginning of all this (for anyone who cares, I'm trying to get DREADDs to express in a brain region so that I can suppress that region, and I've failed to demonstrate whether this method is working successfully or not). I should mention here that I perform lab work much slower than most other people, probably because I adhere strictly to my protocols and spend a lot of time setting up and preparing for each surgery/experiment etc. I beleive this is due to my ADD - without taking this extra effort, I make dumb mistakes. I've noticed that my mind does not seem to ""automate"" things well.

Then, covid hit. Lab access is severely restricted, and the animal care facilities people have put up a ton of new rules (I've gotten in trouble for breaking animal care facility rules several times before - nothing sinister, just my fucking ADD making me forget things and misunderstand rules in the first place). 

Originally my boss said no one should go into lab at all, but I asked if I could finish up some experiments. He got me approval to do that. The next day I found out that I could resubmit my NRSA in 3 weeks. I didn’t make much progress with experiments during that time because (surprise surprise) grant writing is hard for me but I really care about getting good at it so I dedicated a lot of time to it (plus I want the grant, obviously). Then I finished up the main parts of the experiments, but I haven’t sectioned the brains yet (last step). 

Next week is my week to give lab meeting. I told my boss 2 weeks ago from today that I wanted to present a (really cool) journal article that he had sent out to the lab email group earlier this quarter. He told me I should try to present data, and I said I didn’t think it would be fully done by then. Today I sent him another email asking if I could be scheduled to do sectioning next week (last step of data collection), and also saying again that I wanted to present the article for lab meeting, not data. My PI is notoriously non-confrontational. But, he sent me an email back saying in a frustrated tone that I’ve “been lucky to be able to do experiments during the lockdown, and I keep pushing it back”, and that he wants me to finish the sectioning this week and present the data at lab meeting. 

I don’t want to do that because A) there’s so much pressure to get in and get out of lab super quickly because only 2 people can be in at a time and it’s very booked up, B) I hate having less than a week to digest my data and put together a presentation, and this will give me only 3-4 days, during which C) I have to grade 100 homework assignments, and D) I would have to work through the weekend, which, I know a lot of people say you have to work on the weekends to be successful, but I am currently of the opinion that you need to “save” working weekends for when it’s really necessary. This is not one of those cases (I mean I’ll be grading this weekend but that’s it). Last month, when I was working furiously to meet the grant deadline - \*thats\* when working all weekend is warranted, IMO. Even if I have awesome results, I can’t get back into lab even part time for at least 2 more weeks. 

When I got my PI’s email I got super pissed off and also sad because it reinforced my sense of being incompetent . After calming down just a bit I wrote him an email that was a bit snarky at first but then I went on to “be real” with him. I told him I feel like he thinks that I’m not progressing fast enough and that I agree. I told him that I’ve noticed I’m not very good at lab work, and wish I was doing a data-focused project like I had done in undergrad. I told him I’m worried about graduating on time. I asked for his advice. 

I want to mention here that in the past year since recovering from my little breakdown last summer, I’ve started to realize that I’m a very good conceptual thinker and that I’d rather do some line of work/research that focuses on that. For instance, I’m very into neurophilosophy and my favorite thing to learn about is general principles in neuroscience like circuit motifs, etc. I just like connecting the dots across different areas of research, and I’m good at it. I’d waaaaay rather do a lit review than an experiment! In the future, whether I stay in academia or not, I don’t want to do anymore non-human animal experiments. I want to work mainly with data and theories. The main hurdle to this is I need to improve my math and programming background, but I know if I had the time I could. I’m already working on this in my spare time to the extent that I can.

Here’s what I want to know: What the f\*ck do you think my PI thinks of me? Is my behavior normal for a grad student? Like is what I’m going through common for certain personalities in grad school? Is there any advice you would give to my PI in how to best deal with a student like me?

Here the final thing I want to say because I just need to get it off my chest. If you read this far, I thank you very much. As a kid I was always considered either really smart or really dumb, depending on what age/grade/teacher etc (and not in monotonic way..). I’ve always had this massive fear that I’m never going to be able to function well in society, because I always seem to be bad at my job (worked in food service for a long time and was always getting fired cuz I sucked). I actually dropped out of high school and didn’t start college until like 22. Science research became kind of a safe space for me at that point in my life, because all of my other deficiencies didn’t really matter since I was so good at learning and thinking about science (probably because I’m so interested in it). But now I feel like I’ve hit a wall where, I can’t keep up with the demands of this career field. It’s not that I had a big dream of being an academic per say, it just sucks to fail at something I care so much about. It's pathetic that no matter how hard I've tried so far, I'm still failing, almost 5 years in.",1,2020-05-27 19:37:40,AskAcademia
gi6cfq,Poppy_pie,t2_475wkv1i,What methodology would be used for this Honours Thesis Question about ethics of pragmatic policy?,"Sorry if this is not the right place to ask - if it isn't any suggestions on where to go please let me know. I did read the rules but couldn't join homework help and college seemed more like undergrad than research and unsure if it fits here or there :) 

Firstly: I do not want to provoke a political argument. I want to know how to research the problem. I know people will have strong opinions but I want to know how to unpack it. I am unsure on the correct answer or even if there is a 'definitive answer' which is why I thought it was a good research problem.   


\- Honours thesis / Social Science / Policy analysis(?) / methodology confusion

This is about research methodology not about answering the question (I will attempt that in the thesis)

Honours study is isolating, COVID HONOURS is even more so.  

**QUESTION:** 

&gt;**""Is pragmatic policy making ethical policy making"" ?**

  
Background:

I'm still trying to get a working question for my thesis and thats what I have so far.   


(Content advice: sensitive material below).

My question on pragmatic policy being ethical will be examined through using a case study of a policy proposal that wants to implement secure theraputic facilities for at-risk young people; The proposal I am using as a case study argues to divert specific groups of at-risk young people who otherwise would end up in prison or a form of secure welfare we have in my state (short term stays in locked ""homes"") a lot of kids go through these locked up homes like 'revolving doors' and really get the help they need into a more lasting theraputic home that could help them (prison produces more harm also).  

 (E.g Twelve year old girl, being fed drugs, with predatory men and not engaging in treatment, and say 'offending' as well - going in and out of these programs but not getting adequate help).

The rationale for this proposal is that it will reduce the harms that are happening to these kids now through offering better alternatives to the options they currently have (but the **problem** is that it still does not address the broader structural issues that create and entrench these issues). Aka its pragmatic policy.

So thus my question is: Is pragmatic policy such as the one above *ethical* policy making?  Using that policy proposal as a case study - using policy analysis?  


Are we plugging holes in a bad ship and not addressing the bad ship is unethical because it will doom so many in the future (I suck at metaphors).

**My question to the academics here:**  


What good methodology to explore this would be? I feel like 'policy analysis' suits but I don't know if thats right. I was originally doing discourse, content or narrative analysis (with some background theory of Capital via Bourdieu - there is a lot of background research showing social capital to be a major determining factor behind outcomes) but my question was slightly different and now it doesn't make sense to use that. Well I can still use Bourdieu for relevant things. But yeah any thoughts on methods?  I have all the readings. I just feel overwhelmed.

What methodology would I use? How could I unpack this?

\- It will be narrowed down to my country/my specific state where possible/specific demographics/within my field (Social science/social work/social policy). 

&amp;#x200B;

Further background if needed:

To reiterate the problem: There is an issue that by continuing to make concessions and implementing 'pragmatic policy' because we cannot wait for society to address broader structural issues that produce disadvantage and adversity (more money for housing, welfare, healthcare - not just money but effective reformation as well as cultural changes in how many mental health issues are seen, particularly drug dependency) etc etc. We risk many lives be digging in our heels and waiting.

But if we 'hold out' because we know this is a way to simply distract from overarching broad social problems, then we inherently reinforce those issues and prevent them being addressed?  (Im Australian so we have higher welfare expenditure but our social mobility is slowing sadly its not what it used to be, but we have free healthcare etc so its within this climate)  

I just want to know peoples thoughts as studying honours is SO ISOLATING then add COVID and its like being given a sheet of paper saying ""do this"" and being sat alone in a room with a PC.

At this time Im working on a method to answer this question. Opinions are welcome but I really don't have an answer either way and thats good, I just want to unpack the question through research. I am just trying to learn how too.",1,2020-05-12 07:20:22,AskAcademia

gk59gn,Mute_Commentary,t2_6cyelee4,Help?? I've been accused of academic dishonesty,"[I was sent an email](http://imgur.com/gallery/88kJNFv) from my professor claiming I had violated the academic integrity standards of our university. I really don't know what to do and I have had terrible anxiety over this since I got the email. Here is the backstory:

I took the final exam and did decently well. My friend did not take the final exam on the date it was given. She asked for an extension and the prof gave her an extension of one hour. She took two days to complete the exam. She submitted her exam and received an email saying that it is too late and there are clear indications that she collaborated with others (assuming me). A few days later I get that email. I have been reading about these things and honestly do not know what to do. I was under the assumption that students were innocent of violations until proven guilty, but it seems like that is not the case and all that is necessary is reasonable suspicion?? She did not copy off of my exam, but we are close and have studied together quite often throughout the semester. My professor also declined to tell me what his ""proof"" is or if I am in fact being accused of giving the answers or something entirely different. I did not post online about the exam, and I did not send her my exam. But I do not have my work from the exam since it was online, and I am extremely worried they will ask me a question on the spot and I will be too anxious to answer and they will consider that proof. I really don't know how this works or what to do. I am trying to get into a very competitive program at my university and a violation like this would completely ruin my chances. I know there is no damning evidence, but I also have no idea how to prove my innocence?? If I am in a he said/she said with the professor, I fear I will lose the hearing. Should I get a lawyer to help me with this? Should I be aggressive and act overly angry to communicate my outrage? I have had problems with this professor throughout this semester and actually sent an email about my concerns to the dean ( this was a couple days before I got reported). I'm worried that my obvious contempt will work against me. I actually had contacted the dean because I had some very bad stuff happen to close family members of mine to which the professor showed no sympathy, and I was saying that his class has been bad for my mental health as I have been working through this traumatizing event.

To preface, I am absolutely in love with doing research. In the face of COVID, my lab has started to run a lot of different projects and I have taken the lions share of responsibility in maintaining the study (I.e., survey design, data management, data cleaning, data analysis), while also working on quite a few other projects on the side. One thing that worries me is that I've found it impossible for me to step away from my work. For example, when trying to take a mental health day I will be continually checking my phone and email to put out potential fires that arise without me being there. I guess my overall question is: How can I pull myself away from my work, so that I can ""recharge my batteries"" before the semester resumes?",1,2020-05-14 05:38:09,AskAcademia

It was an integrated life sciences masters with strong strands of teaching in Chemistry, Biochem and Clinical studies. It's been a couple of years since I graduated and I have since continued to advance vocationally by moving into more difficult, clinical fields and continuing my learning and professional development. 

The way I've been going about my search for a PhD, is by viewing advertisements for fully-funded studentships at various UK Universities in my related field; Pharmacy, Pharmaceutics, Biochem, Toxicology etc. But I'm a little stuck at: what to do next, how to go about it and whether I stand a chance as a candidate considering my academic history.

Unfortunately during my undergrad I suffered from (verifiable) mental health issues which led to various resits. I was lucky in that I brought it around during my Masters year to attain a 2.1. Due to this my transcript would look pretty terrible without a decent explanation. I was able to attain a 1st in my dissertation in my Masters level research of Computational Chemistry which may stand in my favour.

I am also applying to PhDs that; while similar to my academic skillset, may be tailored towards those with a more stereotypical 'scientific' focused undergraduate degree.  I was hoping someone may have advice with regards to the following:

1. Will my poor transcript and my undergraduate degree being a tad more life science-ish affect my chances of getting onto a PhD in, for example, Pharmacology?
2. How do I apply to studentships? Is it normal to strike up friendly conversation with the supervisors listed in the advertisement first? And then what? Send my CV and a covering letter?
3. Obviously it is important to assimilate more knowledge on the proposed area of research. To what extent do I need to pursue this at this stage? Should I be prepared to have a detailed understanding of the topics prior to enquiry?

Any help would be much appreciated.",1,2020-05-09 16:23:10,AskAcademia
gg06zd,longshortwsb,t2_3za8o7ux,Burnout from undergrad assistant,"So I'm currently in my 4th year of undergrad and I've been working for a prof for a year now. At first,  the workload was manageable but recently, I feel like a lot is being asked from me. I'm currently working ""smaller"" tasks like preparing his tenure promotion paperwork, writing grants, and reviewing other people's papers prior to submission. And often these tasks are asked out of nowhere, even though I already have a ton of work lined up. This is on top of my normal project. He also wants me to help with other big projects he has planned. Not to mention, we are asked to meet online with only 1-2 days notice 2-3 times a week.

I feel like he is asking a lot from me since I am constantly getting emails in the middle of the night asking for me to do stuff on short deadlines. Often times, his email chains to me are just him replying to himself with notes and pdfs attached to it. And it takes me hours to just sift through the emails and categorize everything because it's so incoherent. 

At this point, I feel sick looking at excel documents and I think it's taking a hit on my mental health. Whenever I hear an email, I feel dread. As well, I have basically no time left to study and spend for myself. I'm currently being paid based on an award for my normal project.  but the pay is less than minimum wage given the hours I have to put in for the other tasks I'm charged with.

I am currently a master's student, and my mentor for my current research has just extended an opportunity to work with him on another research project he is doing that will begin next year when my current project is over. I am super super stoked on the role, and I am really honored he thought of me. 

That being said, the project involves going to another country for an extended period of time (most likely 12ish months). I have bipolar II and have just recently started medication for it, as I was previously unmedicated. I haven't started discussing specific logistics about the project with him in terms of living arrangements and such, but I will definitely need to consider how I will continue my treatment for bipolar. I have searched the internet for information about mental/general health care where I will be going, but I didn't find anything helpful that even slightly addressed my concerns. 

Basically, when him and I do start discussing logistics of living abroad, I feel that I should ask him about medical care, and I feel like I should do so with the added info of ""I am asking because I have bipolar disorder"" so that he doesn't think I am just asking a general question rather I am asking with a specific reason, and he can hopefully give me better resources or find resources for me or send me in the right direction (he does work in this other country a lot). 

Do you think this is appropriate? I feel like he is the only good source I have to ask, so I worry if I say ""I am asking for a medical condition"" without further details he won't really be able to give me the answers I am looking for. But I also worry about crossing a professional boundary, and don't want him to be concerned that bringing me abroad would be a liability in some way. I feel like we have a good relationship, and I dont think he would be judgmental, I just don't really know the best way to approach the conversation.

ga5h0d,atheoryofjustice,t2_4aualvqw,Question On Writing Letter for a Professor Applying for Tenure,"Greetings, posters of r/AskAcademia. A Professor I deeply respect has asked me to write a letter recounting my experience as a student in a few of their classes so that they can add it to their tenure application.

This Professor has played an instrumental role in my academic success this year, allowed me to focus on mental health as opposed to academic work whenever I requested such accommodation, and has taught me a great deal on various topics both within and beyond my field of study.

As so, I am hoping to write them the most supportive letter possible so I can, even if only incrementally, help them achieve tenure. So, I wonder:

* Are there any critical things that should be included/what qualities hiring committees are especially interested in? (I would not lie, of course, if I thought they did not possess one of these qualities, but if they did, I would surely make this a point of emphasis)
* Are there any things that would seem positive to me, but perhaps not so positive to a hiring committee? E.g., he believed me to be a good student of his and, as of result, was very accomodating; however, I don't want to make it come across as though he is extremely lenient, for example. 
* Initially, I had planned to write anywhere between 3-5 pages single spaced, but I fear now this might be overkill?
* Should I focus on factors such as my enjoyment of the syllabus, class structure, etc. or would I be better served speaking to their ability as a lecturer/coordinator of class discussions and also someone that can be turned to in times of need? Or perhaps some conjunction of both? More specifically, do they want to know if this Professor is great instructor or great person? 
* Finally, his courses really stood out to me because I found them far more intellectually demanding than most, causing me to put a genuine effort in that I sometimes failed to do in other courses. Hopefully mentioning this will not make him appear as though they are overly difficult?

Nothing to do with my PhD, I already had problems before. But it got slightly worse during the PhD. The specific problem is obvious to me, although the solution isn't clear at all - I always feel like I'm not doing my best. I feel like I'm not working hard enough unless I spend most of my day working. I always try to aim for 8 hours a day, but I rarely can - I start to feel anxious, stressed, about my work. That it isn't good enough, that I'm going to fail, that I'm a fraud, etc. I simply don't feel good about my work. don't get me wrong, I love academia and I don't see myself doing anything else. But exactly because of that, I'm afraid of failing. Of not being able to get a job after my contract is over. Of someone finding out a crucial error on my methods, particularly now that I'm starting to develop independent work that it isn't supervised by anyone.  

On top of that, my social life sucks. I don't have many friends, due to moving to another country. My hobbies are mostly lonely activities. And, to make things worse, I'm in a country where I don't speak the main language. I'm learning the language, but it will take long before I can actually maintain a conversation in this language. I have a dog, and helps me a bit. But it isn't enough. Dating has been hard too - either I don't find people interesting enough, or - when I do - they don't find me interesting enough. 

I don't know what can help me. I just feel hopeless. I know that a permanent job - for instance, a tenure-track position - would help me a lot by creating some stability in my life, by allowing me to develop relationships without the fear of losing later on when I have to move. But that's something that I can do very little about, and I'm afraid that my state of mind will sabotage my chances. Holidays didn't work either, I simply go back to the same state of mind as soon as the holidays are over.

My situation:

I'm a PhD student whose confirmation is now nearly 6 months behind schedule for  a variety of reasons but primarily because I have been dealing with chronic mental health difficulties that flared up last year/beginning of this year. So that folks understand where I'm coming from, my mental cocktail is a combination of ADHD, bipolar, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. I've been open about all this, as much as has been necessary, but the administration side of dealing with the delays had been very anxiety inducing and until I got a disability plan in place last week, had been preventing me from being able to move on.   


My supervisor has been beyond helpful, and they are all I could have ever asked for as far as them being understanding goes but I feel like I'm nothing but a disappointment to them. For the past 3-4 months I've been ""climbing back on the bike"" so to speak, but I'm slow and easily tired. I'll manage a good day and then have several bad days in a row. Not ""getting nothing done"" but definitely not getting enough done. Today I handed over organizing of research group meetings once a fortnight because that was also draining me, but part of that was because it was meant to be a shared role - but my co-organizer was never able to be involved from the beginning of the year. I'm not blaming them, it's my fault for not being more proactive about dealing with it, but I feel like a failure.   


I'm competent, and have good ideas (based on feedback), but I'm slow and find the writing aspect very anxiety inducing. I'm working through that, and learning to like it more, but I'm still slow. I'm identifying that my current leak is in my executive functions, my ability to organize my days and weeks around the many competing needs of my academic life... and failing to focus my energies on my research because of that.

I can hardly focus, I can hardly retain information, and on bad days I immediately begin to have a panic attack when I open up a textbook for one of my classes. I’m trying to learn Mandarin this semester and I got a C on our first midterm. I’m not surprised, but seeing that mark broke me because I’m trying so flipping hard but just getting nowhere. 

What the hell should I do? I had to leave my class this morning ten minutes in because I suddenly started to bawl and became inconsolable, and I’ve remained in this state of panic all day long (if my post reads like a freakout, that’s why). I recently had to get an extension on a heavily-weighted assignment for another one of my classes because I’m apparently such a dumbass that I can’t even get that done.

Do you ever feel like you’re just not cut out for the Academia route mid-PhD but then freak out and wonder what this all means then? I am motivated by the research but disenfranchised by the politics and lack of job security. I’ll never be the best in my field, nor do I think my current lack of balance/mental health is worth it. Has anybody had any experience with this, and perhaps gone a non-academic route post PhD that they’re willing to share?

To make matters worse, I feel constantly at odds with my supervisory team. I feel like we communicate on two different planes (I’m the sensitive and overly nice type, they’re the direct and/or somewhat aggressive type/s). They question my progress and negatively skew a lot of our interactions (highlight what I do wrong, and not what I do right). Which is in turn hindering my progress more. Does anyone have any experience or advice (and no, I don’t have the opportunity to change supervisors) on how to manage this? I’m at the point where my meetings with them is causing me large amounts of stress. I’m basically losing confidence by the minute in my abilities. If I successfully complete, I wonder how much this aspect of my PhD is impacting my overall negative attitude of Academia - I have heard of more positive experiences in external labs.

Due to coronavirus and a bunch of other circumstances, including mental health issues, I’m on an indefinite leave of absence. I’m missing my classes and my studies enormously at the moment but I don’t know when I’ll be able to return. I’m in a very remote environment with barely any friends or people I know so I have more than enough time on my hands. 

I love research (I’m in the humanities) and especially enjoy reading contemporary scholarship. As in, I will do it for fun. However, I’m not the most focused or diligent reader. I’d like to try and change that because I really do genuinely enjoy it when I actually put my mind to it. The problem is party structure. I want some kind of overarching pattern or structure that I build on. I have a great desire to understand the underpinnings and the backgrounds of things. But that can quickly become very expansive and unfocused. 

I’ve been reading random articles and here and there when I feel like it which is good but I’d love to feel like I really delved into something. I feel like I need a long term goal, like an independent study but just with myself. 

I guess what I’m asking is how do you guys manage to progress forward (with research/career goals) when you don’t any goal you are working toward? Is an article a day a good idea? is it pointless to read lots outside of my discipline? Should I just read all the classics? Are there an really good (quality) podcasts or online courses?

i8z2jb,randombjkfan1903,t2_3vmb9vc8,Allegations of miscount by ex girlfriend,"My ex is trying to get me kicked out of university

So I am an international student who studies in the UK, my ex was also an international student who was doing a 1 year Erasmus in the same University.

We had a really problematic break up during the coronavirus lockdowns when we were both outside the UK and she blocked me from everywhere. I tried to contact her a few times (I know I shouldn't have) from my secondary instagram account and my cousins phone and she blocked all of them. I tried talking to some people whom I thought were common friends but they were all very rude to me on text. I accept this behavior to be unsolicited contacts.

So in the end, after being blocked by my ex during the coronavirus lockdown(unable to leave my house) and being ignored by all of our common friends, my mental health really declined I texted her mom (whom I never met) on Facebook and I told her that my ex had some of property in her room back in the UK and I told her that we bought plane tickets together and I would appreciate if they could let me know whenever they could get a refund since the flight was canceled dude to the virus outbreak.

I told her the exact amount of money and gave her a full list of the items that are still under the possession of her daughter. The list included: toothbrush, contact lenses, pyjamas, t-shirts, sweatshirts, hairdryer, bondage, lubricant and condoms. Now before anyone here judges me let me state that I am not proud of this behavior.

So after that her mom called me a liar multiple times and used offensive language against me. 

At that point I told her that I was not a liar and I could send pictures of us but was afraid that sending them without her consent could cause problems. 

She accused me of being a liar again.

At that point I made a google search and saw that I could send non explicit pictures.

I told her mom that I could send non explicit pictures.

She accused me of being a liar again.

I have sent her a selfie of us in a bus. Just 2 people taking a selfie.

She used offensive language again and I did not say anything.

The same day, someone I have never met, a friend of my ex sent me a message on Instagram. Texted me 4 paragraphs of swearing and threatening to kill me. 

I told them I only wanted my money and my property back and was left no other options other than to text her mom.

So my ex complained to the university about me and she still goes around bragging about this complaint while the university doesn’t seem to care about me.

In her complaint, my ex gave lots of fake evidence by deleting some of the messages sent by her and her friends to me. I have screenshots of them.

I have defended myself during a hearing. I told the university that I did these things under these circumstances and I am not proud of them. I stated that I did not mean any harm. In the end, my case was referred to the committee of discipline by a disciplinary officer. This only happens in serious cases.

I really don't know what to expect. Do people actually get kicked out of university for such things? What would you advice me to do during the next hearing?",1,2020-08-13 12:32:41,AskAcademia

For the period I've worked as an RA, I've put in a lot of hard work and even secured a paper in a highly ranked global conference (withholding details to protect my identity).

Recently I've gone through some serious family problems, but have continued to work sincerely through them. However when the COVID-19 lockdown was enforced, I struggled to find a safe place to stay, and ensure groceries were available. There were also issues  associated with other basic amenities. 

Also, I've been through some severe personal trauma over the years which began to resurface during the isolation and my mental health has taken a hit. I informed my current advisor of the situationand explained why my productivity has been very low, and how I'm working on building it back up. 

He did not take kindly to it, and gave me 3 days to come up with excellent progress to make up for 2 weeks lost. However, this was just not possible for me in my current state and I struggled to come up with great progress. He called me up, yelled at me for 20 minutes straight and told me he knew that my PhD admit had made my attitude lax. He threatened that if I didn't work extra hard for however long the quarantine continued, he would mess with my admit. He also wants biweekly updates on my progress. 

I'm really worried because this is something I've worked all my life for, through all trying circumstances, and he was one of my recommenders. This has taken a toll on my already affected mental health, and I'm finding it even harder to concentrate.

ftdf7z,Help_Me_Work,t2_57j6e6vb,I need some real help with my career progression. Just finished my doctoral degree with no first author papers to my name and can't land a job as even a research technician.,"I have just finished grad school with no first author papers to my name and I am struggling to get a job. I had mental health issues before starting my degree but was keeping them in check. Failure after failure and an unsupportive supervisor wound me up to breaking point. After finishing my experiments I had a breakdown and just left the laboratory completely, lapsing in good standing (Australia). I assumed I just wasn't going to finish and would let the final submission deadline pass me by. I got another job in a completely different field and every so often, would read through my thesis draft, get too anxious to function, and not look at it again for a few weeks. Rinse and repeat for like a year and a half. With 6 months to the final deadline, I somehow pulled myself together and finished the thing. I submitted last year and my thesis was finally accepted early this year.

Now I'm looking for jobs and am woefully underqualified. I have no chance at a postdoc since I have no first author papers and my research utilized quite niche and expensive technology, so nobody is working with it. I also haven't set foot in a lab for 2.5 years. I'm trying to sell myself on basic molecular and cellular biology experience but that's not good enough for a postdoc, so I'm applying for research assistant and technician positions. I really want to work as a research assistant because it'll be a good starting point to get back to lab work. With that said, it brings tears to my eyes applying for jobs that I was totally qualified for 7 years ago, when I first finished undergrad. And even then...I'm not getting the jobs. I've had two interviews that were really quite crushing - one in particular was a technician position where I felt like I was being interviewed for a postdoc - and now am quite sure I can't even get into my 'sure thing' line of work. And now Covid-19 has made everything worse, and there are literally no jobs in my field to apply for because everything is closed.

I just feel undone. I was a functional, confident 22 year old before starting my PhD. Now I'm a depressed and anxious 29 year old with absolutely no faith in myself or my work. I just want a job. I just want to be able to progress my career. Instead I'm sitting in my parents house, having lost what little work I did have due to Covid-19. How on earth am I supposed to come back from this? I have never felt more disheartened in my life. Because I finally did it. I got my shit together and defeated my white whale. And for what? For crippling mental health issues and 0 job prospects.

I am asking in earnest - what am I supposed to do from here? One of my PhD supervisors hasn't spoken to me in almost 3 years and the prospect of seeing him makes me want to die. The other one is nice but won't help me network for any positions, and I secretly believe he doesn't think I can do it so doesn't want to stick his neck out.

fsxmpz,joyfulali,t2_7mqdd,Leave of absence before comps?,"Hello all - 

I'm finishing up the second year of my PhD program. I am wrapping up my last course this month. Ostensibly, I should be registering for the comprehensive exam during the summer term with the expectation that it be completed (read, written, and defended) by August 31. Certainly, the program will be accommodating extensions to this date given the disruption of the world right now, but I am wondering what my best approach is given my own situation.

I have two school-aged children who are now home and being online-taught. While I'm grateful that their schools are providing online materials and instruction, it is still a lot of parental supervision. My spouse is an emergency physician working on the front lines of the battle and thus is not able to help much with the kids' needs. Of course, being this close to the health crisis is also bringing a lot of stress and worry to our family and I am feeling and seeing the mental health effects.

My supervisors have suggested that it might be wise to request a leave of absence for the summer term and to hope to resume in the fall, but are open to a later return if necessary depending on the state of things. The LOA would ""stop the clock"" on my PhD progression, and would preserve my funding when I eventually resume.  The alternative is to keep chugging along at it and hope that I can eventually dedicate the time, brainspace and energy to complete the comprehensive exam, but in the meantime continue to pay tuition (covered by scholarship). I would continue to receive my funding during that time but it's for a finite number of months so I would risk running out of funding time eventually.

Seems like a no-brainer to request the leave.  Will this be something I will forever have to justify and explain away? Will this make me seem like a weaker candidate later for grants or academic appointments? Should I just try to get through this without a leave so as to have an ""intact"" PhD period?

fopyhb,Anyun,t2_6s242,Gearing up for PhD application... not sure how to find professors,"I want to apply to PhD programs in Community Health/Population Health/Sociomedical Science/etc. My general interests are (1) health belief/behavior modeling with specific attention on the use of fear and social networks and (2) the use/efficacy of mass media and language, especially on the internet (ie memes) in health messaging. My issue has become that I can't seem to find professors that I align with at any public health uni. I did find and contact a professor at Michigan State's Communications Department that works using a health behavior modeling incorporating fear, so I will be applying there - I'm not worried that it's not a public health school, it's a great program but I also think it's super competitive and I might not be the right fit so I need more options. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't seem to find any other public health professors that I align with. I'm trying to find at least 3-5 professors I might be able to work with so I have 3-5 schools to apply to. I've read lots of papers (between 2-5 a week since I started my masters in 2017), chatted up a handful of professors, and searched through uni websites, but have not found work that directly relates to my interest, just a lot of stuff that supports my thoughts and positions but requires the mental leap I make from my work experience to connect to my propositions.

What do I do in this situation? Public Health PhD applications open in August and priority deadlines are at the beginning of December, so I'm starting to feel the pressure. I found some DrPH programs that I'm a good fit for, but I'm too interested in teaching and academia to not consider a PhD. The positive point of DrPH programs is that you don't need to find a perfect match with a prof to get in, just a few profs that are doing work related to your interests - but PhD programs seem different in that you need to find someone basically doing the same research you want to be doing in order to get in (or am I wrong about that).",1,2020-03-25 13:06:59,AskAcademia
fo8ofo,NaturalRattle,t2_3sm5s6eg,Ordinarily problematic professor being extra problematic during the pandemic (railing on us for what I would think is an understandable decline in performance) - is it worth directly addressing?,"I'm currently in graduate school. Like most, our program has gone completely online as of about 2 weeks ago.

My field, which all my classmates also work in, has gone from being stable to nearly nonexistent virtually overnight. I took a voluntary unpaid indefinite leave to protect my family (I have an immunocompromised dad and grandfather), some companies have closed indefinitely, and the rest are putting their employees/society in relative danger by encouraging them to just work in homes with clients exclusively (shifting from schools and clinics, where we're usually situated). In short, there is no ideal scenario for any of us at the present time and we are all suffering.

In truth, I've always found this particular professor's behavior needlessly petty and problematic. She often makes snide and cutting remarks in her feedback that aren't constructive - seemed more geared to offend than truly direct/guide. She's a notoriously tough grader. Even her clear favorites complain about how overly ""nitpicky"" and ""anal"" she is. I never vibe with professors who have this authoritarian/hardass teaching style, and from a behavioral psychology standpoint (which I've studied at length), it's ultimately counterproductive, but I can understand it in ordinary times. Not everyone is warm and fuzzy. It is what it is.

I have two other professors who have been really supportive during this undeniably shitty time. One sent our class an email with a link unemployment resources in our state, well aware virtually all of us have lost our jobs (or had our hours slashed at minimum), and a counseling hotline number if our mental health was suffering. Another began our first (virtual) class by asking how the virus has been affecting us emotionally and in general - he called it a ""vent"" session, said he was here for us, gave us excellent and comforting advice, let my classmates cry for as long as they needed. Very standup of him and appreciated.

This other professor, though? Logged into my email today to find an extremely curt email - she skipped even greeting us - and told us that our work this past week has been extremely sub-par/poor quality and that she will fail us the next time we submit something similar. Zero acknowledgment of the current crisis. Just that tactless, obnoxious email.

Though I am usually a master internalizer, I'm not made of stone. This REALLY pissed me off. Do I agree our work this week was sub-par? I can't speak for my classmates, but I know my own work quality has suffered some. **To be clear, I don't want a better grade for admittedly shittier work. I just think she could've made the exact same point with much more tact and empathy,** and even minimal acknowledgment of the obvious: her students are suffering. People tend not to do amazing work when they're suffering - or, in this case, worrying how long they're gonna be able to afford to eat.

Now is a time when kindness and understanding means everything. That kindness could be the difference between someone keeping on and doing something to hurt themselves. I really don't think it's melodramatic to say that. I'm personally really going out of my way to check on people because that's a real concern I have - that my friends or family who already weren't doing so well mentally might choose this pandemic as the time to just end it all. I mean, hell, I've been sober for 5 years - I've generally never wanted to relapse more in my life (luckily I have a lot of other sober friends and we've been really leaning on each other to keep clean - grateful for that). Point being, people are at their breaking points. Students are not robots and they're allowed to slip a little and just be human. I found this email very unprofessional and am considering directly addressing it with her, and possibly her superior (probably further down the line, when this class is over).

i9bxfh,mathbiostudent,t2_mw62e,xPost from r/gradschool -- When is it worth spending the time and energy cost to revise and get previously unpublished manuscripts across the finish line?,"Got a PM suggesting I also post here as my topic was perhaps a better fit for here than r/GradSchool

**Background**: I had a recent chat with my advisor about my career plans after I graduate from my PhD. The three options I am considering consist of pursuing the private sector ""data science"" route (more pay, but I've already heard of my colleagues who've gone that route talking about long term job instability), pursuing the research scientist route in a US government lab (interesting work, but funding stability issues in early career and big unknowns with the election coming up), or trying to get on the statistician track at a government agency (my preferred route because of the job stability, work/life balance, and topical interest in keeping vital agencies running). 

I would like to continue doing something scientific in some form, but I'm not competitive enough and do not have the CV for R1 academia. My advisor is respectful of the fact that I am interested in alternative career tracks. However, with the present job climate and economic uncertainty, he said I should also keep my doors open to make sure I can maintain an income stream. He said that I shouldn't rule a research university post-doc out, and should utilize his connections to other PIs if necessary. This sounded like a worthwhile thing to keep in mind; years ago, a post-doc did indeed save my dad after he was fired from his industry job, and he was able to buy time with the post-doc before jumping back to a higher-paying position. 

**The Current Situation**: This leads me to my present area of uncertainty. My publication record is fairly weak for post-doc applications (I got involved with a failed startup during my PhD). My advisor said he could still help me land a position, but that to help myself, I needed to bolster my CV. I have one first-author paper that came out in a respected specialist journal and a middle-authorship on a megajournal paper. I'll hopefully be submitting one more first-author before I graduate. 

Prior to beginning my PhD, I did a post-baccalaureate fellowship and worked extensively on a couple of projects over the course of 2 years. My prior advisor during the fellowship wanted me to stay a third year to ensure that I would publish those projects, but I wanted to change fields at that point and also wanted to go to grad school as soon as possible because I was a little bit older of a student. I had manuscript drafts written up for both projects that my advisor said he would take over at that point and submit, but of course, the manuscripts got filed away after I left, and a few months thereafter, he had moved on to other projects. 

My current advisor mentioned that it would be very helpful for my academic CV to get out papers for at least one of the two abandoned projects and said that just in case I needed a post-doc, getting out one more paper could be a saving grace, even if the paper were from a different field. The mathematical methods I use do unify my research experience across the fields I've been involved in (I'm in environmental chemistry now, but was formerly in neuroscience). My advisor said that the time involved in getting one of the previous papers published would be worth it. Not surprisingly, my prior advisor agrees because he obviously wants to get that work out.  

At a gut level though, I feel that this is a pretty bad idea, which is why I wanted to get some feedback from the community here. For the past few years, I've thought of the abandoned projects as sunk costs now. Because of the updated work that's been published since then in that subfield, I would definitely have to a re-coding and re-running of simulations. Figures would have to be re-done. There would be a lot of additional literature reading in a domain I'm no longer familiar with and the discussion section of the manuscript would have to be pretty thoroughly re-done. The techniques are similar, but it's still a different field, and I'm thinking I could be better off making my existing projects in my present field better. I regret not putting in a little more extra effort at the time to put the work at least on Arxiv, but my hands were also pretty full with ramping up in a graduate program as a new student. The work as is is not Arxiv-able. 

**The Question(s)**: For the sake of covering all my bases then, is it worth putting in the time and work to get one of those papers across the finish line? As a secondary question, for folks in the sciences, what have your experiences been with abandoned projects? I'd be curious to get more anecdotes to help me make my decision.

My current advisor has my best interests in heart, so I appreciate his input. I just feel like my time could be better spent elsewhere, and even if things have been getting a lot more competitive, I have seen people occasionally still getting post-docs with one or even zero formally published first-author papers (though with multiple submitted). Additionally, for the private sector or government statistician tracks, I feel that taking a research university post-doc could be an opportunity cost and that I may be better served borrowing money from family to continue job applications and self-study if I end up unemployed. A post-doc would help me be in a better position to land government research jobs. 

Clarifying on questions a commenter had in the thread in r/gradschool, I would be getting paid to work on the abandoned projects, but I'm thinking the additional time and energy involved in working on those on top of my existing research commitments and thesis writing may not be worthwhile in light of costs to mental health and interpersonal relationships. However, if I end up unemployed for an extended amount of time after graduating, that would also not be good for career development and life satisfaction. The older projects may not only help with post-doc applications, but for private sector gigs because more industry buzzwords were involved.

In my senior year of my undergrad, I was involved with original research (guided by my advisor) as well as being a Research Assistant for a project he was doing with an academic from a separate institution. (I am going to be as vague as possible for my protection). I was going through a hard time per events in my personal life which was impacting my academic work, and found myself in a very vulnerable position. Eventually, I had to let my advisor in on some of the details of why I wasn't as attentive, and he offered advice to get out of an abusive situation. However, the day I moved into a women's shelter, he called me into his office hours and asked if I wanted to explore the potential of a relationship, as well as making other unprofessional comments. I awkwardly left the office hours and a week later he apologized admitting he was unprofessional and going through a personal crisis, and that wasn't how he felt. Since I didn't have the mental or emotional capacity to deal with this at this time, I desperately needed school to be normal, and I wanted to not give up work that I found valuable (on a societal level) and holding the potential to help my career, I agreed to try to continue working with him and maintain professionalism. He hasn't been inappropriate since, but I have realized working with my counselor that I am in a toxic work environment still due to this situation and it isn't good for my mental health to work on this project anymore. I became very unreliable in getting tasks done for this project, and every time I tried to engage I found myself in an awkward emotional and cognitive snowball about the contradictions and unfairness of the situation I found myself in and the objective of the work as well as how I felt bad about not being able to give my 100% which the interlocutors deserved. I have had advice to let myself just gradually slip away from him since I'm starting at the new institution, but due to not being an attentive research assistant this summer, I feel that leaves me looking bad/unprofessional to the new Chair of my department, putting me starting out on a bad foot. I think the professional thing to do is to let them both know I no longer want to be involved in this project in the future (asking to not be a part of the professional conference presentations, other prep for the reports, etc. here on out). I still do however have a chapter in peer review process for co-authorship in process so I can't fully cut ties. I am also unsure how to go about work I need to finish with my original research, and how much I need to let him in on what I'm doing, include him in the review process, or discuss co-authorship on anything I produce. How do I go about distancing myself by asking to terminate my involvement in the project (e.g. format letter/email/video call (since in person no longer able)) what are examples of things I should/should not say, and do you have any advice for this first gen student who does not know the ropes of academia and is still very early on in her career on how to navigate this situation.

iokeni,valonmtg,t2_hb6xq,[Junior] How to Deal with a Course with an Unreasonable Workload?," I  am an undergraduate in my junior year at a lower-endish state school. This semester I am taking a 4 credit class for my major and the workload  is far greater than any other 4 credit class I have taken in the  department. The professor regularly says that we should always feel like  we are ""drowning"" in work. He also says that even though the course  is 4 credits we are expected to do 6 credits worth of work.

The  class is destroying my mental health. For this class alone I am having  to spend 20+ hours per week on this one class. It causes me to get  behind in my other classes and I am in a constant loop of catching up after every assignment in this class. I  attempted to talk to the professor about getting the due dates for  homework moved to be more reasonable but he got frustrated and simply  said ""the due dates aren't changing and that is the end of the  discussion"".

Typically  in this situation I would do my best to get ahead in my other classes so that I can spend more time on this, but due to Covid-19 my other classes are having the curriculum developed weekly, so there is no way  to get ahead as the next week's curriculum does not exist.

From  my perspective I signed up in good faith for a 4 credit class and as I  have taken 4 credit courses in this department during the spring and  summer semesters (which are accelerated), I felt that I had a reasonable idea of the workload. It  is as if this class assumes you have no other classes or  responsibilities as it is essentially a part time job in terms of hours  of study and work per week. This is also problematic because my college  is mostly non-traditional students (mid-20s average age), and during a  pandemic I feel that the excessive workload is even less reasonable. I  don't expect the class to be free or easy, I just expect it to be  reasonably doable by the department's own guidelines of taking at most 2  courses in the department simultaneously (in addition to other non-department courses) in one semester and estimating  about 3 hours per week of study per credit hour the course is. At those  recommendations this class is likely not possible for most students.

Should  I just withdraw? I really do not want to but I am not sure what else I  can do. Because I am taking 15 credit hours, needing 20 hours per week  for this one class is not sustainable and it is seriously impacting me. Also the professor is not willing to compromise so I don't really  understand what I can do in this situation to make things manageable.",1,2020-09-08 01:23:32,AskAcademia

I am a female student about to enter grad school and I have been working with a particular female faculty member for 2 years now, during my last two years of undergrad. I recently brought up the subject of boundaries with her because there were things we were doing that I felt kind of blurred professional/personal boundaries, and it was starting to be confusing for me as she would always insist that our relationship was purely professional, but to me these aren't professional things to do with a student and it seems more like stuff you'd do with a friend. These things included: 

- Asking me to help her come up with baby names for her unborn child. 
- Texting me about her beef with her dad, how annoying her MIL is sometimes, her mental health issues
- Texting me funny memes from twitter 
- Also texting me during meetings and talks to make jokes about the speaker 
- Inviting me to her family's vacation house for the weekend 
- Telling me that I'm ""like family"" (later said she didn't mean it like that and I misinterpreted her words, although I'm not sure how else you could interpret that) 
- Going to see a movie together over the weekend 
- Inviting me over to her home on a weekend to watch a movie while she is in her pajamas 

These don't include everything that has happened over the past 2 years but they are pretty representative. Like I said I was an undergrad when all of this stuff happened (or had just finished undergrad but not yet in grad school) and taking classes with her. 

Anyway when I brought up boundaries she insisted that this is all normal stuff for profs to do with their students especially when you get to grad school, and that if I thought it wasn't professional I was just misunderstanding things.

The work is going good. However it is very difficult to work with him. The professor is irregular with the weekly meetings, abruptly cancels meetings, or at times even forgets about the meeting. 

I have lost count of the number of times he has cancelled or postponed meetings. Still I will try to paint a picture. We have decided to meet three times a week. But in the past four months there have been weeks if not days that he continuously cancelled meetings. 

I am loosing my mind now. I have ranted, ranted and ranted this to my friends. This is taking a toll on my mental health for which I am already struggling because of other reasons. I have informed him about my other commitments and priorities. But nothing has changed. 

The only reason I am still sticking with the professor is the hope of getting a publication out from the work, because the work has been honest and sincere from my side. Getting a publication will mean a lot for my PhD applications.

1) Current State: I have started a PhD in the university I had my Master's. I am in the beginning of my second year. I am fully-funded for the 4 years. I have one second-author paper in one of our most prestigious conferences (machine learning, NIPS). 

 When I started my PhD, I was working on the sub-field X of Machine Learning, and I formulated a new and important problem and proposed a solution framework in my second paper (submitted). I am passionate about X and want to do research in X for the rest of my life. 

2) Problem: It became clear that my professor sees X as merely a tool. She has a problem in mind which I don't think requires X at all. She pushed me into this project with 2 others (both postdocs). This was a project that has been going on with others, with 0 progress. I don't believe any aspect of this problem. She is pushing the problem very hard on me, and is very attached to it.  


3) Question:   I have discovered there is a PhD thesis offer, and the topic is exactly the problem I have formulated and want to work with, in X. I got goosebumps because parts of the offer description are literally word-by-word parts of my under-review paper. This position comes with salary as well. Should I apply? If yes, how should I break this to my supervisor? One angle to go is: my partner is really suffering in this country as she cannot find a job. It is really taking a toll on her mental health. I can use this. Also, if I let him know I am applying for other positions, yet I don't get in, I reckon the rest of my work here will be very awkward.

fy1rv9,akadeemia,t2_664tlxhw,10-year doctoral candidate with no advisor. Exploring legal options,"  tl;dr: advisor not reviewing work. can’t graduate. looking at legal action against school

Hey all, I’m seeking advice on an issue that has been troubling me for awhile as I’m sure someone out there has experienced this before. Sorry if some of this is vague as I need to keep this anonymous, or in wrong subreddit (maybe r/legaladvice is where I need to go..). 

I finished coursework for a doctoral degree in 2014 at a well-known university. The department has a history of being disorganized and anti-social. A few faculty members have just got up and left the department without warning and international students seem to use the program as a perpetual visa-extender as no one is keeping track of who is in the program. 

My first advisor told me to wait a year for data to be anonymized by staff and later on I found out he lost the data but didn’t tell me about it. I pitched other ideas that didn’t make sense to him but professors at other schools thought they were worth exploring. I took a job since my dissertation was not going anywhere and a couple years went by. For a number of reasons I then switched advisors and quit my job with the intention of devoting all of my time to the dissertation for a year.

The new advisor and I set a goal of graduating in May 2020 and by summer ‘19 he said I was on track, but he wasn’t responsive to e-mails or meetings. Fall ’19 approaches and I am trying to submit the proposal asap but I notice he doesn’t open any of the data files, code, or other materials I submit to him and is unprepared for all of our meetings. I send a very light rough draft to get the go ahead to continue working and I don’t hear back for over two months. I turn around the little feedback I got, resubmit a more substantial draft a few weeks later. More than two months have elapsed and I still have not gotten feedback on the draft. This clearly is not sustainable and has negatively affected my mental health more than I’d like to admit. 

I spoke with the provost office about it and they suggested I find another advisor—I talked with one who said he would be happy to help but later punted back to original advisor.  Admin suggested a professor outside of the department but our research doesn’t line up in any way.  So, I’m stuck, again, and feeling like I should drop out and get on with my life- however, I know I will regret not finishing the degree after all these years.

I haven’t heard back from the provosts office and am now looking at legal options. I have been paying dissertation advisement fees for four years with effectively zero dissertation advisement and feel like I’m a part of some white-collar racket.  I know other students in the program are not happy.

Does anyone know how these things go? …is legal action against the school worth it? I’ve read most settle out of court with NDAs, so I can’t find similarities between cases to judge the probability of success here. I really don’t want to get a lawyer, but I don’t see any other option. Help!

My advisor has consistently been awful to me and treated me like crap this semester. I have two weeks to finish all my work for the paper I need to write for him and I don’t have any of the information I need and I’m running out of time but  struggling to find any motivation. Plz help

I’m in my last semester of my undergrad in physics. I was accepted into my top choice grad program and will be attending in the fall. I’m very excited but in order to make that happen I need to actually finish this degree. 

I have had anxiety and depression all throughout my college career, and I’m doing all I can to treat it. Now, the semester was going really well, I was on top of my studies, my research/capstone project, and I was happy, until the school shut down. Now, I, along with everyone else on this sub I’m sure, has to work from home. I’ve never been able to get work done in my house, I live in a house in the town next to campus with my best friends, she’s the best roommate I could ask for. But we don’t have desks in the house that we rent, as it is very small and there’s literally no room. We work at the dinning table, but the chairs are awful and we ultimately end up distracting each other. She also suffered from multiple mental health issues so neither of us have been in a hood place and have been spiraling. We are also under state-mandated quarantine bc we were with out families out of state over break, and recently moved back into our house. So we can’t go and get anything to help, nor can we go anywhere to study. 

It is now to a point where I have 2 weeks to finish my capstone project. Now I have always struggled with research and computational projects, but it’s the only area of research in the department that interests me (I do astrophysics things) and the professor I work under I have known since my second semester of college and I wanted to work with him. So me and one other student started working with this professor and he was always the Star child. I always struggled and fumbled through and certain things with computers give me severe anxiety. In the past few months I have been slowly overcoming the anxiety around computers and was kind of on pace up until shit hit the fan in March. 

Now bc I can’t work, can’t escape, and am trapped with someone who is even more mentally spirals than I am, I haven’t been able to get anything done. Getting out of bed takes literal hours, the only thing I feel that helps is do my hobbies like cooking and knitting, but that’s not helping me getting a degree. We had a group zoom meeting and my advisor set strict goals for me to reach by Friday (tomorrow) and for the following days. I haven’t been able to do any of it bc I am spiraling so hard. It also doesn’t help that I keep getting the objectives changed so on me by my advisor, constantly being spoken over by my advisor and the other member of the group, and am constantly left out of important emails so I don’t get the information I need. I have absolutely no motivation to do anything and that is in part from my personal state of being at the time which I’m trying to control, but also because I have lost all respect from my advisor over this semester because he has consistently treated me like I’m the scum of the earth. I need to graduate but I literally have no idea what I’m doing or how I’m even supposed to start the process to meet the deadlines. I need advice, support, encouragement, anything.",1,2020-04-10 01:01:48,AskAcademia

Quick context: Got to a good uni, load of bad stuff happened growing up, got through first year then had a breakdown, resat 2nd and then took an external year as was still suicidal/depressed, got through that now with a 2:1 and wondering what to do next.

So now I find myself looking forward to the year ahead with everything looking like it's going to be alright. I'm really excited because I love my subject, I enjoy doing academic work and having a year of service jobs and then covid unemployment has just reminded me how much I want to get back to it again. I've beaten off my mental health stuff, I've been taken off my medication and feel the most complete I have ever done in my entire life. I do feel bad saying that because there's so much terrible stuff going on in the world right now that you can't help but put your own stuff in perspective sometimes.

 Anyway before I go too off track, long and short of it is that I really really want to do a PhD in the future. I know loads of people say how difficult it is and how it makes peoples mental health worse and so on but its always been my dream. I love anthropology so much and I would love to do research and go on to teach and I'm willing to do anything to get there. I do feel though that I'm just feel  I'm already so behind other people my age.

I went to uni a year late (for a separate medical reason) and obviously taking 3 years to take complete my 2nd year has kind of compounded the problem of being behind everyone else and not really being that successful. When I talk to the few people I know who are going on to do postgrad and beyond all of them are so well put together. They've got LinkedIn's with pages of experience, they've been ahead of the game and organized conferences whilst they were still undergrads and just generally seem to be really on top of stuff. I just can't help but feel that I've got a hell of a lot of ground to make up if in a few years time I am trying to sell myself to a good institution and all I've got is an undergrad.

I really want to get more into organising stuff next year, I have some research areas that I'm really interested in and I don't know how COVID is going to affect stuff in the long run but do you guys have any suggestions on stuff to kind of flesh out my academic profile whilst you're still in your undergrad. Also I just to clarify I really don't mean this in the sense that I just want to have a full looking CV. I would genuinely like to know some ways of getting more involved in research and making myself a good academic for the future, even if it does transpire that I can't do a PhD after all I would still like to do something that uses these skills in the future.

Anyways thanks in advance!

Tldr:  
Does having to resit stuff for mental health reasons during your undergrad make you less likely to get onto postgrads?

Unfortunately, I'm suffering from depression and anxiety for a very long time, and during the last 2 months it got really worse and it started affecting my performance; I have trouble even completing the bare minimum amount of work for my courses and my research. I have already canceled one of my weekly meetings with him and dropped one course because I couldn't handle the deadlines and the amount of work required. 

Should I mention to my advisor about my health problem and the fact that I'm seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist?

g2h8rr,wvsidnekeslthroway,t2_5q9xqdzf,Alternate work for someone in religious studies/theology?,"Hello all.

I tried to be sensible. I really did. I thought, “I’ll get a masters in psychology, and open a private practice. I will make good money. I will be happy.” And I’m not saying I wouldn’t, 

but I constantly catch myself doing coursework and thinking about how I wish I could be reading about XYZ religious topic right now. I realized that I have no such drive to read about psychology. On the other hand, I’ve spent (not exaggerating) about 5 days out of the week reading about various religious topics for hours each day, since I was maybe 15? I’m nearly 23 now and it hasn’t slowed down. And it’s honestly often quite stupid stuff to spend my time on, like small details of practices that matter to no one (or certainly no one that I know). I don’t talk to anyone about it because they look at me like I have two heads when I do. It’s pretty alienating. I don’t have any logical reason why I do this, there is no incentive to spending my time on this. I just really care about the subject. Can’t get enough of it. 

(I’m a late student BTW, I’m only just finishing my freshman year. So thankfully I’m not in too deep.) 

So when I was having that thought, it really hit me: I’m setting myself up for a very mediocre work life. And I thought of what I could do in psychology if I had the same lust for knowledge that I have for religious ideas. I don’t know if it’s right for me to go into a field that I like, but care significantly less for, when I have this burning passion right here, waiting to be used. Especially since my job plan involves people’s mental health (I would do my absolute best of course- not trying to imply that I would be negligent or crappy). 

But, of course, the only subject I’m crazy interested in has a horrible job market. So as much as I think I’d enjoy being a professor, I’d like to know what my other options are. 

What else can I do with a religious studies/theology education? I’m not Christian or a man, so I don’t plan on leading a church, unfortunately.",1,2020-04-16 15:38:56,AskAcademia
g23svz,Thisisashhley,t2_2ofia6jf,"Got into one unfunded program, low gpa, would staying in undergrad to do a minor and then reapplying for grad school in a year be a good idea?","Hopefully this makes sense to ask here :)
 I will be speaking with my advisor but the earliest appointment available is in a week so any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated!

I am a Liberal Studies major looking to continue on in academia and study English. I applied to masters programs for this Fall. I only got into one program, and it wasn’t one of my top choices. I still like the program but it has no funding and it is cheaper to do online (because I’m out of state), so I am slightly disappointed to be honest.


My gpa was a lot lower than I would have liked (3.0/4.0) I’m curious if it could be beneficial to stay in undergrad for another year to try and get a research position (I haven’t done any research) and or do a minor to boost my gpa. I could do a minor in English and I’m thinking this would look good on my transcripts as well since I’m trying to get into English programs. It would also possibly allow me to network/get better LORs. I am assuming this could help me get into other programs next round. 

I just don’t know if that’s a waste of time or if this is a good strategy. Is this worth the time and money? My gpa is low due to ADHD and mental health which I am working on. I’m determined to not let it stop me. I feel that could do very well in courses for the minor. 

I want to do a PhD (and hopefully at a top program-UCLA, UC Irvine, etc.) and have heard that where you do your MA can affect where you get in for a PhD; the program I got into is at a small state university and it is online. I just don’t want to do a program and then realize I’m going to have a hard time getting into a more competitive PhD.

My goal is just to help people who struggle with mental illness (primarily depression and anxiety) to lead healthier, happier lives and ideally to assist them in as full of a recovery as possible.

I assume most often it’ll be a combination of all three.

I have completed subpar work in the last year of the work that I've done for this PI (which has been about 3 years) but I know he has high expectations and at this point I know he doesn't expect much of me because I've been struggling with meeting deadlines and working at the level he wants me to. I can admit that and I don't mind that he won't write me a letter - I kind of expected it. It hurts, sure, but I'm going to work through what I can until I graduate and defend next year.

I used to be an academic student in High school averaging 91% throughout my first 2 years with my highly passionate dream job to always to be a big time defense attorney coming from a prestigious school to be successful. However by 3rd year and a horrible misfortune of loosing family very close to me and a new exponentially increasing abusive household on top of taking care of my little brother... I just broke. I just gave up on life and a fell into a deep long depression and started flunking and failing almost all my courses completely ruining my grades on the years where it even mattered. By 4th year I ended up dropping the majority of my university courses in exchange for any class I can obtain an easy credit in just so I can graduate, in the end finished with only 4 U level courses with where I had an average of 68% on my U courses. Even lower when including the rest of Mixed level courses at which point I graduated on a 63% average for my 3rd and 4th year courses, EXCLUDING the dozens of courses I failed on top of that.

For the next 3 years after graduating till now I did nothing but work general jobs and struggle with my depression. Now, despite it being 2020 within the last year, I've improved a ton on my mental health and am doing very well. I am able to say I love my life after wasting so much of it. Now, I wanna continue and move forward after so long and wanted to return to my academic studies. I know its cliche but like I said I always wanted to go somewhere prestigious because I know the school you go to matters quite a lot in the field of law where things are getting even more competitive. Specifically I always wanted something like University of Toronto as, as far as I ever knew it was what I always known to be most prestigious in my area. So my question/advice I'm seeking today is:

How do I go about doing this? After being out of school for so long and leaving my academic career on the terms that I did, I don't even remember/know where to begin. 

Idk how important the undergraduate course I attend is or if it even is important, so I can get a degree and go to law school, that is if I can even get into any good courses with my lack luster grades and failures. Idek.

But if I have to redo high school courses as an adult to increases my average Idc, Ill do it. If I have to go to community college idc I'll do it. Just tell me whats the best option for achieving the academic career I desire. Whatever courses I have to take I'm also intending on taking summer/extra courses to make up for my lost time.

And please, I don't want any lecture about how hard it would be or how much time I've already wasted, competitive nature of my big time goal, or questions of if I'm sure I'm willing to do what it takes and dedicate myself. All I'm asking is if there's a way. And if there is TELL ME HOW TO START and my best options and I'll believe in my perseverance and dedication for the rest.

jlnde4,InductiveLeapfrog,t2_5ug0c82n,Is wanting to postpone a PhD because of the Pandemic proof I shouldn't do it in the first place?,"Thanks for reading! I'd be super grateful on some perspective how my situation sounds to you.

I just finished my Master's and love my research topic. I have a PhD proposal almost ready to submit, a supervisor I like and enjoyed working with before, and the support of other researchers at the same university. Due to my recent Master thesis, I'm even in personal contact with some of the other researchers in the field - partially people I've admired for years. I've worked towards and dreamt of being in this position for a really, really long time (ca 40% of my life so far) - but now,  I feel like I'd be doomed to fail and dissappoint everyone involved if I submitted my PhD proposal and started a PhD now. 

I was recently diagnosed with autism and ADHD, and the past few months have shown me how much I struggle organising different projects at once, without clear deadlines and while working from home. I would be devastated if this continued and led to me having to do a 180 further down the application process where even more people count on me, or worse, my poor organisation skills would lead to me fail a PhD and disappointing the people I look up to. 
I also find online communication  quite difficult - there's rarely any feedback how an email is perceived by the recipient and zoom calls are not that much better. And there's no 'running into people' to quickly chat over or ask for advice on pragmatic/social stuff as in ""so what did X mean when..."". 
And of course, my research area isn't corona-relevant and funding will likely become very sparse pretty soon, test subjects aren't even available during Covid. Given my autistic need for predictability, there's a chance I would spend my PhD time worrying over getting a postdoc position instead of enjoying the privilege of doing the PhD itself. 

There's a good alternative for me - I am rather fortunate to have an opportunity to use the next 3-4 years just learning research methodology (which would guarantee a ""backup"" plan outside academia and allow me to enjoy a PhD without future-worries), getting therapy, taking ADHD self-structuring programs and doing internships in-between. (I know how privileged I am here - sorry if I seem ungrateful).  So, I told my supervisor I would be putting off my PhD application for now so I can spend the Pandemic close to my family and postpone this to a time past corona where I would get more out of the PhD experience itself.
Rationally, I know it's the right choice - I'd have time to learn how to write and prepare myself for a PhD, get therapy and ADHD-self-organisation support, perhaps see if my ADHD can get medicated better and so on.

At the same time, it's heartbreaking seeing this dream sail away when I got so close to reaching it. I know it's objectively the best thing for me and my mental health right now - but I come across all these inspirational quotes a la ""do the thing before you're ready"" and ""don't be the coward taking the safe path"" and it makes we want to puke and scream out of fear I just majorly messed up and ruined my chances of studying the thing I've been fantasizing researching since high school. I worry whether my supervisor thinks that if I feel working from home is reason enough to not pursue this PhD opportunity now, when I have written the entire proposal and was always quite vocal about my hope to do a PhD and was even offered support for the grant application process, then I'm unreliable, flaky, and don't have what it takes to be in academia anyway.

While this study aims to enhance research and clinical considerations for LGBQ young adults and their families, it recognizes that stigmas faced by the trans\* community are unique and should not be coupled with stigmas faced by other minority groups. Therefore this study does not include trans\* individuals. This does not mean that trans\* and LGBQ individuals do not share common stigmas, but this study does not wish to generalize unique lived experiences that require more specialized research for this group.

m5tmx8,PhDAdvicePlease,t2_axhr1guk,How bad can a PhD thesis be?,"Hi, throwaway account. I asked this question on r/gradschool as well but wanted advice from any established academics too.

I have been doing a PhD in the UK for 4 years. I just finished my data collection.

I made a stupid mistake in my lab data, for 1 of my 3 samples I used a slightly different piece of equipment to treat samples. It doesn't invalidate the data but it makes the write up difficult and other than '""I fucked up and now this sample is a bit different and it might have changed the results"" I don't know how to explain it.

Worse yet, this happened a few months ago mid-pandemic and I was so scared of running out of time to complete the work that I didn't tell my supervisors and risk having to repeat. I'm having that conversation this week.

So my question to r/askacademia is: How shitty was/is your PhD data? How dodgy can it be while still getting through the viva? Is there a minimum amount to submit and still be ok?

Honest advice appreciated, but please be kind my mental health is non existant at this point.

kxk965,DystopianAnomaly,t2_13j6f2,My PI makes us present our research every 2-3 weeks. I am bipolar and the stress makes my mood cycle and I end up suicidal. How do I ask for accommodations?,"This is a bit of a long post so bear with me.


I am a second year PhD student in STEM, but I already mastered out of another PhD after my advisor left (at the same institution) and had to transfer departments, so technically this is my fourth year at this university. I am on my third advisor at the moment (first advisor of my PhD) and have been in the group since I started my PhD 1.5 years ago.


I was happy for the first year in the group, I didn't have to present my research updates and I learned a ton. The PI is neither too hands on nor too hands off, which is a sweet spot for me. All was going great. After my first year, I had to join the presentation schedule. Three people have to present weekly, for 30-60 minutes each, and each person has to present every 2-3 weeks. Everyone hates having to present and it's stressful for everyone in the group, but I thought I could handle it if everyone else can. And I was wrong.


The presentations, combined with COVID, made my mental health rapidly deteriorate and I was ultimately diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, which I've apparently had since my late teen years but was doing well for ~2 years before COVID. I just couldn't handle the stress of having to produce new results and present them in such a time frame.


A big part of managing bipolar disorder is charting your moods, and I can now pretty much predict my depressive and hypomanic episodes based on when I'll be presenting. My depressive episodes are severe, and I get very suicidal. I have considered getting myself voluntarily committed multiple times just to get a break from the stress of the presentations and keep myself safe from my suicidal ideation. I just can't handle it. I barely function when depressed and cannot work and end up presenting total crap for 15-20 minutes. My hypomanic episodes are ""great"" in the sense that I work 12 hours a day and produce a ton of results, but I'm medicated now that I know I'm bipolar and I refuse to do this to myself.


I will be registered with the disabled students office very soon which entitles me to some accommodations under the ADA, and presumably I could ask to present less frequently and have fewer simultaneous projects (another issue in this group). How do I ask my advisor for these accommodations without making things awkward? Everyone else hates group meeting but can handle it, and he has refused multiple times to stretch out the time between individual presentations. I don't want my colleagues to hate me for getting special treatment. It's only a few of us and everyone would know I'm disabled when the word gets out that I present on a ""special"" schedule (one of the students has to set up the schedule, not the PI).


I really don't know what to do but I can't leave the group, I don't want to be that guy who never settles on an advisor and I don't know if I can find an opening in my small field. I also NEED to maintain a good relationship with my advisor because of how famous he is if I'd like a future in this field (I also like the guy, despite everything).


Any thoughts? Advice?


tl;dr: I'm bipolar, advisor has us present our research every 2-3 weeks, I can't handle the pressure and my mood cycles. Can presumably ask for a ""special"" schedule under ADA but don't know how to do it without everyone noticing I'm disabled or things getting awkward because I’m getting special treatment.",1,2021-01-15 01:50:23,AskAcademia
kve02d,ConfusedPhDLemur,t2_9rxghbk3,"I am thinking of either changing my PhD project, or returning back home, getting a job and doing a PhD besides it, but I don’t know what to do","Hi all. Sorry for the long post, but I am looking for your advice and opinion. For obvious reasons, I will use a throwaway account.

Currently, I am about four months into my PhD and I am having problems with the topic and the general area of my PhD.

**A little background:**

* My background is a masters in Financial Mathematics with a focus on statistics and probability modelling from a low ranked EU uni in my home country (but the best in my country), but with comparable education to the best EU unis, based on my experience from my exchange year
* The university I am currently at is one of the top EU universities, but it is quite a long distance away from my home country and my girlfriend, family and friends
* The PhD is in a specific topic in operations research (OR)
* I am fully funded (little above the mean wage for the country) from a specific project with quite a narrowly defined topic
* After finishing my PhD, I would like to go and work in the industry (consulting, insurance, (central) banking etc.). Basically, I want to be doing research and development in a private institution, and then progressing in a more managerial role later

As a preface, I love doing research. I loved doing it for my master's thesis and in my student jobs. So this is the reason why I want to do a PhD. Because I think that if I found a topic that would interest me, I could give it my all.

**The problem:**

When I have applied to the program/project, the description was very interesting to me, as it combined my knowledge and interest of probability with a practical area in OR (process scheduling). During the interviews, the project was described to me in some more detail, but it still seemed that it was suitable for me.

But when I accepted and signed the offer and arrived at the university, I got to read the project proposal in full. And what I found was that the project was mostly OR, with probability as a distant afterthought. Also, the more we discuss the direction of the project, the more I get the feeling that my strengths, which were the reason they accepted me, lie in the opposite direction.

I am now having problems working on this topic because even though I try to approach it enthusiastically, my enthusiasm is short-lived. I cannot bring myself to get immersed in it, unlike with my master's thesis, where I loved reading the articles, finding new things and researching them further.

I found out that my interests lie in data and models construction based on that data. Additionally, I found out that, despite my previous thinking, I much more prefer stochastics and statistics, especially combined with finance, than OR. I also think that if I had a topic in these areas, not only would it be easier for me to work on it, I could contribute so much more than I can here.

So now I don’t know what to do. It's not like I don’t want to do a PhD, I do, I just don’t see myself going forward like this. I know it might pass, and everyone is telling me to hang in there, and that it will get better. But it really doesn’t feel like this. I am also worried about not getting a job after my PhD if I persist. This feels especially bad, as I was in high demand before leaving my country. Because of all of my doubts and fears, my mental health isn’t the best, as I am constantly anxious, can’t concentrate and do anything. Additionally, the current Covid situation and physical social isolation aren’t doing me any good either.

If I wasn’t paid from the project, I would have tried to change the field. There are currently two projects opened at the same university, with detailed descriptions which suit my interests perfectly. If they were available when I was applying the first time, I would definitely apply to them first.

**The reason why I feel particularly bad about the whole thing:**

Before I decided to go to my current university, I had several options. I had a guaranteed job in my preferred industry with the possibility of doing my PhD alongside it (which would be quite manageable because of the job’s nature). I also had a PhD offer in the same field, which was funded, but I would earn much less (partly because of the country, partly because of the fact that PhD scholarships are ridiculously low in my country). The reason why I didn’t accept them was that they were at my home university, which, as mentioned, has low rankings. The PhD I would have done there could have been shaped by my interests and would be directly beneficial to the field in the industry I want to go to, unlike the current one.

**My question:**

What would you good people suggest me to do?

1. Try to endure for a few more months and see if the topic grows on me, but forfeiting the opportunity to try and apply to two very suitable projects?
2. Leave the PhD, return to my home country, get a job there in data science or credit risk modelling, and start with the PhD next year. But in this case, I am a PhD dropout, who will get his PhD one year later from a relatively unknown uni.
3. Try to switch the promotors and the project? Besides the funding, I don’t know how this would work, as I am afraid that even suggesting this would cause bad blood between me and all of the involved parties, and that it will ultimately be unsuccessful. If this is the best option, how would one go about this?

In the end, the thing I am additionally scared about is the prospect of not getting a job abroad (still in the EU) if I change the program or uni, as I would either be someone who didn’t commit to a specific topic or someone who has the relevant industry experience and a PhD, but both from a small country in the EU. Granted my PhD would be in STEM, but still.

I guess that my situation is quite specific, but if anybody has any advice or a similar experience, I would be grateful.

**TL;DR:** The topic of my PhD is different than imagined, I have no idea whether to change the promotors and my project, return to my country and do a PhD there or just persevere.

**Ps.** I have to add that both of my promotors are extremely nice, especially one I somewhat knew from before, so there are no real hard feelings from my side about our “misunderstanding“ about the topic.",1,2021-01-11 22:36:57,AskAcademia
m0mywt,possiblegirl,t2_kn4vg,Entry-level non-academic research/writing/education jobs for humanities PhDs with little experience outside academia: do they exist? how should I go about looking for them? what can I do to make myself a more competitive candidate?,"I'm in the final year of a historical musicology PhD at an elite university in the U.S. and am currently looking for jobs. Although I haven't ruled out staying in academia and have applied to some academic jobs that are good fits for me, I am not counting on this and am actively trying to find options in the non-academic market. I've gotten the ""a PhD gives you so many transferable skills!"" and ""you don't have to have all the qualifications to apply for a job!"" spiels many times, and I agree that there are a lot of jobs that I could be great in. But when I actually look at jobs, I feel keenly aware that most of them are looking for candidates who have a lot more directly relevant experience than I do; and so far, despite working with a career counselor and putting a lot of effort into crafting resumes and cover letters that emphasize my transferable skills, I haven't made it to the interview stage of anything I've applied for.

The main sectors I've been looking at/applying in are:

* Research/consulting/analyst jobs at jobs in the education, arts, mental health, and outdoors sectors. (The first two are relevant to my PhD work; the second two are things I'm personally passionate about.)
* Freelance writing and editing jobs
* Academic advising/coaching/counseling jobs (at both university and K-12 levels)
* Teaching at private K-12 schools

The transferable skills I think I can emphasize from my PhD work are:

* Gathering and synthesizing complex information from a variety of sources (dissertation)
* Communicating complex ideas in a clear and compelling way (dissertation/teaching)
* Giving clear and engaging oral presentations (conference presentations/teaching)
* Planning and executing events within a budget for diverse attendees (conference planning, service work at the departmental and graduate school level)
* Writing successful grant applications (research/service work)
* Experience with academic writing/publishing/proofreading 
* Training in critical pedagogy, student assessment, and assignment design; demonstrated record of successful teaching (high student evaluation ratings)
* Mentorship and training experience (training new teaching assistants; working with undergraduates  developing senior thesis projects)
* Relationship-building experience (service work involving collaborations with on- and off-campus organizations)
* Experience independently managing multiple short- and long-term priorities and completing tasks autonomously without external supervision

I also have K-12 experience as a private tutor (full time 2010-2012) and management experience as the manager of a work-exchange program at a yoga studio (part-time 2017-2020).

Areas I don't have (much) experience in that I often see on job postings:

* Quantitative research experience. (I did well in college math/statistics and am confident I could learn this, but I don't have any existing experience with it)
* Experience with social-scientific qualitative research/interviews/surveys. (I've done this for some grad seminar projects, but not for my dissertation work.)
* Portfolio of non-academic published writing. (The closest I have area few public musicology blog posts and CD liner notes written more than 5 years ago. I have some personal writing projects I'd like to work on, so perhaps building a portfolio could be an achievable medium-term goal.)
* SEO optimization knowledge/experience. (Considering taking an online course on this, but not sure how much it would help me without demonstrated experience implementing SEO.)
* Project management experience. (Some of my service work kind of fits this...)
* X years of experience in the relevant career sector....

In the longer term, I could imagine pursuing further education/unpaid volunteer or freelance work/etc to build experience in these areas, but right now I really just need a job. I'm sure the market is especially bad now, but I just don't see many genuinely entry-level positions. I have been trying networking (including writing cold emails to people at organizations I'd be interested in working with); so far I haven't had a lot of luck with that, either, but maybe I just need to keep trying.

If anyone has experience making this transition with a similar set of skills/experience, I'd love to hear about your experience and anything you found helpful. I know it's an incredibly tough market for everyone right now, but I wish I didn't feel so much like I'm wasting my time pouring hours into applying for jobs that realistically I have very low odds of getting.

Hi everyone, I’m writing on behalf of a student group from Croatia that is organizing their 2nd psychology conference. 

I’m wondering if there are any academics interested in participating in our conference. This year we are doing it over zoom and we wanted to include a wide variety of people from different countries. 

The conference basically consists of academics and professionals in the field talking about their interests to students of the university. They talk (for about 40 minutes to an hour) about their research, their work experiences or their general interests and usually theres a good turnout because the lectures provide a different not-so-dry perspective on various subjects. This year we did some research about the interests of our audience and I’ll leave them down below but everyone is pretty much welcome. 

Interests: 
- Social psychology 
- Organizational psychology 
- Clinical psychology (main interests are mental illnesses, psychotherapy, work experiences, relationship between a therapist and client, how to take care of your mental health)
- Forensic psychology (main interest abuse, work experiences) 
- Psychology of personality (mainly interests in the dark tetrad and personality theories) 

The conference will be held at the end of February (19th and 20th) and if anyone is interested (or knows someone who might be) please leave a comment!",1,2021-01-11 23:43:03,AskAcademia

Here's the thing - I feel extremely underconfident in my writing skills and reading other papers only makes it worse. I feel like my scientific writing as well as research skills are pathetic and I constantly remain in doubt of my skills until someone else (mostly my guide) reminds me of my previous work. I cannot help but sink in negativity while writing and it is ruining my draft. How do you guys deal with such a situation?

I make it sound like I'm really busy, but I'm truly not. A lot of the stuff I've listed is hugely spaced out. Weeks go by without half of this stuff occurring.

I don't know if it's because there's this ideological view of what doing a PhD requires, but a lot of the blog posts and online posts I read from others suggests that this is an unbelievably busy period and there are simply not enough hours in the day and people's mental health is at stake because of the hours they put in. And honestly, I just don't feel like that. I find it very easy to walk away from my work (either in the evenings or to take breaks now and then) and I wonder if this is detrimental to my completing a satisfactory thesis.

None of my supervisors seem to have any cause for concern and I have plans ahead of me, so I'm not stuck for anything to do. I just wonder if there's a toxicity to the whole PhD lifestyle which pressures people into thinking they have to work themselves into dust or it's not good enough. Maybe this is an American mindset. Maybe it's because of the subject matter I'm researching (I can do it all online from my own bedroom). I don't know.

Quarantine sucked for many reasons but I honestly feel like it allowed me to get the break I’ve always wanted from my shitty lab and made me realize I didn’t have to keep dealing with their bullshit.

I left the lab in late early august and rotated in a new lab early September. The new lab is in a completely different area of research (within neuroscience) so I have to spend my first year catching up on techniques and literature. While my struggles last year had to do with a toxic lab environment, I am now finding that I am struggling with the fact that I will prolong my time in the program.

I wasn’t doing well during the 1st part of last term due to being in a bad mental health state caused by many issues happening around/to me (family members constantly quarreling, and I can’t move out due to COVID etc.). 

Now I’m cold emailing profs asking if they would be interested in supervising my research for fellowships (I’ll make sure that I’m eligible for those fellowships though). I wonder when and how should I let the profs know that I’m studying part-time. Should I include that in my cold email? I worry that profs won’t even finish reading my emails after seeing that I’m a part-time student… 

As an aside, my last term’s exams were deferred, so I haven’t gotten my final transcripts. This way, I could get away from sending them my transcript for now, and they wouldn’t know that I only have 3 courses last term from reading my transcript… But I do plan sending them my transcript after I got my final grades since that's expected to be included in those emails… Therefore, another option that I’m considering is explaining more about why I’m studying part-time after they find that out (potentially from reading my transcript) and ask me about it?

I also wonder if having my situation (family members quarreling etc.) is an acceptable reason for studying part-time? I’ve heard that mental health problems would be looked down upon in college/graduate applications, is this also the case here? If so, what could I do to reduce its negative impact?

I'm a 2nd year in philosophy at a top Canadian university and I'm on the verge of dropping out to relearn STEM skills and rethink my major. 

I am absolutely in love with philosophy - especially asian philsophy. I've reached a high level of proficiency in Japanese, began learning mandarin and ancient chinese (which is so fun after having learnt Japanese), and since my first year of high school I've loved to read buddhist philosophy, political philosophy and more recently western philosophy (particularly French continental philosophers since it's my primary language). I've done very well in my classes so far, and in my current semester I decided to take the highest level courses (other than honours seminars) that are offered in my uni's undergrad philo department. Problem is, even though I love sitting in class, discussing and writing about philosophy, I feel like university hasn't at all lived up to my expectations. 

I'm in some 4th year classes, but I don't feel challenged or that it's adequately in depth. In my Buddhist philosophy class we are reading really interesting Buddhist texts, but I have been doing that on my own for a while and it seems that in my undergrad we won't reach the niches and nuances I'm interested in. 

I still loving doing it. Discussing is fun, I can talk about my interests in my papers, my profs are inspiring, etc. But I feel like I'm not growing as a person. 

There are large parts of philosophy I still haven't explored, but I have no good reason to expect they will be any different in terms of benefits of studying at uni vs on my own. I think I just much prefer learning at my own pace instead of moving slowly through a reading each week, as pompous as that may sound. 

This has led me to want to drop out and relearn the skills I gave up on in HS when I had bad mental health: math, physics,chem and programming. After a couple semesters diving into those subjects on my own I could re-evaluate my major and move forward form there, even if I simply return to philosophy.

All this would be very different if I could rationally decide to pursue a PhD and become a professor, but even with my niche all the evidence I've seen seems to scream against doing that. I think it could be extremely rewarding, but studying asian philosophy at a top university where I'd have at least a chance of getting a job usually means not having almost any colleagues in my area of interest (according to guides on studying asian philo online). Even if I did find a position as a prof, it's unlikely to be in a location I desire which, somehow, is extremely important to me.

**Tl;Dr** Has anyone switched out of a major they're passionate about/good at because they want more of a challenge and want to develop skill sets they don't yet have? I would love to hear any advice! And sorry if my post came across as pompous - my main issue is having such a specific interest in philosphy/buddhism that I'm unlikely to find what I'm looking for in an undergrad (despite being at the uni with the biggest asian studies department in canada). Not trying to say philosophy is easy!

l3qcl5,WieIsDeDrol,t2_12697xt7,Advice about dealing with a professor,"I am a 3rd year PhD student (not in America). I need to hand in my dissertation after 5 months, so I am working on that. At the same time, I am working on a paper which was part of a research project, supervised by a professor at another university.   
For the entirety of the project I did basically all the work, which I understand (altough often he said he would look at something and then didn't). Since the duration of my scholarship is limited (which I need in order to pay for my living expenses), I cannot spend working on this project forever. So I decided to write down all the results, as a first draft for a paper, and e-mail it to him. For some months he didn't say anything, until I e-mailed him again and then he started going through what I wrote. Since then until now, he comments on parts in the draft, and I change it until he is happy with it. Only this goes very, very slow. 

The topic is in theoretical computer science, where actually most of the papers are really badly written. Contain mistakes and not easy to read. He and I prefer correct and easy to read papers. But for me he takes it to a totally different level. We can spend two weeks on something small. And if there is something he doesn't like, he will not read much further. So even the main proofs, which I wrote, he hasn't even looked at. 

And here I am under an insane amount of pressure, trying to get everything finished for my dissertation, delaying working on some other things because this project is still not done. I told him many times that I wanted it to be done before January, otherwise it would give me many problems.  
Maybe it is all my fault, I cannot write papers well enough so we need a lot of time. But I never had this problem before when writing mathematical texts (but no papers). Other professors were not as strict as him.   
 I am at the point where I cannot handle the stress anymore. When I meet with him I have to force myself not to cry or yell.  I just continue tweaking every detail until he's happy. But my mental health suffers a lot. I don't know what to do. Talk to my supervisor? But I think that because of their culture they will end up sticking up for each other, since I am just a foreign student.",1,2021-01-24 02:20:05,AskAcademia
eoogqf,fakehumanitarianhoe,t2_4xam489u,How do you narrow down your research focus on understudied subjects to produce original work?,"Hey everyone! I know this is mostly a subreddit for postgraduate work, but I'm an undergraduate International Development student, currently working on my dissertation. It's due in April, so I do still have time, but I've been struggling since September to really figure out what my focus is. Due to the nature of my degree, we don't do any of our own first-hand research in the field, so my dissertation has to be secondary literature, unless I devise my own frameworks.

My topic generally is mental health and migration, with a focus on Chinese internal migration, which is regretfully a really understudied topic. I'm super passionate about global health, migration and China studies, although I'm increasingly regretting picking this. It feels as if there's no way to make this *work* at the moment and I'm getting super stressed about it. 

I have a few questions that if anyone's done a secondary data dissertation/thesis, I would be eternally thankful to hear your answers, experience and advice!

1) How did you/would you recommend narrowing down your research focus? I've read so much around the subject it feels all jumbled in my head at this point and I'm scared I'm going to over reach. 

2) If you've done a secondary lit dissertation, how did you manage to actually answer your questions? How did you source your data (i.e. from academic papers, databases?). Did you use multiple data sources, and if so how did you try and bring these together to answer your thesis?

3) If on the off-chance anyone here has focused on sociology of mental health (or similar fields), are there any frameworks/theories you'd recommend looking into? I have found a few (notably social exclusion, social capital, and acculturation hypotheses for migration), but I'd appreciate any additional insights!

Thank you in advance, and (if anyone responds to my niche request!) I look forward to hearing from you.",1,2020-01-14 17:35:30,AskAcademia
kx4wi3,Walk_on_walls,t2_8ltglu3f,I feel completely lost as a senior Researcher / Postdoc.,"Bit of a long post, thanks if you read it all the way through. 

I’m just over the 3-year mark with my postdoc and I feel quite anxious and lost as to what to do next. A bit of a backstory; I finished my PhD in 2017 in molecular microbiology, it was really tough, but I learned a lot and I had great supervisors. I wanted a change of scenery so I moved to Sweden where I would start on a project in more or the less the same field and I knew I would be a great candidate, so I applied. 

After receiving the offer and moving, it became apparent that my new group not only didn’t have any special lab infrastructure prepared but expected me to figure it out on my own. Contrary to what was alluded to in the interview. I was the first person on the project and in comparison, to my PhD workspace, it was completely barren. On the upside, we had plenty of money so it would be financially possible to get the lab fully kitted out, safe and easy to work in as there would be students and other researchers later. 

My initial doubts set in after a month as it was clear that the young guy who was leading the project, was completely hopeless. He had no background knowledge in my field, no real idea of lab setup and no realistic vision or project goals. I don’t mind people not knowing, but when its real moronic ignorance paired with arrogance, I started to get annoyed. I wonder how he got the grant for this work and what sort of bullshit he wrote. I also couldn’t just pack up and leave as I had people dependant on me, and it would mean another difficult move and transition. 

As time went on, it was clear the project wasn’t progressing well. The arrogant moron quit after 7 months and left no plan. So, I got a new project manager who was also completely ignorant to my field but made a substantially greater effort to learn. I did make some good progress in terms of lab building, I designed and created a space with a lot of expensive equipment and safety systems, all on my own. This was great experience, except you can’t publish this sort of work. My new project manager turned out to be totally unsympathetic to the nature of my work and frequently belittled me in front of people and was extremely rude. I got depressed but I pushed on because my lab was basically finished. 

As the month’s past, my mental health deteriorated, and I was always irritable and anxious which affected my personal life. I finally snapped when I couldn’t take any more shit from my new project manager and confronted her. This worked, and she toned down a lot. However, at this point I was already feeling burned out and I noticed that I was constantly on the lookout for new jobs. 

Other bad things included having several of my project ideas either stolen from me or not given acknowledgment. I felt trapped because I had on-going projects that I wanted to publish, and publications equate to your worth in the shitty world of academia. In addition, the contract policy here is very stupid. You start with a small year contract, which “might” be extended by another year or 4-6 months, who knows, so you’re in a constant state of uncertainty. This also messes up an prospects of buying a house and settling down – I haven’t bothered learning Swedish as I always thought I’d leave. 

As of now, my partner of 5 years and I have separated for other reasons, but I think the stress and certainty from work contributed towards that. I feel freer to just quit this place and search for work elsewhere, and I am desperate to leave academia for good. The problem is that I feel I might have overspecialised in my area – and that finding the right place will be a nightmare. I have about 11 months left on my contract, but I am almost tempted to quit tomorrow. I have had enough of academic life, chasing stupid publications, pleasing ungrateful, idiotic bosses and constantly worrying where I’m going to live next. 

I just want to know if anyone else has had similar experiences – or is going through something similar?",1,2021-01-14 12:41:34,AskAcademia

e8gbka,Gemini725,t2_3u2gyd0n,My Letter to the Dept. Chair (Analysis and Insights Welcome)," Here is the letter I wrote to the department chair.  I thought I'd post this to give everyone a better idea of the situation.  I'd like to get people's opinions on whether it seems that they professor was instructed not to interact with me, if I should have been allowed to reconcile with her afterwards etc. However, please abide by the rules of the sub. For example, please keep your comments civil. This includes not telling me to ""get help,"" (that's not an expression of concern or empathy but a way of telling someone they're crazy), attempting to diagnose mental health conditions beyond what I've self-disclosed, and keeping comments civil. (You're welcome to disagree, offer honest opinions, but I will not  tolerate personal attacks.)

\*Consider that these events were fresh at this time and less time had passed since having a class with this professor. (I was still adjusting  to possibly never seeing her again.)

Dear Dr. \_\_\_\_I am writing in regards to some experiences I've had with Dr.\_\_\_.  The first incident was when I met with her on \_\_\_,2018. I had asked her in an email if she would be my graduate advisor and she suggested we meet in person to discuss it. She greeted me warmly, but then snapped  ""What did you want to ask me?"" (It's hard to convey the tone in an email, but I perceived it as ""cold."")  Although a bit taken aback, I  asked her to be my advisor. She then instantaneously regained her composure as she explained why should could not. The rest of the semester went well, and I wrote her a stellar evaluation (overlooking her momentary irritability). 

The next incident was at the end of the semester. I had asked for a one to two day extension on a paper (As you know, I experienced significant stress due to my housing situation last semester.) Although it was granted, she told me that she ""was not pleased"" with having to grant it, and again, her tone turned cold (but warmed up once I submitted the paper). A professor should not express personal dissatisfaction with a student. I received an A- on the paper (and an A in the course), so I want to emphasize that I'm not retaliating against a grade.  About a week later, I wrote her asking if I could contact her in the future for a letter of recommendation to graduate school. Based on her ""lukewarm"" reply (in which she ignored my comment about being inspired by her research and classes), I assumed that I was not going to receive the letter, and this caused me anxiety.

In April, I submitted a proposal to the\_\_\_ Association (which as accepted for presentation at their annual meeting). After having trouble finding volunteers, I recently contacted the\_\_\_\_ Center at \_\_\_ and spoke to someone there (I do not wish to reveal their identity) who suggested that I contact Dr. \_\_\_\_ She  described her as being ""very active in the community and \_Association"" and implied that Dr. would be happy to help. Instead, however, I received a curt reply. The reason was ostensibly that I submitted the proposal before securing narrators. While I can certainly understand her disapproval of such action, I thought her tone was disproportionately harsh.

 Still, I tried to understand her perspective, so I emailed her again offering to withdraw the proposal. Being an amateur at oral history (this was my first attempt), I am not familiar with conference/research protocols, but I certainly understand her not agreeing with my actions. I even described them in the email as being  ""impulsive"" and ""imprudent"" and wanted to at least leave on good terms with her, but she ignored that email altogether.Although I only had two classes with her, I thought highly of her and had expressed my sentiment both to her directly (i.e. telling her how much I admired her work) and to many faculty members (including in my statement of purpose to the M.A. history program at\_\_\_). I. It is one thing to let a student know that you do not approve of their behavior (i.e. regarding the proposal), but it should be done politely and professionally. I would like this situation addressed, and I am hoping to reach an amicable resolution.

g6fm16,postdoc_throwaway3,t2_55qhqxvz,How to deal with a difficult grad student,"Throwaway for obvious reasons, but I need some advice!

I’m a postdoc in STEM doing a short stint in the lab I got my PhD in. Currently looking for jobs outside academia but given the current situation, I’m perfectly content finishing up some work in my stable work environment for the time being. I hope everyone is staying safe!

That being said, I’m in charge of a grad student. Normally, I love mentoring. It was one of my favorite parts of grad school. But this student is on another level, and while I think I’m fairly decent at empathizing with students and getting on their level to mentor them, this one is a black box to me.

This student has multiple mental issues - bipolar, anxiety, insomnia, multiple personality disorder, maybe even more. I admit, I have zero understanding of these things. I don’t have mental health issues, aside from maybe some mild anxiety. I can’t relate to them, and I try to understand that maybe some of their behavior isn’t their own doing. I can’t understand the way their brain works, and maybe that’s why I’m having a problem. 

This student comes across as lazy, arrogant, and apathetic to everything. They want everyone to do their work for them and get irrationally upset with constructive criticism (which is really all grad school is, isn’t it?). They don’t respond to anything, they don’t listen to any advice, and do what they want regardless of the consequences and how much it’s slowing down their progress. Lab work is not the place to reinvent the wheel, and this student acts like it’s their job to do it - and they do it poorly. 
This week we had zoom meetings that this student couldn’t be bothered to attend, which is baloney to me because we’re all working from from home with nothing else to do. All they had to do was turn their computer on and stare at a screen. There are no excuses, in my opinion. Not to mention, they were perfectly able to post on social media later on. This is not new - this student ALWAYS has excuses, and before this quarantine it was truly amazing if they were in lab for more than a few hours a day. I dunno about the rest of you, but when I was a grad student, I considered a 10 hour day a good day. 

That isn’t the point as much as I am at a total loss as to how to handle this student. Their schedule is my advisor’s job. But for me, I’m usually not mean, but this student brings out a side of me I hate, a mean side. A “why aren’t you doing your job” side. I’ve tried being nice, I’ve tried being mean, I’ve tried ignoring them entirely (abundance of talking for hours on end in lab is one of their abilities), and nothing works. Right now, I don’t know how this student is going to make it through the program. And I don’t know how much longer I can handle them.

I apologize for the long post, but I’m about at the end of the rope with them. Remote work has made it more difficult, as I’m afraid I’m better with words than I am in person, so working together has been tough, as this person still manages to make an excuse for everything. 
I need advice, and absolutely any wise words you may have in handling difficult students are SO welcome.

Context I: I am scheduled to transfer to a California State University via an associates for transfer psychology degree with an extra (not pursuing bachelors program) associates for transfer communication degree after the spring 2020 semester.

Context II: I was diagnosed and started treatment for ADHD during April of the Spring 2019 semester. Before treatment, I was basically barely understanding intro to stats and would have probably only passed due to grade inflation or by scrapping by with no real understanding.

Context III: After treatment started, I had a honeymoon period with Adderall where I was able to hyperfocus on Statistics and convert my low B to a low A. I was able to understand and thoroughly work on the rest of the stats chapters 8-13 (confidence intervals, hypothesis testings of various kinds, some ANOVA...). However, I failed a test and scrapped by the first test for chapters 1-7 of intro to stats. At this time I was technically taking just 10 units.

Context IV: Following my successful Spring 2019 semester, I mindlessly decided to take a six week online course for the summer for a class I dropped in the Spring. I got overwhelmed failed spectatcularly (20%) despite conferring with the instructor on a personal TMI level. During the Fall 2019 semester, I had initially tried to take 17 units worth with a pre-cal class that I did not need. I had to drop down to 12 units by dropping precal and I still struggled with my courses because I had focused too much on one course and apparently I still suck at coping with ADHD and being a good college student and adult.

**The Problem: I learned the hard way that being incompetent (or not up to standard of a course prereq wise) with prior material and skills in college level writing, study skills, and algebra in a course that needed those things was not a nice experience. At the state university level, I fear that I might pop into a class that uses stats and find that I really did not retain or grasp enough to make it through. I also have this fear with even the research methods course I am going to take at my CC.**

**I am contemplating taking intro to stats or remedial statistical literacy to enrich and compensate for my time I spent in SP19 Stats where I was un-medicated and did not do well or honest try on the earlier chapters. HOWEVER, doing so would move my credits from 12 units to 16 units. Looking at my courseload of 12 units, there are some reasons why it would be easier than this semester, but I am conflicted on whether or not potential stress and risks of taking 16 units is worth it in order to ready myself for applying statistics in my research methods course and for classes at the CSU.**

**My intro to stats instructor was surprised I did so well on the later and ""harder material"" but he did acknowledge I did not do too well on the earlier chapters. I do not know what to do and I would like some perspectives from those with more experience than me. I am not sure if I can even contact my stats instructor or future research method instructor because it is finals and then winter break....**

***Can/should I rise up to the challenge of 16 units to prevent my fear of being unprepared for CSU level application and learning of stats?***

Self-loathing and hopelessness—caused by an inability to feasibly transfer out—gave way to undiagnosed clinical depression. Even as my social life began to demonstrably improve by the end of my sophomore year, the damage had been done. I began to dip academically. I slept for over 15 hours a day and struggled to even look at my assignments. Eventually, my depression became so debilitating that in the Fall Semester of my Junior Year I had to medically withdraw to (1) retain my academic scholarship as it would’ve been rescinded and (2) to resolve my mental health issues.

It was not easy, but I returned to campus over 9 months later with personal, therapeutic, and medicinal resources that I did not have before. I have not been able to in that time return to the student I was in high school. I had to withdraw from a summer course that I was taking prior to returning to school as I was not yet acclimated to academic life just yet. Furthermore, I still struggle with deadlines and regressing to prior mental states when apparent crises arose.

The reason I prefaced the reception of my English degree with the words “hopefully” was because I am awaiting for a grade to be changed from a Not Finished (for all intents and purposes, an F). Over the course of the summer, I had agreed to do an independent study with a professor to write a senior thesis. A week after work began, I developed scarlet fever that incapacitated me for nearly a month. This set back our timeline considerably and meant that the work had to be completed during my final semester.

What ended up happening was I missed the deadline and completely collapsed. I stopped taking my medication and attending classes, as well as started sleeping 16 hours a day once again. Thankfully, my professor reached out to the Dean’s Office and I was compelled to finally speak with him. We agreed to a timetable and discussed exactly what had to occur for me to get the grade I deserve. I completed the work and he’s happy with it, but I now must wait on my college’s Academic Committee to alter the grade. I have explained the circumstances (including an explanation for why I am before them again since the semester before my withdrawal I had to get another Not Finished changed) to the Academic Committee and have the full support of the Dean’s Office and my professor behind me. Even if the Academic Committee is not compassionate, I will only need to complete one more English course for my degree. I will hear back from them in early January.

I just wanted to ask the people on this subreddit with experience in applying to grad schools, am I too far gone? My transcript is a total mess. I did graduate with a 3.6, but it’s not a 3.6 from Harvard. 

To preface this, before even sending out applications, I plan on taking further time on resolving these lingering mental health issues. 

I just can’t see myself doing anything but teaching English in a college/university. I always had plans of going to a prestigious university. I adore books, I love writing, I enjoy research, etc. Most of all, I’d love to be able to be the same light in another student’s life that the above-mentioned professor has been to me.

What can I do? Can I do anything at all? Any feedback would be wonderful.",1,2019-12-17 15:16:34,AskAcademia

&amp;nbsp;

My personal tutor always mentioned how odd it was that I did better in coursework and the essay part of the exam than I did in the MCQ part. I noticed this myself when I looked at the module breakdowns, which showed other students scored higher in the MCQ than they did in the essay/coursework.  Throughout Level 1 and Semester 1 of Level 2, my coursework and essay marks were higher than my MCQ marks. During the Semester 2 exams I noticed some of the MCQs were formatted in a way which would disadvantage some students. I emailed my personal tutor highlighting this, and gave examples of how they could be made better. My personal tutor responded by telling me I raised some very important points. So given all of this, there clearly is an issue with how the department format MCQs.

&amp;nbsp;
 
In my Semester 2 exams I ran out of time because I was unwell and couldn’t think clearly, it literally felt like I hadn’t taken my meds in months. My semester 2 exam essays were incomplete, which meant I performed worse in the essays compared to the MCQs in the exams. On one morning during the exam period I felt too unwell to attend my exam, so I emailed the Support Officer. I was told to apply for mitigating circumstances, so I did.

 &amp;nbsp;

When I read the mitigating circumstances guidance I noticed there was a list of outcomes, which included alternative assessments and that it was granted by the School (the School’s Pro Dean of Student Education). So when I applied for mitigating circumstances, I ticked the ‘D – other please state’ box and requested an alternative assessment instead of resits. I presumed if an alternative assessment wasn’t going to be granted resits would. If someone asks for mustard instead of ketchup, and you have no mustard, you give them ketchup, not oil.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Level 2 admin sent me the School’s Special Cases Committee letter on the 2nd of July, which didn’t mention the exams. I asked Level 2 admin about the Semester 2 exams I applied for since it was missing from the letter. Level 2 admin told me all the exams were included in the letter. I assumed she may not know, so I asked Support Officer since she was the one I sent the form to.

&amp;nbsp;
 
Support Officer told me I applied for consideration of circumstances, not resits. Support Officer asked me which exams I wanted to sit, so I told her the Semester 2 exams I wanted to sit. Disability tutor started emailing me, and told me I could not get mitigation. Disability tutor then admitted I did have grounds for mitigation from that form, and told me to appeal and ask for resits or consideration of circumstances. So given he told me I couldn’t get mitigation, and then told me to appeal and ask for consideration of circumstances, I thought I was never granted mitigation… why else would he be telling me to request consideration of circumstances?
 
&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I raised the same points about the format of MCQs with Disability tutor, and he kept referring them as “your perceived issues”. I got upset about this, because it was not appropriate for Disability tutor, especially considering he’s a disability tutor, to be referring to issues a disabled student raises in a derogatory way and preventing them from being able to discuss them. I also raised these points with R from Disability Services, but she wouldn’t discuss this with me. I got upset about this, because Disability tutor was stopping me from being able to discuss my points with R. It was only in the first week of August that R let me meet with her to discuss this, after I pointed out that it was unfair decisions were being made without me being allowed to have an input, and without Disability tutor or R even meeting with me (I’d never met R at this point). During that meeting R told me the issues I raised would be a problem, but this was something the School should be taking into consideration when setting exams. Essentially, if I was allowed to have that discussion with Disability Services sooner, and if Disability tutor didn’t use derogatory language in his references to them, I wouldn’t have gotten so upset.
 
&amp;nbsp;

I emailed personal tutor complaining about Disability tutor correspondence with me and how he had been approaching me throughout the year. I mentioned how anxiety provoking it was when he’d sent me passive aggressive emails earlier in the year, and how he kept brining up temporary leave in inappropriate ways. Disability tutor kept bringing up temporary leave during July/August too, after I had complained about him doing this and how he was making me uncomfortable in doing so.
 
&amp;nbsp;

So throughout July and August, not only was I upset thinking I was never granted mitigation (especially because of the tone of the email Disability tutor sent), and having legitimate concerns being disregarded, I was also becoming increasingly upset and frustrated about staff’s refusal to enter me for exams. Support officer had asked me which exams I wanted to sit, so I told her thinking I would be entered for the ones I asked to be entered for. But as she was on holiday Disability tutor had started emailing me instead, and he kept refusing to enter me when I asked, but then I also had disability services telling me I could be sitting twice as many exams since exams were split. So I asked for them to be unsplit because I didn’t want Disability tutor to use that as an excuse to stop me from being entered. I told both Disability tutor and Disability my rationale for asking them to be unsplit – that it would be easier and less stressful than twice as many exams. LUU even told them unsplit would be a better option. So me, LUU and Disability all thought I was going to be entered for exams, and then Disability tutor kept refusing to enter me. Note, this was before I submitted my appeal. So I asked the Deputy Head of School (HoS was on holiday) if I could be entered, she refused. Then I asked the Director of Student Education, and she refused. Note, all the emails I have show staff wanting to offer me resits, asking the disability tutor and then him saying I’m not capable – because hes made incorrect assumptions about me based on a conversation we had over 2 years ago when I was undiagnosed and unmedicated, and included him deciding to incorrectly diagnose me
 
&amp;nbsp;

On the 13th of August I went into the School of Psychology to see if my personal tutor, was available because the situation had distracted and upset me making it difficult to do work. As she wasn’t in her office, I went to the general office to ask if anyone knew if she was available, Support officer and Disability tutor were in there (Two other members of staff were in there too – I think one was XYZ, not sure about the other, but I know they were doing UCAS offers). Support officer said she should be in her office, I said I already checked and she wasn’t there, they asked if I wanted to speak to them instead. I said “no, not really” but I still went with them to another room (XYZ laughed at my joke so I clearly wasn’t being rude when I went in).
 
&amp;nbsp;

I went with Disability tutor and Support officer to another room. I was sitting, they were both standing by the door, they kept giving me excuses despite my being there being to do with trying to get help from my personal tutor to refocus my attention, because I was already upset with what was going on and two members of staff. At one point Disability tutor kept repeatedly saying “but am I right but am I right but am I right but am I right”, and I ended up getting frustrated and calling him a “fucking fascist” because he wouldn’t shut up. Disability tutor asked me to leave, so I did.
 
&amp;nbsp;

I got half way down the steps of the Psychology building and decided I’d had enough of Disability tutor and the situation, and wanted to talk to Head of School. So I went back in (this was less than 5 minutes after being asked to leave), and Head of School, Support officer and Disability tutor were all in the foyer of the Psychology building discussing me. I asked Head of School if I could talk to him, he knew who I was and offered to meet with me an hour later.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I returned an hour later. While waiting Disability tutor left Head of School’s office. During that meeting HoS kept giving me excuses, and I had to correct every single incorrect assumption he had made about me and my ability. After I had to correct him HoS said “I’ll have to check the dates”, implying he was going to enter me, until I mentioned it was already half way through the exam period. I explained to HoS that I needed certain grades in some modules for the course I wanted to do when I graduated, and my only other option would be transferring into third year at another university in September but it would be a difficult given the short period of time. HoS then told me I would be able to resit those exams during or after Level 3, and I would have to compromise with a delayed graduation. He also mentioned how the School “work closely with Trinity” and he may be able to pull a few strings. A few days later I asked for confirmation of this, and I kept being communicated with as though this was allowed, even the School’s response to my first appeal gave no indication that it wasn’t allowed. So given no one made any indication that it wasn’t allowed, and it was the Head of School who told me it was, I believed it was allowed.

&amp;nbsp;
 
After the August resit period I still had 3 pieces of coursework left, but because of all the confusion, distraction and upset already caused by all of the above I hadn’t been able to focus on it. As a result of disabilities I had to restart the work – if I picked up where I left off I would have been making mistakes and getting confused because I struggle to return to things once distracted. So basically, this left me with 1 week to do 3 pieces of coursework. I emailed Support officer the day before to explain the situation (how I had to restart because of disabilities, and the impact this was having on my health since I was having to find time anywhere I could), and she gave me an extra 2 hours. The day of I emailed her again but she was on leave so I had to email Disability tutor. I explained the same thing to him, but he was also on leave so I emailed personal tutor. She contacted DoSE on my behalf, who told me I could have an extra 3 hours, and if I missed this deadline I would get late penalties.
 
&amp;nbsp;

I ended up deciding to take the late penalties since
1. I realised I would get better feedback than what I would have gotten on incomplete coursework, which would have helped improve my grades in Level 3.
2. At the time I thought I could resit those exams during/after Level 3 so I didn’t mind having a few late penalties.
3. I had to cut down on sleeping and eating to do 3 pieces of work in a week, and I needed some time to look after myself, so it was better for me to put my health first
 
*Note: During the week I was finding time where I could, this included having to put off picking up my prescription. I ended up unmedicated for one day (Sunday), and spending that day trying to find a pharmacy which had my medication in stock (it is very difficult to find a pharmacy that has it if you need it the same day… which I needed to be able to do that work, especially given the time of the month – I can actually prove both these things…)

&amp;nbsp;
 
I had the appeal hearing in September 2018. I genuinely believed HoS was going to put me in a better position and I trusted him. During I mentioned how the School included a bunch of irrelevant emails but didn’t include a lot of them. The panel didn’t tell me their decision during the hearing because “a letter would explain it better”. I very vaguely had consideration of circumstances explained to me, but I didn’t understand how it would work to take into consideration and that illness. When I left that meeting Head of Student Cases (HoSC) walked me out and I said “I don’t think they’re on the same page”.

&amp;nbsp;
 
From the Xth of September to the Xth of October I had been emailing DoSE (Director of Student Education and School’s representative during meeting) regarding removing late penalties, or being able to submit the one piece I wasn’t able to do because I wanted feedback. Obviously, I still thought taking Level 2 stuff during/after Level 3 was allowed. Throughout this time, I mentioned how I didn’t think taking it during Level 2 would be an issue, DoSE never told me it wasn’t allowed. Just kept communicating as though it was, and was always avoiding answering questions which would have led to me submitting a second appeal. I emailed personal tutor on the last day about it who said “I think LUUs advice is XXX” (can’t remember the last bit exactly – basically told me to submit an appeal like LUU said – this email wasn’t in the DSAR).


 
On the 10th of October I received the Committee on Applications letter. I got upset because:
1.  The University thought I was offered Semester 2 resits in July for August 2018 when I wasn’t.
2.  The University’s letter used very strong language about how staff had been “exceptionally supportive”, which was not the case at all. Staff were preventing me from having discussions I was entitled to participate in about my disabilities and my degree.
3. I was only offered resits as an external student. I thought I could take resits during Level 3, so I had already enrolled which meant I had used my last year of funding. As a result, I wasn’t able to become an external student – I would have ended up being unable to return in 2019-20 to finish my degree.
4. The University’s letter said I couldn’t take resits during Level 3 “due to the workload this would involve”. This was after I received late penalties having been expected to complete 3 pieces of coursework in one week.
5. I was left with “consideration of circumstances”, which felt like a massive slap in the face. At the time I had no idea I was granted this all along, because I was under the impression I hadn’t been granted it – I was told to appeal and ask for consideration of circumstances.
6. I was left unable to apply for the programme I wanted to do when I graduated and had wasted my time and money trying to be entered for exams.
 
&amp;nbsp;

I emailed HoS and DoSE on the 10th of October asking for a letter saying I was never offered Semester 2 resits for August 2018. I met with DoSE in person on the 11th of October and asked for the letter. They wouldn’t write it. During that meeting I brought up the inappropriate language used by Disability tutor, and when I resent her the email during the meeting and she read it, she changed the subject. When I brought up staff sharing students’ private information she said “this wasn’t that time you started swearing was it?” (in reference to the 13th of August confirming she knew about it). When I mentioned how the School only included those emails in their response to my appeal to make me look bad she said “well they’re not your strongest point”. I asked again for a letter admitting that I was never offered resits, and she refused again. I mentioned how I rescheduled a holiday, had missed out on time with friends, missed out on time with family especially considering during that time there had been an inquest into a family member’s death and how it wasn’t fair that the School lied to the university and I put all that effort in to be entered and they just kept refusing and just got to lie. I was about to cry so I decided to leave, DoSE said “I’m sorry you feel that way” I said “I’m sorry you work with a bunch of liars”. I got upset because I thought it was a reasonable request that the School would help to correct what had been misunderstood.

&amp;nbsp;
 
The letter Student Cases sent with the Committee on Applications outcome had the incorrect date, so I thought I had a week to submit my DVC appeal. I submitted it in less than a week, but then received an email where they corrected this, and was offered to meet with Head of Student Cases. The only reason HoSC met with me was because my Mental Health Advisor (legend) convinced her to, I didn’t put two and two together for a month.
 
&amp;nbsp;

I met with HoS (Head of Student Cases) on the 18th of October, who was encouraging me to appeal to the DVC. She mentioned “it’ll be up to him to decide if there’s any ground for complaint”. I explained how I wasn’t able to become an external student because I didn’t have any funding left. We discussed how letting students resit exams when they had already passed was a University-wide discussion, I said “so no more resits” she said “I didn’t say that”. She knew I would be appealing to ask for resits during/after Level 3, but didn’t tell me it wasn’t permitted within the Uni’s regulations. HoSC told me how she thought I was offered resits but didn’t realise I wasn’t offered resits in July. I also mentioned the swearing incident on the 13th of August and how DoSE had said “this wasn’t that time you started swearing, was it?” and HoSC said “that’s victimisation”.

&amp;nbsp;
 
Anyway, I ended up rewriting my DVC appeal, so I put all the email correspondence in chronological order in PowerPoint. I was going through the appeal file and noticed DoSE had included email correspondence with me. I found the original email and noticed DoSE had cut it off specifically where I asked her to be entered for exams and she refused. I was really angry and upset that DoSE told the University I was offered resits when she clearly knew I wasn’t, and ended up sending some not so great emails to staff in the School. Legend told me to stop so I did.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I submitted a DSAR on the 23rd of October, asking for all emails from staff in the School of Psychology from January 2019 to that day, including permanently deleted emails. I received an email from a member of staff who told me the correct email address to send my DSAR to (can’t remember her name).

&amp;nbsp;
 
On the 30th of October I was sent the case file for my Fitness to Study meeting. I noticed it included an inaccurate attendance record, claiming I hadn’t attended anything, so I emailed Student Cases. I was also questioning why Student Cases wouldn’t sent that case file to my University email address and needed an alternative email. I was becoming increasingly upset and anxious about attending, because I couldn’t trust the School given their track record and how they do things. Even how they included those emails to make me look unfit to study and make me look bad during my appeal. The Fitness to Study meeting was on the 31st of October, and I didn’t end up attending because I knew staff would have tried to make me look unfit to study when I was.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I met with my mental health advisor (legend) on the 1st of November. I was getting really upset because we were discussing how I couldn’t afford to take those resits and how I had kept asking and rescheduled a holiday and so many plans. Legend told me “youre not going to get your resits”. I got really upset for being lied to and misled and because of all the misinformation and miscommunication, and I left. I went to the Psychology department and permanently withdrew on impulse. I went home still angry and sent a shitty email.

&amp;nbsp;
 
The next day (Friday 2nd November) I realised my mistake, and asked HoSC to be reinstated because otherwise I would have been unable to receive a degree. She brought up temporary leave but I got upset because I didn’t trust the School, and wouldn’t have any funding if I did take temporary leave. HoSC got in contact with LUU and got me a better advisor. I emailed and phoned HoS on the 5th of November asking to be reinstated and explained if I didn’t return to finish Level 3 I wouldn’t be able to receive a degree at all as I had no funding left.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I met with the new advisor from LUU on the 7th of November. I was told HoSC was looking to have me be reinstated but she wanted to see good attendance. We also discussed my DVC appeal, and he told me about a student who had previously been allowed to do this.

&amp;nbsp;
 
HoS then told me I didn’t attend any project meetings or lectures. I sent him Uber receipts and FitBit tracking proving I attended. I sent them to HoSC too because I knew she was going to let me continue if I had good attendance.

&amp;nbsp;
 
HoS told me on the Xth of X that I was reinstated as a temporary leaver and I could return in 2019. He told me I could put in a complaint about his decision. I was confident there wasn’t a register and I knew I attended project meetings, so I knew when I submitted that complaint it would be upheld and I could be given free tuition for 2019 to complete my final year.

&amp;nbsp;
 
Around the 20th of November I asked A1 and A2 for an update on my DSAR. A1 replied saying he didn’t receive it, so I forwarded the original email to him again. I didn’t hear back at all.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I realised that I wouldn’t be able to lodge a complaint and return to the School. If the School already treated me in that way as a result of lodging an appeal, they would be worse if I lodged a complaint. I was working full time, trying to find someone to take over my tenancy, trying to figure out how to afford funding, receiving multiple emails/calls/texts from SFE and DSA asking me to repay them for what I had already received when I was already in my overdraft after paying half a years rent out of pocket and rescheduling a holiday, dealing with unexpectedly being put back in a negative environment because of the situation.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I was becoming increasingly upset, frustrated and stressed. I ended up trying to report myself to HoSC for what the School accused me of so I could get a disciplinary hearing and be heard. This was the only way the University would understand that I wasn’t granted mitigation and that I wasn’t offered resits, and the only way the University would realise I did have good attendance and see things from my perspective. She wouldn’t give me a disciplinary so I started sending emails so I would be given one.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I received the School’s response to my second appeal. They took my appeal out of context and tried to accuse me of being in America instead of doing work (I can prove I was in the UK – I literally have to get a medical note every time I leave the country, and I have receipts showing I was traveling using UK public transport). I was beyond upset the School would do this, after they already prevented me from resiting level 2 during/after level 3… I trusted them and then I was left without resits and with additional late penalties because they wouldn’t enter me for resits in July and August.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I received the DVC outcome to my first appeal. It mentioned that Level 2 resits during/after Level 3 was not permitted within the University’s regulations. That was the only time the University communicated it to me. The DVC also blamed me for losing my last year of funding and being unable to receive resits, because I believed what HoS said was true. I also found out HoS found out what he told me wasn’t allowed the next day but instead of telling me, kept communicating as though it was allowed. The DVC also made up a random story about me being offered resits in July 2018 despite my making it clear I never was and the whole timeline not fitting in. 

&amp;nbsp;
 
I submitted my complaint to the OIA in early January 2019, while unwell. I received my DSAR in late January which was only when I found out I was granted mitigation all along (remember, I was told I couldn’t get mitigation and to appeal and ask for consideration)

&amp;nbsp;
 
I submit a complaint to the University while unwell.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I get a letter from Student Cases giving me less notice than they’re supposed to give for my second appeal hearing, but it’s either this or having to wait until October. I have the meeting over Skype, because of technical difficulties LUU didn’t get to be there, but it doesn’t matter because they just don’t listen to me anyway.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I get complaint outcome and I’m crying down the phone not understanding how I could be in a lecture and miss the register in every single one. Then I ask to see the registers, and I receive them all and I’m crying because I don’t understand how I could miss every single one. Then I ask other students and they tell me there was a register, but not while I was a student and multiple registers were handed out in the few lectures were there actually was a register.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I look at the registers the uni sent me again, and realise only some of them are dated. Specifically for the time I was a student. I realise the ones that are dated have ‘logged’ written on them in the same pen – the same person who dated them logged them into the University’s system.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I realise I missed one lecture on the 23rd. Another student remembers two registers being handed out on this date, which would have been for the 16th and 23rd which explains them two registers being in the same colour pen. I have concrete proof I attended those other lectures from audio recordings, fitbit tracking and uber receipts so there is NO WAY there was a register in a single lecture I attended.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I remember how HoS sent HoSC an email from my dissertation supervisor cut off specifically where he admitted that I did attend everything up until my withdrawal.  Just another case of the school omitting information to hide things and cover things up.

&amp;nbsp;
 
HoSC keeps telling me I’m going to get the complaint outcome the next week, and to call if I haven’t gotten it. I’m getting stressed because I cant make plans for my future an this whole thing is putting my life on hold. I’m getting stressed because my stuff is still in Leeds because I couldn’t afford a courier to send it back home until I got that complaint outcome and was reimbursed for wasted rent and wasting my time rescheduling holidays.
 
&amp;nbsp;

University basically lets the same biased DVC make a decision about my complaint and second appeal as the one who already blame me for being lied to and misled by the HoS. Unsurprisingly, he ignores all the evidence showing my claims to be correct and bases his judgement on false claims made by staff (who I literally pointed out have always proven themselves to be reliable by knowingly providing incorrect info on several occasions)

&amp;nbsp;

I submit complaint to OIA. I receive all the minutes of the meetings, and if it wasn’t clear that the University didn’t base their judgement on what staff said before, it’s more than clear now. It’s just overwhelmingly disgusting how much staff have continued to lie and the amount of evidence showing them knowingly doing it, and that the Uni received evidence at the time of complaint which proved them to be lying… and yet here I am still being forced to go back through everything again and again. Because there is no transparency or integrity at Leeds University.",1,2019-12-06 01:51:49,AskAcademia
e8befo,groovypuppies,t2_wkef8,"Looking for some advice on possibly getting two PhDs, or a second MSc before a PhD","First for context, I am a Canadian student. I think maybe grad school is done a bit differently in other countries like the USA. So in Canada it is common to get a masters degree first and then do the PhD.

I will be finishing up my MSc in physics next semester. I've been having some issues with mental health and so I haven't been looking into what I want to do a PhD on and where I want to do it as much I should have. My goal is to get a PhD in (theoretical) physics but I am really hesitant to jump into a PhD without looking into what exactly I want to study. I feel really lost about it at the moment. Also I know some deadlines to apply to schools to start next fall have already happened.

There is another option that feels like the right thing to do. There is a math professor who I have done undergrad summer research with and I have taken a couple math classes with him and he's super great to work with. He studies quantum systems and I think his research is really interesting. So I figured it would be a good idea to do a MSc in math under his supervision before I went on to my PhD. I think it would be an opportunity to learn something new and exciting, even if it didn't directly relate to what I want to do for a PhD. I am in school because I want to learn.

I emailed him about it and we had a meeting, and he strongly thinks I should do my PhD with him. He said I could do a masters with him but he seems far less enthusiastic about that. 

So now I am really confused. I want to do my PhD in physics. I've read that it's not good to do two PhDs. But it also seems like fields where it is at least a bit more common to have two PhDs in are math and physics, so maybe it's ok in this case. I am really worried that if I do decide to do a PhD in math, no one will take me as a PhD student in physics after. If I did the PhD in math and not a PhD in physics, then I don't think I would have a hope in hell of ever being in academia as a physicist. Another problem is that I would be getting all three degrees from the same university if I didn't do a PhD physics after, which I read also negatively affects employability. Third, I am worried about burning out after one PhD and never going on to do the second, then I would be stuck with the PhD that isn't my goal. This third worry might be related to my phenomenally low self esteem lately, so it's hard to tell if I'm being objective about it.

I wanted to do a MSc in math because I thought it would be a really good opportunity that I would enjoy a lot. I thought it would make me a more well-rounded researcher and I could learn a lot of really interesting things, including refining my coding skills. Also it would give me a bit of time to think about what I want to do for my PhD. I think it could also help with my self esteem.

So please let me know what your thoughts are. I know that the decision is up to me to make. But I would appreciate any guidance. Will I hurt my chances of studying theoretical physics if I get a PhD in math? Will it be hard to find a PhD supervisor if I already have one PhD? Writing this all out, I guess I am leaning towards doing the MSc in math, but how would I go about telling the math professor this, when he really thinks the PhD is the right way to go? I am upset to let him down. I know it's my life and I shouldn't let anyone's feelings get in the way, but I am worried it would be hard to study under someone who I might have disappointed. So any advice on how to discuss this with the math professor if I do decide I only want the MSc in math would be appreciated. Any advice or thoughts about what I've typed up here would be appreciated. I feel really lost and confused and I've been crying a lot over the past few days.

eb4g32,miyaav,t2_iofj4lq,Help to answer about possibility of getting involved with academic project as a non-academician that will lead to work in the research/ academic field later?,"I got a master degree in new media/ digital media in 2017 from a university in Turkey, where i wrote a thesis related to smartphone and blind people in a city with inadequate infrastructure (I am indonesian, also where the research took place).

After that, i decided that i wanted to work in turkey first before continuing with academia (bcs i live here with my turkish husband). My plan was to work, building a little network while considering about what kind of doctorate study i really want to do. However i could not get any job offer, somehow contributing to worsen my mental health. 

I started to volunteer physically and online and then, thinking that i wanted to work in a digital media/ child education related research, i applied for unis for another master in child education in UK (bcs i dont have background in education, so getting phd in that area was not even an idea i thought about) and two high-end scholarships (bcs those were the only one i knew). What i had in mind was to join think tank, or any research-based work later on. I got an offer from KCL and Leeds but was rejected by the scholarships). So i did not take the opportunity after failing to find another scholarship.

I still try looking for another unis sometimes but i feel like I don't have anyone to be my referee anymore bcs nobody really knows me professionally/ academically in the recent years, bcs i work alone at home (writing/ translating), and only attend short-term courses unrelated to all these.

Right now, i cannot think of any way to reach academia back (let alone scholarship, even though i also know that i won't be able to pay tuition on my own) to reach my goal of being a researcher and academician. Is there even a possibility for me to get any opportunity as a stepping stone for a work in the research field in the future?

Like i tried to send an offer to volunteer with a study center, it did not get any response (is that a mistake?). I kind of think that maybe i can offer a translation or assisting other things in the beginning. Is that possible? If so, how should i start? Who should i contact? Etc.

Hope to get some serious insight here. Thank you.",1,2019-12-15 20:48:16,AskAcademia
egg9y0,academiclady,t2_umzhl,[UPDATE] How to deal with students coming to me at the end of the semester to tell me they had mental health issues during the semester and would like some leniency in the grading? - Bamboozled edition,"A week ago [I asked for some advice](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/ed17at/how_to_deal_with_students_coming_to_me_at_the_end/) about how to handle the students coming to me at the end of the semester asking for help and leniency with their grades because they had ""mental health"" issues during the semester.

The advice from the sub was clear and sound: sorry, students, unless you have documentation and/or let me know ahead of time that this was an issue, you can't get special treatment retroactively. I felt good about that.

Then one of the students cornered me. They were waiting for me at the end of the final exam. We were alone and they asked to speak to me. They had sent me their final paper over ten days late. Since I take 10% of the grade for every day it's late, it was an automatic zero and they begged me to reconsider and look at the paper and give them some credit. 

They explained they are taking five courses and they need to work because they are from an impoverished background (this much I actually know is true). The student is actually quite talented, but because of many absences and missed assignments, they were just barely passing the class. I knew of this student's background and actually did try to keep an eye out for them, but it didn't help much. I stood my ground and said the paper would not count, they would have to take their D and that was it. It wasn't fair to the other students who also had hard semesters, etc.

However, some things lingered in my mind from the conversation. I thought about it constantly all week. The first thing was what felt like a story of him pulling himself out of poverty by getting himself into this special scholarship program at college. They are a talented student, and I didn't want to feel like I was sabotaging their future. And with all that school work plus a job, I mean, who wouldn't have mental health problems, right?

The second part was that they kept talking about how hard they worked on that paper. This is what really got me. His first paper for the class had been very good, but also so late they didn't get much credit for it. There were several students who handed in no final paper at all and got a zero just like this student, and I started to think, why should someone who worked really hard but was held back by other responsibilities and understandable emotional stress be penalized the same way? I thought that might not be fair after all.

I'd already submitted the final grades, but I prepared the change of grade form with all but the new grade and sat down to read their paper. The first odd thing I notice of this paper that this student had two more weeks than they others to write, was that is was very short - half the length it was supposed to be. Then I started reading. It was bad, but also...familiar. It was almost a carbon copy of a group project paper from earlier in the semester with just one new paragraph added. Plus, this paper included all the mistakes from the first paper that I corrected when I graded it! There I was, on Christmas no less, taking my day to try to save this kids career and I got completely bamboozled!

Needless to say, he got his D. And I will be bringing up this paper with the chair of the department as possible academic misconduct. I'm such an idiot!",1,2019-12-27 20:19:04,AskAcademia
dwsads,throwawayforreason45,t2_50vepo9j,At what point is it worth giving up for your mental health?,"Hi there,  


I have been struggling with this feeling for quite a long time and I can't seem to shrug it of, so I was wondering if you guys could help with the following situation. I tried looking for threads about people being in a similar place, but they are almost always in graduate school so sorry for this post but I couldn't find anything similar for undergrads in a similar place.

I started some 4/5 years ago at a vocational school, in which I found my passion in computer science. Soon I realized that I really wanted to deal with computer science research. Afterwards I spended all my time getting into a good research university so I could do my undergrad there. Currently I'm 22 with a decent amount of debt looking to finish undergrad in 3 or 4 years time although it is highly usual to also do a masters afterwards in my country.  

Getting to this point was really stressful, I worked myself way too hard and gave up a decent career but finally made it. After getting in I completely crashed and due to combination of personal circumstances and sacrifices I had to make and I nearly committed suicide out of depression. I got out of my depression due my personal circumstances improving, but noticed that I have a hard time keeping up with all of the course work for longer periods.  

This has gotten so bad that I sometimes start crying after a little bit of work and being incapable of doing anything else for that entire day. Making me only feel even more stressed.

I love my field and love doing research. It is something that I always work a little bit on during longer breaks of school and my professors did say to me it was interesting (although they had no time to help me working it out further). 

Hence here I am in tears full of self doubt and stress. Wondering if I should take leave early from this path and leaving me be forever be disappointing in myself, or continuing killing myself with stress until I get expelled this year because of not getting the required amount of credit (I already got an extension on this last year due to my circumstances, but I don't believe they are allowed to make another).",1,2019-11-15 15:27:54,AskAcademia

f0ea9m,smitha30,t2_5mfrvrii,"Might master out, need advice","I need advice on what I should do. I am in my first year of my PhD program and I am unbelievably unhappy and unsure if mastering out is the right choice. I don't want time off and would apply for other PhD programs in the fall of my 2nd year if I went this route.  


Summary of my reasons to master out:

1.) The program is completely not what I was expecting. Basically there are no ugrads and I cant recruit my own.. basically I am running all of my projects on my own at an R1 school with those same expectations. This is basically impossible and my advisor makes me feel bad when I don't meet his goals (but I can't run all the participants by myself). I also had to fight and defend myself for wanting/needing an office space--I don't even get a key to the door because they don't want to spend the money making it. The school doesn't like giving things to the program and is more focused on other things (clinical students &amp; sports). On another note, my stipend is incredibly low and is barely enough for me to live on. I knew this coming in, but I was guaranteed summer funding and travel funding from my advisor and upon my first semester was told that I will be getting neither of these.

2.) My advisor was very unsupportive when I lost two grandparents and had to travel home for funerals/being with family. I was extremely close to one of them and it wrecked me when she died and I had to grieve. When it came to then end of the semester and I hadn't met the goals I was told that it was my fault that I didn't meet the expectations. I was told that my advisor understood that I was dealing with a lot but that I need to essentially grieve on my own time and focus on school during set hours. I've also addressed my mental health and it has been blown off numerous times and just told thanks for letting them know.

3.) My advisor started me off with 2 first-year projects and I came in with one I wanted to do. The first one is now being written up for pub and he started out saying I would be 1st author.. that now switched to my advisor taking 1st author. The reasoning being that it was an idea before I came in.. but i was told by my advisor that a previous student got 1st because he did all the work (programming, running participants, analyzing data, writing it up). Now I am in the same position doing all the work and my advisor is taking 1st author. I don't want to address it due to the fact that if I master out.. I need a letter of rec from him.

4.) My advisor isn't focused in the research I want to do.. they were willing to work on it and interested and wanted to get into what I want to do. But since coming here that hasn't been the case. Part of me wants to master out and apply to someone more involved in what I want to do.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Through an ongoing mental health condition, I have seem to lost my enthusiasm for my subject (Physics). In addition to that, I am feeling like my specialization does not contribute to society. I don't see any possible applications of my skillset and I don't know where to start looking.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey r/AskAcademia !

I recently graduated with a [B.Sc](https://B.Sc). in Physics from a European school, and I am currently a visiting grad student at a University at the west coast of the US. While finishing my Bachelor's degree, I started feeling unsatisfied with what I was doing, and frankly started developing a pretty toxic mindset towards physics. I got influenced by brilliant people around me, who were mathematicians - they kept telling me how physicists got it all wrong and how physics is just simplified mathematics. I adapted this mindset (**not proud of that**) and started focusing strongly on pure math in my further studies.

This had a pretty negative effect on me, as I recently realized: I don't enjoy doing physics anymore. I get put off by minor shortcomings (for example, I hated learning QFT, because nobody could give me a clear definition of a path integral. Or I didn't like my class on general Relativity, because we didn't cover the geometry I was interested in). I don't even really care for the underlying physics anymore. This resulted in me not putting in the required work for these classes, even failing some of them. 

I keep telling myself that I will switch my focus to pure math, and I am applying to programs in mathematical physics. That does however open up another problem: Apart from not feeling intellectually unfit for a career in math (I know that's largely due to my mental health, so I am trying to not pay too much attention to it - also I recognize a big chunk of internalized arrogance implying that pure math is in some sense more challenging than other areas of science, which certainly is wrong), I am also struggling to see meaning in working on theoretical foundations of either mathematics or theoretical physics. By meaning, I mean a significant contribution to enhancing the living conditions of our society within a timespan of several decades.

This sense of futility has finally destroyed the last straw I was holding on to - the joy of doing pure math. I have arrived at a point where the only thing that is making me hold onto academia is the memory of how much I enjoyed it just a couple of months ago. I'm certain that my current condition is largely due to my mental health condition (which I won't go into, just know that I am seeking treatment, but am on a long waitlist). I would like however to find a way to reignite my passion for science. I really want to make a difference, and I have received strong encouragement during my bachelor's degree - so I don't think I am entirely unfit. Maybe the best way would be to switch subjects towards a more applied discipline, or to find a way to apply the abstract mathematics I like to the real world.

I hope this makes any sense - I would appreciate help of any sort, may it a link to some self-help resources, articles, organizations, reports of your own experiences. I hope I made my problem clear without whining too much!

f1japv,marblemenow1,t2_14s0t7ve,Asking an Information Science Professor what it's like researching in academia,"To get to the main point of this point, I was wondering how I should address my interest in wanting to ultimately pursue research as a career and working in academia as a professor versus working in the industry as an industry researcher.

I've decided that I wanted to be a researcher as a career with research interests in data science, computational social science, natural language processing, machine learning, ethics, tech for social good, computational media, and accessibility in technology for disabled people just to name a few. 

I found out my research interests through research at Cornell University's Future of Learning Lab after my sophomore year in Summer 2019 and while I liked learning about education technology, I preferred to do more data science research in a broader context, specifically in computational social science at Cornell's Social Dynamics Lab, where I use natural language processing (e.g. topic modeling) to determine the emotional arcs of someone's suicidality before they attempt suicide, die by suicide, or get immediate intervention from either a hotline or emergency services, with Reddit data. 

I thoroughly enjoy computational sociology but I also want to branch out into digital humanities, specifically, analyze current events (e.g. Drug War in the Philippines, Spread of CoronaVirus, Martial Law of Macros) from a computational standpoint and make data visualizations based on the words that were most prevalent in news sources from different countries. For example, I would get local online news media like PhilStar and Inquirer for Filipino news and get reliable news sources for the American perspective on Filipino current events. 

As for accessibility in technology for disabled people, I am especially passionate about making technology more enjoyable for neurodiverse individuals, such as but not limiting to autistic folks and persons with ADHD. I want to make sure that autistic people who are non-speaking can still find effective ways to communicate without having to go through abusive therapy like ABA therapy (i.e. Please Google how autistic people who went through ABA therapy first-hand viewed it.) for example. I also want to make sure that people with ADHD don't feel like they have to rush when having to do timed tasks for job applications as well. I also want to conduct research on diversity in the tech industry and tech-related majors specifically for neurodiverse individuals and come up with effective ways to support them, which I will determine in the far future.

In terms of tech for social good, I want to use artificial intelligence and its subareas for social good, specifically in healthcare, mental health, civic tech, and government-related problems. I haven't thoroughly researched how I would use tech for positive social impact but I'll go into more detail later.",1,2020-02-10 02:08:09,AskAcademia

I started a PhD in 2014 but quit after 2 years and left with my masters because of mental health problems. I’ve been working in industry/ government since then, and I love it but I realized that my true passion is research and I am happiest doing experiments, and want to get back to grad school and apply to PhD programs. I sorely miss being in the lab doing experiments. I’ll be quite a bit older (30-31 when I start) but I’m not too concerned about that, in fact I think my experiences and perspective will help. My scientific skills are better than they were too so I feel ready. However, I’m concerned about the transition to life back in academia, in terms of the lifestyle. Also long term, I’m more inclined to an academic career although most don’t recommend it - I have an open mind for sure but I’ve realised in the 4 years of working in industry that it’s not my thing.

Like the title says: it's that special time every PhD student watches the more advanced students go through, and now it's my turn. I'm technically in a good place, in a lot of ways. I've done great in grad school, by most measurements (fellowships, grades, etc). I have a postdoc lined up. I have one first-author paper in the books. I've got all the data for a paper that I'm writing up now (to the best of my ability). Then I've only got a couple little things left to do for a third - the paper's already outlined. My advisor is incredibly supportive and kind. Personally, I have a really great partner and 2 dogs who I adore.  


The problem is that I've struggled a lot with mental health and executive function issues. I have ADHD, a long history of trauma/anxiety/depression, largely unsupportive family, and a long and winding non-traditional path through my education. Like, I'm trying to write up this paper and just getting out a few words at a time feels like getting blood from a stone. It's all stuff I know intimately. I keep losing hours of time and not knowing what happened, and feeling like I'm going to break down crying. The deadline for submitting this paper is looming terribly close.  


It's not at all helping that I have never been able to maintain an organized/tidy living space or practice good time management no matter how hard I try (which I only recently discovered was undiagnosed ADHD).  Stress exacerbates this, and then it becomes a feed-forward loop. I set aside time to tidy, but realize 3 hours has gone by and all I've done is put away half a load of clean laundry and I start beating myself up. Then day after day the mess keeps piling up, then when I go to write/work and my table is covered in unopened mail and journal articles and takeout packaging and groceries I never put away, and I can't find any socks and and and... I just start to lose my mind and everything is impossible.   


I keep thinking I need someone to help me somehow. At least to get my apartment to a more livable condition so I can stop having that send me over the edge.

I work as a postdoc within one of the top UK universities in my field, we work in a fast paced environment with a lot of industry pressure. I joined about a year ago. To my surprise the line manager was a very different person from the interview. He's very straightforward with his comment, if he thinks something is rubbish he tells you in cruid way even in front of other members of the group.
He is never satisfied about anything and if something isn't exactly how he wanted you to do he gets frustrated.

Last Friday, after he calls in for a meeting out of nowhere, there was some misunderstanding about how to approach a certain task but he quickly went into a meltdown and started shouting and putting blame on me  that I'm not doing enough and running the project correctly and so on.

He's like that with most of the other postdocs especially the newer ones, and this postdoc turned out to be a living hell for me, it affects me a lot when he does that, which i feel it's limit bullying, and makes my imposter syndrome even more harmful to my mental health. Some would say just quit but as a migrants the visa is related to this job and it's hard so far to get a new job even after two interviews.

I want to ask about what people's views on how he reacts and if it is acceptable or should I complain?

Thanks to an internship at another lab, I have helped him forge a close collaboration with another research group, which has led to some of the more junior students also interning there, and multiple active projects where I am the ""bridge"" between all parties.  In some ways he treats me more as a post doc or even junior faculty, and he's asked me to basically advise multiple junior students.  This all sounds great, right?  The problem is...**I no longer have any interest in academia or research.**

This high level of productivity the past ~2 years has seriously impacted my health (mostly mental health) and my loved ones, and even as I've talked to him about ""slowing down the pace a bit"" and maybe not intensively working on something at 10pm on a Saturday over Slack, I'm constantly looking at jobs listings.  My friends who have only a BS (a few an MS) have incredible jobs and at this stage in their lives have built decent wealth, some of them are buying houses, meanwhile I am still a broke student with only a few nice papers to show for it. 

I'm coming towards the end of my 4th year with this semester, but I feel like there's no way I can put in another two.  In my area/with my advisor the dissertation is basically ""staple some publications and submitted papers together"", and though he claims not to have a hard rule about number of pubs, just looking at the students that have graduated, I have more pubs than all but one (the dude who spent 7 years).  So ""research contribution""-wise I feel like I'm ready to finish sometime year 5.

I know the advisor has 100% discretion in when their students graduate, but I've been afraid to bring up these concerns for a bunch of reasons -- not wanting to actually get in the mindset of hunting for a job after years of ""guaranteed-employment"" academia, knowing how much he relies on me right now and maybe not wanting to hear the answer (he's a demanding advisor, but as far as I know not the kind of person to needlessly exploit his students.  Another guy who started the same time as me and is frankly lazy af has done basically no research but the advisor lets him coast).  

How do I broach the subject with him?  I feel like I just have to get out as soon as possible for my mental health's sake, I am increasingly in crisis for not being a ""real adult"" while stuck in this program.",1,2021-03-15 15:24:48,AskAcademia

I am interested in a graduate degree and I do love ecology. However, I am concerned that I cannot handle the workload and the stress. 
I have a pretty severe issue with depression (daily suicidal thoughts and the usual perpetual feeling of despair garbage). Fortunately, this has been improving for the first time in my life and I do not want to loose all the progress I’ve made.

I work with a handful of grad students and I hear a ton of complaints about how stressful the journey is and the occasional story of mental breakdowns.

My bosses are basically dropping this opportunity in my lap and I feel like it would be insane to pass it up. I don’t want to give this a try, fuck up, and loose this solid job and/or harm my relationships with my employers.

I am not concerned about the financial aspect too much. I have money saved that could cover fees and as an employee of the university, my tuition would only be $25 a class. 

The project itself is something I am interested in and the people I work with are pretty great.

Hope this comes thru clear, typed this on a phone while anxiously sitting on the toilet.

epyf41,DoodleCard,t2_176x5h,No more funding and studying abroad. What shall I do?,"Long story short. 

I am doing a PhD in country A, and am currently working at my old University in my home country to use equipment.

I have one supervisor and he is bleeding useless. In a way it is good because I can work whereever I want to work but in a way it is bad because when situations like this come along he doesn't help at all and sets me out to do it myself. 

I have aspergers and suffer from depression. So any change that happens really upsets and knocks me down. 

I was notified that I didn't get the main grant for my study country yesterday. I was fine about it (it's very difficult to get) until I realised that my supervisor didn't have a back up plan. 

Essiantally I run out of money in April. Country A is a very expensive country to live in and I will only be able to afford to live in for about 5 months on my savings. 

My supervisor wants me to look out for other grants, but I feel that will take up time from just writing. As after I finish I will have 5 months worth of spending before my savings are used up in country A. However the student halls kick me out in August. 

I've come here cause I realy don't know what to do. My masters supervisor and friend (who I am still in contact with from my original university) has been super supportive. He suggests that I move back to country A and then fly out to country B every now and then to see my main supervisor. My old university is only a train journy away from home and have said that they can offer me a writing desk. 

For my mental health and everything else I have had to deal with my shitty supervisor I think that this might be the best option. But I'm not suppost to come back to the study country before the end of Feburary due to working. And then I have two months to sort everything out. 

I feel like a failure moving back home. But it might be for the best. And even though I have a few friends in country A I do feel happier and more content in my home country. I'm worrying that it will look bad on my part when applying for other jobs ect.

I just don't know what to do. I was wondering if other people on the subreddit have had similar experiences, or have some insite. 

TLDR: I have run out of money for my studies abroad. I can work from home and fly out to see my supervisor on a bimonthly basis. It might be better for me to do that but I feel like a failure.",1,2020-01-17 09:57:29,AskAcademia

In that time I've got one first author publication (related to my PhD, not my postdoc), one mid-author, and two pre-prints, one of which won't be moving forward. There are three manuscripts that could get submitted this year but submitted isn't published and really I feel completely demoralized by the gaps on my CV. 

The lab (4-6 members) had a rough year with a graduate student who was dealing with a mental illness eventually resulting in a psychotic break and left the lab. It was honestly somewhat traumatic because we all did everything in our power to get this student help but it did nothing. 

My boss is surly and difficult to work with. I'm pretty placid and used to ornery bosses, and I was given a lot of flexibility/leeway as a new mom (I had a baby in my second year) and a husband with a well-managed but chronic health condition, so it was working well for a while but I'm realizing now how much I am being taken advantage of. I work really hard, but have so very little to show for it. I don't know how to apply for grants. My boss keeps telling me I won't get one. I don't know if I should spend my energy in a futile effort applying for grants or futile effort in getting these papers out. I'm so disillusioned with the system. I can't even tell if I like research anymore. I used to enjoy it. I can't remember what I enjoy about it. 

I taught a semester as an adjunct. I always was interested in teaching and thought I would enjoy it because I like working with undergrads and I had enjoyed TAing as a grad student, but I found it challenging and got some pretty harsh evals (I was very pregnant at the time, which didn't help). When I left I remember thinking that I could have done it better but overall it was a good experience. However, looking back I just remember being tired, stressed, and feeling hated by my students. 

I'm thinking industry might be my best way to go, but my field doesn't translate well. I know everyone says that, and I need to rely on my strengths but looking through job postings makes me realize I am mediocre at just about everything.

f0npus,HiiragiFujiwara,t2_29pyahzk,How to Deal With a Former Academic Adviser?,"TL; DR: Former Grad Adviser is unpredictable and became controlling after applying to PhDs.  I'm scared of them and scared for my mental health.

I recently graduated with a Master's degree from a two year program in a humanities field.  During the program I had an adviser who had really high expectations for me and had erratic, unpredictable mood swings.  An example of this is when they chewed me out for not fulfilling their expectations the first semester of my first year.  I had begun my graduate degree right after undergraduate without taking a break in between.  When I was struggling with writing a paper for a required course on a subject that I had little experience working with.  They berated me until I cried then comforted me and tried to relate to me.  I left that meeting feeling soooo confused because I couldn't tell if they were on my side or not.  

My relationship with them improved throughout my two years because I gradually figured out what their expectations for me were and I even ended up opening up to them about very personal things and them with me.  However, I could never feel totally secure because they had a tendency to snap on me passive-aggressively, sometimes over little things. (like the way I addressed professors, small grading discrepancies, etc.)  They were also known to do this to other graduate and undergraduate students so I felt comfort in knowing it wasn't just me.  I excused a lot of their behavior because I was their first grad student advisee and I knew they were being tough because they wanted to make me better.

And they did make be a better scholar and student.  During my program they were very willing to advocate for opportunities for me and went above and beyond to provide training for me.  I am truly grateful for everything this adviser did for me, but I also suffered many long nights of crying and mental breakdowns trying to fulfill their expectations.  I started going to counseling (which they knew about) because of they always had really high expectations for me but did not always give me the tools to fulfill them.  This really exacerbated my anxiety and depression.  To this day I'm still dealing with the consequences.

I decided not to tell them all of this before I graduated last year because I wanted to maintain our good relationship, but when I applied to PhD programs this year and asked them for a letter of recommendation, they became extremely controlling and manipulative.  When they saw my list of schools they questioned my readiness to go, even though, they told me I was ready and encouraged me to apply to PhD last year (when I wasn't ready, didn't want to, and didn't have the time for), then they refused to write me letters of rec. unless I applied to the schools they wanted me to, asked me to apply to schools very last minute, and caused me to inconvenience my other recommenders several times.  They also were unemphatic to (or did not realize?) the stress they put me under.  I need the PhD to eventually advance in my desired career.  

My fear is if I don't get into PhD programs this year, that I'll have to ask them more letters of rec. in the future and I'm afraid the same thing will happen all over again.  I'm also afraid to share the good news I have about a new job in my desired career path with them because I don't know if they'll be supportive or be angry because they assume I'm not going to PhD.  Basically, though I'm indebted to them as an advisee and want to have a good relationship with them, I'm afraid of how much power they still hold over me even after I graduated and feel resentful toward them.

I see in the rules that 'tedious whining about grad school burnout' isn't allowed, but I really need advice on this, or at least a big kick up the arse. 

I am in a PhD program at a highly ranked program in my field. I am fully funded. My field is in the Humanities and not one in which I have many career options if I were to quit now (i.e. not Economics or Psychology or anything remotely useful); I would probably have to go into the pre-tertiary teaching profession in some form or another, which I feel contains the precise elements of academia that I'm trying to get away from. 

I applied for grad school during a very horrible part in my life. My personal life was a mess, and I was dealing with severe mental health issues. I really did not think my decision through properly. At the end of the day, I blundered into this position, but now I am not sure what to do.

Why do I dislike my program? I struggle with the meaning of it all. Why are we answering these niggling, minuscule, frankly useless questions? I struggle with the social isolation of being in a competitive department. I know I should check under my own soles for shit and all that, but the truth is I don't get along with any of the students here. I've tried to make friends outside the department, but I feel like everyone here is too busy or too hostile (this is a really competitive campus). I struggle with the feeling that I am researching things which make other people (my supervisors) happy instead of what I really like. But at the end of the day, frankly, I know that these are just excuses. The truth is that if I wanted to, if I knew what to do, I would be able to take some initiative and find some niche for myself in the discipline and in the department. However, I can't seem to think of anything and I just spend all my time mechanically doing my homework and my readings and working out - I'm a caricature of a well-functioning human being. 

Why am I still here? Academically, I'm doing fine, and the faculty and I get along well. I'm not sure what I would do if I were to quit. I would have to leave the country, since I am a foreigner, and my home country is one where opportunities for people in my specific discipline are even thinner on the ground than they are here. I don't have any careers lined up and I have no money to live on while I sort things out. 

Outwardly, I'm your normal first-year graduate student. I might even seem happy, or well-adjusted, or intelligent. But every day is a slog. I have a psychiatrist and I'm taking concrete steps to function (the aforementioned exercise, healthy eating, medication, sleep, etc) but I'm not sure what more I can do. 

What do I want to do? I don't know, and I know I sound like the world's biggest asshole, but I am just frankly rather overwhelmed by everything, and I am truly desperate for some way to discern what to do here. So I'm asking if anyone had a similar experience in their first term of graduate school, and if this feeling did somehow go away, or if you were able to take any concrete steps to make it go away. I wish this post were more articulate, but it's the best I can do - my wires feel all jumbled. Please help!",1,2019-11-13 02:59:15,AskAcademia
dvfpb0,ChodetteDickens,t2_3hjbozva,Applying for a PhD program at a very prestigious institution with a low GPA. Is it even worth a try?,"I have a very specific situation, and I really don't wish to disclose any of it to admissions (in the off chance someone suggests I allude to any of this in my personal statement. I want to preserve the little dignity I have left).

The situation is: When I started my undergrad, I had been in this country for a little over 3 years. I've always been quite stupid, and struggling with English on top of that didn't help my academic prospects. I went to community college (all I could afford) and eventually transferred to a four year institution within commutable distance from home (Couldn't afford to live on campus). I lived in a very abusive home and worked full time while getting my undergrad (also full time). 15-18 credit per semester (so I could finish fast and get out of that house) + 40 hour work week (so I could pay for college). I was exhausted, dealing with very severe OCD, and just overall struggling to keep up with life. 

Outside of work and class, I volunteered as a research assistant at a lab for a year and a teaching assistant for a class for a semester. I felt did what I could with that I had, but I was absolutely exhausted and my GPA suffered (US 3.5 or so). My mental health declined, I got kicked out of home, lived in my car for a little bit, then in one of my High School teachers' basement for a little bit, took the GRE, did very poorly in the math part (somehow managed to get an excellent verbal score), then quit my job, somehow was offered a higher paying job, applied to the few MS programs I could find that didn't require the GRE, got accepted into the two MS program I applied to, and ended up choosing the one out of state to get away from the abuse. Studied full time, worked part time, volunteered as an RA at a lab part time (lab which eventually gave me a paid position), tried committing suicide a couple times, and finished my MS with an even worse GPA than my Bachelors (albeit with a publication in the works).

After that, I spent the next couple years working in research in my field, and have acquired a lot of research experience and co-authored about 6 or so publications (along with a few more conference posters, etc) relevant to my field. Took the GRE again and did poorly in math again, applied to PhD programs and was rejected, got more research experience, attempted suicide again, first authored a small publication, went to a psychologist who thinks I'm in the autism spectrum, co-authored a poster that was presented at an important conference in my field, then decided to give this PhD application thing another try this year.

Contacted an amazing academic in my field whose work I have admired for years, talked to them, sent them my CV and a few of my research ideas, and they feel like I am a perfect fit for their lab and would be happy to support my application. They explained that (as expected) their support does not guarantee admission, as spots are very competitive. That said, they feel my application is very competitive based on my experience, ideas, and fit. BUT THERE'S ONE THING: They haven't seen my transcripts, and I don't feel like they have any idea how bad they are. I feel like this will just end as a pointless reminder of how much of a failure I am, and that I have no chance of ever even having a shot at getting accepted into a PhD program no matter how much passion I have for this field, no matter how much of a good fit I am for the program, how much experience in the field I have, how many publications I have, etc.

ia8112,16H07,t2_63ct8rqk,Can't get away from the crushing feeling of how toxic academia is :( mainly due to one of my professors?,"**Sorry for the long post, TL;DR at the bottom (but a full read would be massively, massively appreciated).**

I'm starting my first year of grad school in a few weeks, and I expect to complete a PhD within the next 5 or 6 years. I was quite talented at undergrad, did 2 research internships, got 3 publications (one sole author), and was well-liked by my lecturers. However, since my penultimate year of study, I have started to feel as though academia might not be for me, not because I wouldn't rise to the challenge, but because I am simply not prepared to backstab and fight people to get a position.

One of my professors, for example, questions my friendship with my supervisor all of the time. She doesn't get along with him on a personal level, and has berated me the whole time for working with him, despite him being supportive of me, my research, and my mental health and wellbeing. I have come to the realisation that she is not very nice, and just because she's a senior academic, doesn't mean she is right. I mentioned that I may want to leave academia after a PhD, and she called me a 'sellout' and mocked me. She's made me cry (and I never cry) for getting near-perfect grades, but not as high as she would expect because I have to balance my part-time job and I also choose to do ECs so I'm not studying all of the time. But apparently that's not good enough. There are literally hordes of students trying to suck up to her to get onto her flashy research trips and she hand picks her favourites to go. She has verbally offered things to me, but I think she knows I won't accept, and I think this annoys her. She seems to actively encourage division, too. For example, we had a guest speaker fly in last year, and she said she was only going to let certain people come to the dinner. I fought for my friends to attend alongside me (who she picked), and then, for the other spots, rather than picking who replied to the email first, she then just picked the people she liked, further creating divides in the student body. Her little minions then run events and leave out others (even not inviting people to their own graduation celebration), and she's just creating this supremacy that I cannot stand, and no one can see fault with it (except for me and my supervisor).

I would have stayed at my undergrad university, but all of this, coupled with their lack of funding, drove me away. I am going to be studying in a program whose department is ranked number 1 for my field overall, although a bit lower for my actual specialism. I'm going to miss my supervisor terribly but he said he will help me from a distance, and said that I should go where the funding and high rankings are. 

So now I'm about to start grad school, and I'm really depressed. I'm excited to research and take some really interesting classes that I couldn't do during my BA, but I just don't think I can cope with it in the long run. Even chatting to my future classmates on social media makes me realise that maybe, whilst I have the intellect for academia, I don't have the backbone. Does anyone else feel like this? Am I wasting my time doing grad school? I have to reapply for the PhD (starting off on just an MA, so I can get out), but I've wanted to do a PhD since I was young, and I do love my research, but I just can't see myself working in such a toxic environment in the long term.

**TL;DR**: certain academics and fellow students have made me realise that I can't cope with the ruthlessness needed to succeed in academia (or at least, how it seems to be), but I don't want to leave before finishing my PhD. Am I wasting my time? How can I stop feeling like this?",1,2020-08-15 14:13:37,AskAcademia
7zlpxx,TheFifthHuman,,Should I drop out of PhD to pursue a career in concept-art?,"I am a 3rd-year PhD student in Computational Neuroscience. Making art—digital art in particular—is my favorite pastime. Of late, I’ve been thinking of dropping out of PhD and pursuing a career in concept-art: is this a reasonable thing to do, or is it too much of a gamble?

Rather than going on a long ramble about things, I’ll try and list all the conflicting factors at play.

I. RESEARCH 

	⁃ I’m in my late 20’s, and am 2.5 years into my PhD program. Previously I did a Masters in computer science.
	⁃ Largely speaking, I used to like the kind of work that I was doing (which has to deal with developing mathematical models to analyze brain signals). 
	⁃ Of late, I think I’m losing interest: I have trouble focusing on one problem for more than a week; and even when I am working, I feel the urge to take (longish) breaks every hour or so.
	⁃ I have a tendency to get stressed under pressure (e.g. when I’m nearing a deadline). Lately, the stress-levels have increased to the levels that sometimes I cope by completely avoiding the situation (and missing deadlines, losing grades etc.)
	⁃ The general decline of interest has affected my productivity levels: naturally, this has started to affect my relationship with my advisor.

II. MENTAL HEALTH

	⁃ For the past year and a half, I’m under treatment for mild, recurring depression and anxiety-avoidant personality traits. This might be contributing to the troubles mentioned above.
	⁃ I am a little concerned that trying to hang on to the PhD program might further deteriorate my mental health.

III. ART

	⁃ I am fairly good at art but not formally trained in art. Lately, I’ve been trying to self-learn the fundamentals with the help of online-videos and some art textbooks.
	⁃ My interest in art and design dates back to early childhood. In fact, after Bachelors, I seriously considered joining a design-school for Masters: eventually I ended up taking the research/academia route.
	⁃ Sometimes I sketch for hours without a break, which stands in sharp contrast to my terribly short attention span when I’m at work.
	⁃ I’m confident that I can train myself to competent levels in making concept-art and illustrations. However, I have very limited knowledge about the industry at large.
	⁃ For the short-term, I think I’ll be able to find trainee positions, internships and contract work in art and design: however, I don’t know how things will hold up in the longer term.

I’m going to ask my therapist for her suggestion, but I would love to get a general, big-picture perspective as well: which is why this post. All things considered, what do you think would be the best course of action?

hmg04x,earthiscubic,t2_dl19g,Should I re-apply for PhD in order to strive for academia?,"Hi this is actually my first post on Reddit as I really need your advice. I am from Singapore, a small but relatively rich country outside Europe, and has recently graduated from one of the top two universities in UK, studying chemistry. Becoming a professor of some sort has always been what I envisioned my future to be since high school. I used to (and still do, I think) enjoy knowledge, learning about new things, and figure out how things work. Oxbridge life, however, has been very stressful and I felt that I was learning more for survival than for the sake of it in my time there. My grades have also been mediocre as a result and I have gotten consistently 2.1 for the year-end exams. My poor work ethics may have caused it as well, as I used to get by with procrastination and weird working hours before university but that obviously does not work in Oxbridge. It also does not help that we are mostly assessed only based on one exam per year, since I produce quality work (despite procrastination as I uphold a high standard for my work even though they are not graded) but have a hard time developing a schedule to revise the whole year's worth of content.

With my year 3 grades I applied for PhD programmes in top schools like Stanford, Harvard, UC Berkeley, Caltech and the other top school in UK. One reason I applied to these top schools is that I want to do PhD close to my SO who has been getting consistently firsts, so we applied to the same schools and hope for the maximum amount of overlaps. Unfortunately, I was rejected by all of them without interview. The applications were done hastily while juggling year 4 work and to be honest, I also felt seriously unprepared for PhD as well as the application since I have only had prior short summer research experiences, so I was unclear which field I want to go in and what's the research landscape like. I also did not contact all of the US PIs for my applications and did not have funding for PhD when applying. 

Dejected, I resorted to applying for PhD funding from a local research institution which, in my opinion, conduct somewhat subpar research and there is a bond of 4 years of service which means I stray further away from my goal of entering academia. I have previously applied to the institution for undergraduate funding and made it to the final round of interview but did not get it mainly due to the type of research I wanted to do (I was more idealistic back then and prefer fundamental research to applied research, which for a small country like Singapore is not practical). To my surprise, the institute rejected me as well without an interview (although this time I stated that my interest is in synthetic materials). At the same time, I received my grades for my final year exam which is still 2.1 and fell way below my expectation. Admittedly I did not study extremely hard for this exam but as it is open book it saves me a lot of memory work and I thought I did better than previously. This caused me to seriously doubt myself and my abilities. I have seen from this sub how stressful and competitive academia can be. If I can't even get a first-class and be selected for PhD, how can I survive the brutal competition during and after PhD to get into academia?

Sorry for the long read but I just want to give as much background to my situation as possible. My SO has already accepted his offer for the other school - he has a bond with the local institution aforementioned and cannot afford to delay a year and apply again. Right now I have graduated and am at a loss of what to do, should I still consider academia and research as a viable career option? I am not a materialistic person and will be satisfied as long as I have decent food to eat every day and a cosy place to stay in. I am considering whether I should explore other career options but I cannot stand a routine job with too much repetition. At least in research I will be testing stuff out and doing something new everyday. Plus, I do enjoy thinking and I still love science. I just don't know if I will be qualified enough and can withstand the pressure. Four years of Oxbridge has already pushed me to the boundary of having mental health problems. I also do not want to stray too far away from my SO. I treat our relationship very seriously and we are both striving for marriage once our lives are settled. 

So, graduate students, post-docs, and academic staff, what do you think I should do?

If I want to continue aiming for research and academia, I will need to gather more research experiences, as well as get funding. My year four project only lasted for about two terms (4 months) and nowhere near publishable level, though I did submit a project report and had a viva on it. My previous research experiences consist of 3x2 months each, all somewhat related to synthetic materials but in different labs. My parents have already supported me through four years of expensive overseas student Oxbridge education and it will not be possible for us to self-fund any further education.

I may also send emails to ask what exactly caused all of them to turn me down. My grades? My letters of recommendations? My application essays? Although they are unlikely to get any replies. 

Of course I can also apply to less competitive schools and PhD programmes, but I feel that just make my chances of going into academia even slimmer. That also does not resolve the issue of funding - being a non-exceptional international student just make it near impossible to get funding from the school itself. The COVID situation isn't making it any better. Singapore is a very small country and there aren't many funding opportunities for PhD in chemistry besides the institution mentioned. 

If I don't go for a PhD, then my life will be significantly easier. But it kind of makes me feel that all the efforts that I have put in until today have gone to waste, and I don't know if I can find a profession that I will enjoy as much. Still, it is better than dropping out of grad school halfway or leaving academia as a junior academic staff.",1,2020-07-06 20:38:34,AskAcademia

3gw3yk,bdg124,t2_nl9xw,"Undergraduate Transcripts, Mental Health, and Graduate School","Hey Everyone,

I want to pursue a career in academia, but in the last two years while on track on complete a double major undergraduate degree, I began to suffer from acute symptoms of major depressive disorder that made it very difficult to complete assignments. Also during that time, I became romantically involved with a girl who had spent time in a psyche ward for attempted suicide and was suffering from similar symptoms. Our relationship only worsened things. 

So, I began receiving 'I' incompletes in courses, while at the same time explaining the situation professors and making special arrangements to eventually complete the required material to get an actual grade. The 'I' incompletes began to snowball, became too overwhelming, and many turned to Fs after a period of time as per university policy. My GPA plummeted and I was academically dismissed, despite an appeal with a formal psychiatric evaluation. 

My question is: When I think I am healthy and prepared, should I return to my former university and attempt to salvage my transcript by contacting former professors to see if they might be willing to accommodate me further, or apply to a different university and 'start over', taking advantage of the credits that may transfer?

I'm in a different geographic location, so applying to a different university is convenient, but I would also have less credits and have to spend more money. If I went back to my old university, I would have to face the likelihood of my professors telling me that it is too late for them to help me (I actually already know at least one that has said I've waited too long to make up the work) and be left trying to correct a low GPA.

Since I want to work in academia, the state of my transcript has been hugely stressful for me. I have been thinking about pursuing a second undergraduate degree in a STEM science it's something I've been interested in and there seems to be more of a demand for faculty in those subjects. This would also give me more coursework demonstrate my abilities and that I could maintain a great GPA.

Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated.",1,2015-08-13 20:20:22,AskAcademia

7vsn2x,TechnicalPurpose,,"Having some medical issues that are greatly effecting my school work, but not sure what to do.","This is a giant wall of text and I'm so sorry I've rambled so much.

The tl;dr is essentially that I'm an undergrad student and my brain isn't working, possibly due to bad medication choices, and I haven't done much of anything all semester. I'm going to see my doctor next week and an academic adviser ASAP to figure out what's going on and what to do to fix this, but any advice anyone can offer on what I should be doing in the mean time would be so helpful.

I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid, ASD two years ago, and have had pretty bad depression/suicidal tendencies since I was 7. Last year I was experiencing a pretty awful case of burn out that greatly exasperated my mental health issues. I had to withdraw from my classes after a suicide attempt and spent a five months focused on therapy and improving my mental health before going back to school for a few classes in the summer, then back to full time last semester. 

I started taking ADHD medication just after I was diagnosed with ASD and an antidepressant last year just after I left school. I developed some pretty bad anxiety issues in the last two years (I assume this a side effect of the ADHD medication now, but I didn't line up the timing until now) that progressively got worse and led to me having panic attacks a few times a week last semester. They were really negatively impacting my life, so I switched anti-depressants in December after classes ended to something more suitable for anxiety. 

I was home with no work or classes for 3 weeks and figured that would be a good time to help me get in the rhythm of the new medication. My anxiety issues disappeared, which seemed great at first, but over the last week I've realized that I'm much worse off now because I've become incredibly apathetic, distracted, have horrible migraines, and I'm physically and mentally exhausted all the time. I don't know how to describe it, but my brain/mind feels weird. I can't focus my attention enough to do anything productive for more then a few minutes at a time, can barely get myself out of bed to go to class, and haven't been able to focus my attention enough to do much of any school work. I have a bunch of over due assignments that will only take a few hours to do that I've told myself everyday for the last two weeks I'm going to do when I wake up, but I just can't get any motivation to actually do them and procrastinate all day until it's suddenly 3 am.

I'm being an absolutely terrible student, and I know that. I 
 can look at the situation rationally and realize I have to do these things or I'll destroy my future, but I just don't care. It's not even that these assignments are boring and I won't enjoy doing them, they're all things I used to be excited about. I don't understand what's going on with me. This is entirely unlike me, though. I was a great student, on the Deans list every semester except the last one, had great relationships with my professors, have multiple student awards listed on my transcript, was in a few student clubs, and did 10-20 hours of volunteer work before the suicide attempt. I know I was over doing it before, hence the burn out, but now I just sit around, binge netflix all day, browse reddit, and doodle. 

The antidepressant I'm on is known to induce apathy, and I had a similar occurrence with another antidepressant in the same class when I was in high school. My ADHD medication are know to lead to dependency and cause fatigue/confusion like I'm experiencing now if you build up your tolerance, but the anxiety I experience with them greatly out weighs any positive benefits they offer, so I would rather go off them then up the dosage. I might need to detox from the medications I'm on or switch to something else, but with either scenario, I'm likely going to be tired/loopy/ill while detoxing or adapting to new medications. 

Obviously, the first step is to see a doctor to discuss the issues. The soonest I can get in to see my psychiatrist is next week, which really sucks since midterms are next week and I'm probably going to bomb them, but I guess it's a start. I assume I should make an appointment with an academic adviser, which I'll do tomorrow morning when the offices are open, but in the mean time, what else should I be doing? 

Also, I was planning on applying to grad school in two years, but now I think the withdrawals/crap marks last semester/current screw up has entirely destroyed any chances of me getting in. I still have above the GPA requirements and got a pretty high score on the GRE this summer. If I get my mental health in check and turn this around over the next year or two, will schools generally look past this kind of thing? ",1,2018-02-07 01:55:40,AskAcademia

CRISPR/Cas9 can modulate gene expression in plants, humans, and animals based on an RNA-guided mechanism. The CRISPR/Cas9 programmable nucleases are the preferred choices over traditional genome editing technologies, which is attributable to ease in target design, the facility to target multiple sites in one step, and predictable off-target sites. The global markets for CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing were estimated at $1.22 billion in 2017. It is expected to reach $5.3 billion by 2025 growing at a CAGR of 20.19 per cent.   

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/h3vi4mzs2ik21.png

 The technique is being effectively employed in therapeutics development, and research and design tools. Large biotech companies like Millipore Sigma (earlier Sigma Aldrich), Thermo Fisher Scientific, Toolgen, Genecopeia, Horizon Discovery, and Agilent Technologies and pharmaceuticals like Novartis, Vertex, Bayer AG, AstraZeneca, Evolva, Juno Therapeutics, and GE Healthcare have skin in the CRISPR game exploring novel techniques to evolve their drug discovery and development processes. They are forming strategic alliances with crucial CRISPR technology companies like Crispr Therapeutics, Editas Medicine, Caribou Biosciences and Intellia Therapeutics to devise gene-based therapies for various genetic diseases.   

 As the research and development investment in the technology is growing by leaps and bounds, the technology’s potential has been explored in newer areas of animal and disease model development, drug compound and target screening, and agriculture and nutritional health products. The ambidexterity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in locating and altering specific genes is assisting researchers and scientists in understanding diseases using cells and animal models. Cas9 system has helped in achieving significant advancements in drug discovery and precluding genetic as well as cardiovascular diseases in humans. Novel treatments for single-gene disorders such as cystic fibrosis, haemophilia and sickle cell disease are being researched using Cas9 tools. This technique is anticipated to be useful in the prevention and cure of complex conditions, such as cancer, heart disease, mental illness, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.   

 In 2017, the global CRISPR-Cas9 mediated drug discovery and development market are expected to jump to $1,305 million by 2020 and further grow by a CAGR of 23.8 per cent over a period of eight years from 2017 to 2025. The technology has the potential to develop genuinely personalized treatments and therapeutic medicines. The Clinical therapy market is expected to contribute significantly to the overall CRISPR-Cas9 tools market by 2025.   

  CRISPR-Cas9 tools will play a multifarious role in agriculture by enabling the industry in editing crops to make them more nutritious, enhanced taste, disease resistant, and less susceptible to drought. Agriculture and plant breeding application segment is restricted in growth by several potential regulatory requirements and ethical apprehensions. Established agritechs like DowDuPont, Monsanto, Syngenta, and new entrants like Pairwise are also extensively active in the CRISPR landscape. Industrial biotechnology and animal biotechnology together will contribute modestly to the global CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing market   

 Product type-based market segments include editing tools, cell lines, animal models, and plant breeding products. Regional-based market segments include North America, Europe, APAC and the Rest of World (RoW). The North American market has the maximum number of companies dealing with CRISPR-Cas9 products or services. The Chinese government is heavily committed to CRISPR research and has awarded more than 23 million yuan ($3.5 million) to 42 CRISPR projects.

2zr8on,[deleted],,"An Undergrad Looking for Some Advice and Guidance: Grad School, Mental Health Issues, and GPA Anxiety.","Hey all,

Before I can start asking my questions, I should probably give some context regarding my current situation. 
 
I’m a 22-year-old English major on track for graduation (possibly) next fall who has a fairly rocky academic career so far. I’ve been to three schools, a community college and two state universities (NDSU and UCF). I should have graduated last year, but due to taking a year off (2012-2013) and my credits from NDSU not fully transferring to my current school my graduation has been delayed by about a year and a half. 

My current GPA is a strange mess. In community college, I started strong with straight As; as time went on my GPA started to slip heavily due to a few mental health issues (which are, unfortunately, still unmanaged). These issues prompted me to take a year off and try to sort things out, and eventually move to ND and attend college there. I didn’t get better. My GPA continued to slip even further (a 2.7 at that point) and I moved back home to Florida last summer. As of last fall, my major GPA is a 2.9, and my general GPA is a 2.8. I’m on track to hold a similar GPA this semester; I’ll likely break a 3.0, depending on how many Bs instead of B-minuses I get. I really don’t expect As anymore.

When I started working on my English BA, I told myself that I wanted to get into graduate school despite the issues I’ve been dealing with (depression and anxiety, which are managed through… certain self destructive behaviors). Due to this, I’ve put a lot of my self-worth into my grades which is perpetuating the cycle of anxiety and depression that I’ve been dealing with for the past few years. In fact, I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/2q5px2/professors_and_tas_what_do_different_letter/) at the end of the last semester in an effort to calm myself down during a really bad breakdown.

I go through a cycle of highs and lows during each semester, where I’ll start strong, fall off hard, and then come back in an effort to save my grade. *I’ve never not gotten an A on a final paper or exam in any course I’ve taken for my BA* despite getting a majority of Bs and Cs as my final grade. This disconnect between what I know I can do and the results I get at the end of the semester also feeds into the cycle of highs and lows that I experience.

So, now that I’ve properly whined about my life, here are my questions to you:

* As a student who truly wants to get into a graduate school somewhere (at this point I’m not picky -- I know my options are limited), what are my chances? What should I do to maximize my chances of getting in somewhere? 

* What I can do about letters of recommendation? Due to my undergraduate career being fractured between schools, I’ve never had enough time to form a proper relationship with a member of the faculty where I’d feel comfortable asking for something like that.

* I’m a first generation college student, so I’m really figuring a lot of this out as I go. If grad school is off the table, where should I go from here to ensure at least a marginal level of personal success? The realization that real life is quickly coming to bite me in the ass unless I figure something out is causing me to stress out and shut down a lot more often than I used to. Unfortunately, there’s no class that I know of titled “Life After College 101.”

* For anyone who has been in a similar situation regarding mental health and school, how did you handle it? Are there any good coping methods for disconnecting myself from my grades?

Apologies if this post seems mopey and a bit too “woe is me”-ish; that definitely was not my intention. I’m really just looking for some guidance. I know that when it comes to school and my future I have a hard time keeping a level head, and that I tend to become anxious very quickly when I realize I have no idea what I’m doing, which makes trying to figure out a plan on my own really hard to do.

I found a Bachelor in Health Administration program. Which was not what I wanted, but would allow to advance in my  current job and move to other management roles. My first semester was demanding, I passed but not with my normal 80-90 marks more 60-ish.  I then registered for my second semester which started in September, had to change my courses around  because they required approval that I was not granted(should have clued in at that point). Called my advisor and she came up with course I should take and got registered. At the ended of September it was brought to my attention by the program that I had only been doing my senior level course and I was not going to able to pass my current course with out having the basic background courses as I was registered in a heavy research course, four year risk management course , third/four year HR management course. I have currently withdrawn from these course and have started an appeal process with the University. All my professors  seemed dumbfound on how I was able to registrar in these course  expressed that I was wronged and set-up to fail. Registers office view so far  is there is official prerequisite and they required course so they do not see and issue.  Each of my professors have called me to encourage me to stick with this program. As they feel I would do very well if I was set-up in correct course for skill level. 
**Problem**: I want to be an RN, working as a  breastfeed consultant or with children with mental illness. I now have the option to take a distance LPN program. LPN is alright it seems like a good stepping stone to getting what I want. downside is after I finish the two year program I will be making double the LPN starting wage. Most University's where I live no longer offer a bridge program  for LPN to RN but there is still one University that offers it currently. I would enroll in right after my LPN program is complete. Other option is to take a Bachelor in Science majoring in Human studies (4 year) then do the RN post degree. 
I have no clue which is best, thinking LPN program which bother me because having a University degree is important to me . I need to finish something I wasting time and money at this point. I'm losing confidence in my ability to make the smart choice when it comes to my academic's.

**TLDR:** wasted two year of university keep switch programs. can figure out  if I  should enroll in a Bachelor of Science Majoring in Human Studies then take a post nursing degree or should I take LPN college diploma than take a LPN bridge program to get RN.

aknqhn,girlupatree,t2_33n48273,Stress levels for teaching staff,"Apologies for any mistakes - on mobile. 

I’m a professor and I have been in university education for years &amp; years in a humanities discipline. 

In the last few years, I’ve noticed a definite sea change in the unrealistic expectations of students, and their litigiousness has accelerated. I’m exhausted. I can’t keep up with their constant demands and neediness, and feel like unless I award them all 100%, tell them that they’re geniuses whilst also listening to their (often extremely upsetting) stories about how, for example, they were abused as children, and act as counsellor, they will complain about me. In fact, sometimes they do. 

My mental health is seriously deteriorating and there’s no staff support at my current place of work. I’m at the end of the line and really want to leave academia for good, except that I worked myself to the ground to get where I am. I feel like I can’t give up even though I know it’s making me ill. 

The short question after these meandering few paragraphs is how do you deal with the stress that comes from difficult student behaviour and expectation?",1,2019-01-28 14:07:24,AskAcademia
alk2ur,404successnotfound,t2_349wkeed,What if life gets in the way of going further? [Humanities],"I'm just frustrated and crushed right now, extremely demotivated. I'm an undergrad in humanities and I fucking love what I do. I'm very passionate about the field and I'm hoping to get to grad school.

I feel my profs (and academia in general?) are harsh and unrealistic about grades and grad school applications overall. One prof who's a major (*really* big shot) figure in the field says he writes recommendation letters to only students who have taken 400 level courses with him but he teaches 200's only and one 400 every three years. 

Another says he doesn't feel comfortable writing a letter for me because I'm lacking a specific component in the way I perform (he was basically telling me to be narrower and address straightforwardly the readings instead of making connections with other things) and although this is fair enough of a critique I'm upset that he throws my request out the window based on this single aspect. 

My department as a whole accepts applications to their graduate program with GPA's no less than 3.5 on the basis of securing funding (which means if you have 3.4 you're fucked). Another prof said he was reluctant to writing me a letter because he doesn't know me well enough and his opinion of me will depend heavily on my grades (and to my misfortune the first class I took with him I got a C, but thankfully I can retake this class later). 

The fourth prof hasn't answered my email about a follow up for a letter since last summer (he left the department last year).

I'm overwhelmed because I can't do it all and I don't know what to do if I don't achieve my goals. I have a CGPA of 3.06 (3.15 for my program only) and I've had to deal with so much shit during the last three years that I'm discouraged by the fact that there's never enough to at least make me feel reassured that I'll go to a grad school I want (not the unreputable one that leads no where).

How can I be the straight A student when I have to work at least 20 hours a day to barely make ends meet financially, deal with toxic family issues at the same time, and mental health problem from an accident I was involved in at the beginning of my studies (thankfully it got better but it has impacted my academics which I slowly have fixed by retaking courses)?

I've been to conferences (one of them was outside the country), I've organized one too, I've been involved in my field for undergrad journals and in any teaching experience I could get. I think my sample paper is decent too. I was hoping building a little of experience on the side would help my chances, but then the prof I met with today said it just shows passion but nothing substantial enough. 

After leaving the prof's office I ran into a 50 year old friend who's doing the graduate program at the department and he was talking about how he doesn't need another degree and this is not that important to him. All I could think about is that he's a lucky bastard and I wish I was in his shoes instead. I know plenty of people at my university who got 3.7+ GPA's because they could go at their own rhythm and didn't have to work part-time on the side. All the time I just think other people are fucking lucky, even the profs. I just want to be in their shoes, in front of a classroom and teach because what they do is so amazing.

People say a graduate program is much harder than an undergrad but to me they forget the most crucial point which is that in undergrad you're not paid to write papers and be at the library. You have to deal with studying *and* work *and* other problems going on in your life. I wanna know how you guys dealt with this.

GPA GPA GPA GPA is all I hear from profs and my academic advisor. Yes it matters and I understand that. But how the fuck am I supposed to get A's when my life isn't peaches and cream and requires me to devote my time to a lot of bullshit on the side?

I'll stop here. I guess I needed to vent as well.",1,2019-01-31 01:17:52,AskAcademia
9wrqkc,zmcsays,t2_q9tr9,[UK] Considering a PhD but looking for some input,"Hi everyone! I know this is a decision that is ultimately up to me but I was hoping for some input from people who've made this choice beforehand etc.

I just got my dissertation feedback for my MA and I'm really pleased with it - got a distinction (so a distinction overall too) and both first and second reader have encouraged me to continue to doctoral study. 

This is something I've wanted to do on and off since I was in high school, but I'd stopped thinking I was good enough for it when I got a 2.1 instead of a 1st at undergrad. Now it seems in reach again, but I still have a lot of reservations. I'm worried about job prospects (another three or four years study for potentially not having a well-paid career after) and the mental health drain in particular, but also not really knowing how to know which course is best, when to begin planning etc, how to find funding and so on.

I would do this in a couple of years at the earliest, maybe around 2022? I need some time to do other stuff first I think - is that leaving it too late to get back into academia? I don't want to lose my skills etc. 

I know this was all ramble-y and if anyone has maintained interest this far, thanks very much! Is a PhD worth it? It's what I've wanted for years but I don't want to make the 'wrong' choice.

9y4nau,petticoattails,t2_2i7cw571,Can you change your methodology in the field if you aren't getting support?,"I am in a quandary and would really appreciate advice!

I had applied for a PhD scholarship with an amazing supervisor and took up the offer. The funding stipulated I had to be attached to one of my supervisor's projects. While the topic didn't necessarily appeal to me, I was buoyed by the thought of working in a team with great academics.
Initially, my supervisor and I had settled on a mini-ethnography in the developing world country that the project was located in. I had reservations because I do not speak the local language and knew this country to have very patriarchal structure that makes it difficult for women to be mobile. Tbh, my parents are from this country, but I'm American, born and raised abroad. 
In spite of being attached to a project, I discovered I would have to arrange everything on my own. I found a rural NGO that said I could come and they would help arrange a stay for me. However, since I've been here, it's been very difficult to get data. Since I cannot speak the local language, I've had to engage a translator. This translator is actually a young girl 'on loan' to me from another NGO and since she can't speak English, we communicate in one of the national languages (which I speak very brokenly). She's fine as a companion, but since I'm doing research in schools, I've been asking the NGO if I can use one of their employees who speaks English to interview parents and teachers, whom I want to ask deep questions. I've repeatedly stressed that I'm willing to pay for the translator and a driver out of my savings. I usually take the buses to the rural school (it takes 1.5 hours to get there) but haven't been able to stay longer than noon, as the girl's parents want her back before dark (understandably). This means I haven't been able to interview parents, who return home in the evenings. Without a driver and a reliable translator, I feel quite crippled in what I can do. The NGO also wants me to do quantitative data analysis for them, even though I'm a qualitative researcher. 

I'm sorry this is long! Basically, I want to change my methodology from an ethnography to interviews with children, parents, and teachers + observations of lessons and return home in 3 months instead of 6. This is because it's a real struggle for me to get data, and I lack the resources I need. Is it okay to change like this based on my experience? I believe my supervisor will support me, but I'm worried over the quality of the data I will get. I'm also very isolated where I am and am currently struggling with both mental and physical health issues.

a0tq99,Veryfastsloth,t2_117ypx,Postgrad mental health workshop,"Hi all, 

I’m in the process of trying to start up a mental health workshop for postgrads at my university (as there is currently very little support). The idea is that postgrads are often the first to notice and be in a position to respond to a mental health problem in their fellow students- so I want to equip them with the skills in how to support them (as well as covering what they can do for themselves). To make sure I cover everything, what kind of problems do you guys see or experience? Do you feel you know how to access help for yourself or for others? Is there anything that, if you were attending this kind of workshop, you feel should be discussed? 

I appreciate that most of you will have already gone past your postgrad studies, and may have students now- in which case anything you can add from that point of view (issues you see, possible solutions) would be great. Also anything that works really well at your university would also be amazing to hear!

So I started a new position at a university just over a month ago (I know, it’s early days)
I’m teaching part time, and doing my PhD part time.
I moved to a new city to do this, away from all of my friends and family, and so far feel massively disillusioned with the whole process.

The department is not really in my field of expertise, but there are adaptable elements which I thought would make it okay. But it seems like a totally different world within which I feel both misunderstood and honestly just not at all smart/up to it.
As well as this, during my first supervisory meeting I was told that the man I signed up to work with will now actually be retiring before the next academic year...

I’ve never taught before and have terrible anxiety about that starting next term and feel that I’ve been given too much responsibility for someone of my position.
And on top of it all I haven’t made a single friend down here. I feel like my mental health is already beginning to suffer.

My mind keeps flitting between:
1) Staying and trying my best (though it’s 4 years and with an as yet unknown new supervisor as of next year)
2) Looking into transferring (unsure of UK university policies on this)
3) Just calling it quits before I’m too far in?

a1f12u,throawaythestresspls,t2_zqc16e,academic integrity violation advice please,"Hey everyone, I had an academic integrity violation and would appreciate any help. I've tried speaking to my academic counsellors but they haven't been too helpful in the matter.  


So last year, I had some accommodations and extensions for my exams because I was very physically ill and had severe depression and anxiety. I had to extend the deferrals I got because my physical and mental health worsened and I was bedridden. I had to get a note from a doctor confirming this and I did. However, when I got home I realised that my doctor didn't properly acknowledge the dates I told her I was sick and wrote an incorrect date. I had a lot of anxiety with leaving my room and speaking to people at the time, so I made the dumb mistake of altering the doctor's note to the correct date myself. So after my faculty office noticed this altercation, I was booked with academic integrity violation. They were sympathetic with my circumstances, but wanted to enforce punishments for the serious offence I committed.  


While I appealed the decision to fail me in 3 of these mandatory courses, I still received sanctions on these courses. The outcome of this appeal would be for me to write these exams, but I would need a certain mark on the exam to pass the course and my grade would be capped for the courses. The whole appeal process for this took around a year, so understandably I forgot a lot about the course content and it became apparent to me that it would be extremely difficulty for me to successfully pass these exams. I had to keep rearranging exam rewrite times with my professors because of my mental health getting worse and some personal circumstances, and my professors were very understanding. If I were to fail any of these courses, I would be required to withdrawal from my program due to the academic regulations of my school.   


I've spoke to some advisers at my school about how my mental health is getting worse and I don't see myself being able to successfully write the deferred exams this semester and they told me it is not possible for me to drop these courses without academic penalty because the academic integrity panel thought they were very lenient already with my decision. For me, the best outcome would be if I were allowed to retake these courses entirely, as I'm someone who needs to be engaged in the class to learn rather than self-study for the final exam for these courses. The ombudsman recommended I propose to the counsel if I could re-enrol in these courses, but the sanctions would still be held. I'm likely going to propose this to the academic integrity panel, but there is still doubt in which if I will be able to get this request approved.  


I also did some reflection about the severity of the sanctions I got. I wanted to know from people in academia if they saw my punishment as just. I saw my actions as an action of weakness, and the panel acknowledged I had no malicious intent; but a stupid mistake. While this is an extreme example, I get extremely upset when I think of how students with criminal charges in crimes like sexual assault are allowed to finish their degree with no sanctions but I am sanctioned for a mistake that was largely rooted with my mental and physical illnesses. It will also be extremely difficult for me to pursue the jobs I want and enrol in grad school, as the grades for these courses are capped at a C for me.   


I was wondering if there are any alternatives to what I plan on proposing to the panel - which is re-enrolling in the courses with the same sanctions...I was wondering if I could convince them to drop the sanctions that would penalise my grades...Any insight or opinions would be appreciated.",1,2018-11-29 06:53:10,AskAcademia

a1zlv2,LongjumpingCrab,t2_2p7ml3iu,Research as a non-traditional CC student; Questions about getting into grad school,"I'm a student in my late 20's who has completed a bachelor's degree and I am currently attending a community college so that I can change careers. My hope is to get into a graduate program, although I am far from having the details hashed out as of now. 

As is the nature of community colleges, this school does not support much research, but there are several tenured professors here who actively involve themselves with research outside of the school. I learned recently that one of my professors (who I will be taking for an extremely important class next semester) is beginning research on a topic that is of great interest of me. I expressed this interest to her and asked if I could do anything to help. Not only did she say yes, but she said that if she could find enough for me to do she may be able to add my name to her paper.

I apologize for my ignorance (academia is unfamiliar territory for me), but I have a few questions--

1) What does ""adding my name"" imply? What impact would that have on me compared to if I did research with her and wasn't listed on her paper? I certainly plan on working as hard as I can on whatever tasks she gives me and I am hoping that I can be as involved as possible (given my limited background), but I know that publishing is a big deal in academia so I'd like to know if having my name listed makes a difference. 

2) What should I expect to be asked to do, and how should I prepare? For what it's worth, data analysis is at the core of the project and a large portion of the grunt-work involved is within the area of expertise of my new field of study. That being said, the research also requires knowledge of a domain that I have not studied formally but is somewhat closely related to my original field of study and my professional background. As far as I'm aware, I will not be expected to do much regarding work within that domain, but I hope to read up on it over winter break. My professor herself is not an expert in that field, but she has found a collaborator who will provide the expertise needed in that subject. Will reading up on this serve me well? I already have a decent amount of knowledge in this area, but I would like a deeper understanding of it. Even though I won't actually be doing any work within that subject area, am I smart by studying it in my free time?

3) As I mentioned earlier, I hope to get accepted into a graduate program. Will taking my prerequisites at a community college hurt me? Unfortunately, my school has a very bad reputation, and that reputation is not unwarranted. However, I have gone out of my way to take professors that maintain high standards and I feel that the education I have received here has been great. As sad as it is, the nature of my school is such that professors have to fight quite hard against an administration that does not support academic rigor, and I have no doubt that the universities I will be applying to (all local) know this. My GPA in my first degree was between a 3.5 and 3.6, but I suffered through severe medical and mental health issues throughout, so it is scattered with F's. One of those F's is in a basic course that covers material in the subject I hope to get a master's in. I failed because life happened and I was too stupid to take a medical withdrawal-- the grade has nothing to do with lack of comprehension; I did not attend the second half of the semester and did not complete the work and had so much going on in my life that dropping the course wasn't what I was thinking about at the time. By the time I apply to grad school I will have taken a higher level course and will have presumably done well in it, but I worry my undergrad GPA will hurt me. However, as of now I have taken 24 credits at community college, all of which are classes that typically have very high fail rates. I have a 4.0 and have received the highest grade in the class in all but one of these classes (and the professor of the one I didn't receive the highest grade in went out of her way to offer to write me a recommendation). I'm worried the 4.0 won't mean much coming from a school with a bad reputation, despite the fact that I feel confident I could do just as well at most schools. How much does school reputation and ""old"" GPA play into grad admissions decisions?

The reason I worry so much about grad school admissions is that I will need to stay local for grad school, and although there are a plethora of universities in my area, there are only two with programs I'm interested in and after doing some research, I found out that one of the schools I'm interested in is a top 20 school that is very well-regarded in the field I would be applying to study and do research in. The other school is one that I am more familiar with, but I am less interested in the program they offer. I can only assume that it would be very challenging for me to get into the top-20 grad program given my non-traditional background, but I'd like to find a way to become competitive, if possible. Do people with my sort of history ever get accepted into top 20-programs? Any advice on what I can do to improve my chances?

9klmth,Moontide,t2_6jkol,"My former P.I/Thesis Advisor went nuclear against the whole lab, me included. Advice appreciated","Tl/dr: I can't get a rec. letter from my thesis advisor because we do not see eye to eye anymore and I don't think it is my fault that this has happened.

Roughly two years ago I joined a bioinformatics lab for my Masters, my P.I. back then was an amazing mentor, she was patient, insightful and rewarded independent thinking and proactiveness. We published four papers together and went to a few conferences, so I was pretty damn sure that I would get a good recommendation letter (especially since I was also a T.A. for her class, extra-officially).

Last year we had some drama happening in the lab, a postdoc was basically just playing computer games in lab all day and leeching off the graduate students' work, the P.I. got (understandably) mad at the whole lab and fired the dude. After that she was never really the same and got progressively worse month after month, starting to verbally abuse her students in front of the whole lab and stopped relegating the good projects to us (she would just work on them herself and publish alone or with her collaborators).

During this time I was in an internship in my dream university in the US so I thought it was just a transient thing, but as soon as I got back and told her of my desires to pursue a PhD in the US she completely ""disowned"" me, going so far as removing me from the lab communication group since I were ""already with a foot out"", in her own words. This happened a few months before my thesis defense, which she went out of her way to make as complicated to schedule as possible.

I am not going to ask her for a recommendation letter, as I have no idea if she will actually write about what we accomplished or if she will sabotage me. I know this potentially looks bad for my application as she was my thesis advisor, but is there any way I can communicate her descent into spitefulness (obviously not with those words) without making it sound like excuses? I'm pretty sure she was struggling with mental health issues and a lot of stress, and that she also probably felt betrayed for trusting so much in her students and having them stab her in the back, but it seems unfair that I should get penalized for those things.

What related fields could be a good choice for me?,"Since I was a child the only career I was ever 100% interested in was medicine but I didn't go into because I'm going blind. I was afraid my sight would worsen enough it'd be hard to practice. Now I'm almost 30 and unsatisfied that my disability has held me back, silly as that sounds. I'd always pictured myself with an advanced degree doing intensive work, not just coasting a long in a comfortable job. 

I currently work as a special education teacher. I have an undergrad degree in literature and grad degree in education. It's an interesting enough field but ultimately I'm not completely satisfied with it. I enjoy helping others and interacting with some small aspects of healthcare/medicine such as genetic conditions and other disabilities. Overall though it's not very fulfilling on a professional and personal level. 

I'd love to switch to something medically related but am unsure what would be good choices. First, because my undergrad was in humanities so I'd have to probably take science prereqs for any intensive science grad degree and I can't afford lots of classes out of pocket. Second, because I'm unsure what careers would still be viable even once I have profound vision loss. 

Topics I've always been interested in include mental health, psychology, and neuroscience. I'd also be interested in healthcare careers that are hands on, if it's even possible to do so with worsening vision. 

If anyone is in a healthcare related discipline I would love some insight into possible careers or programs. Thanks so much! ",1,2018-10-05 19:32:24,AskAcademia

b3szf2,yeetyoinkyote,t2_2b03dz4j,Problems with a course required for my degree,"Okay, this is going to be kind of long, so I apologize. I’m a STEM major, and am enrolled in an upper level computer class. I’m starting to look into grad school. I have been struggling a ton with mental health issues since the beginning of this academic year and it has taken a toll on my work. I still do well, but due to how much of a flaming dumpster fire this one class is (barely a syllabus, extremely old professor, only one form of assessment, too much work for any one to be able to complete, etc.) I am so overwhelmed and have fallen behind severely. I am considering dropping the class, and taking a W (withdrawal) on my transcript and retake the course next year, since it is a required course. Maybe things will turn around and I can get a good grade, maybe I will get a D or an F. I can’t tell right now. 

I spoke to my professor about this matter, and explained that I have documentation for mental health issues and that I’m concerned, and wanted his advice on how to proceed. Not only did he not give me any advice on how to move forward, but he completely invalidated my circumstance and said I’m “not trying as hard as [I]  could.” I left having a panic attack. And now today in class he offered help to everyone except me. I don’t know what to do. 

I don’t want to drop it and retake it next spring, especially since my schedule will be no easier then, and it will be the same Professor teaching the course. But I’m so far behind and I have no idea what to do, and am doing. My work load *might* lighten up in a couple weeks so there is a chance I will be able to catch up, but I can’t tell rn. I’m planning on talking to my advisor and another professor who I work under and trust, as well with some of the  administrators that work with documentation and accommodations. I just don’t know im regards to grad school how Ws looks versus a low grade.

TLDR: I’m having a bad time with health issues and an way far behind in a class required for my major. The professor was totally unhelpful and made the situation worse when I spoke with him regarding the possibility of me dropping the class. I don’t want to screw mused over for grad school by having a W on my transcript, but don’t know if a D or F would look worse.

ahyib6,glossier9,t2_2l3oqns4,Overwhelmed by pure mathematics PhD applications,"I am an italian student, and I have a Bachelor's and a Master's degree (I graduated in december) in pure mathematics from a rather good Milan university. 

Here's my background. My final Bachelor's degree grade was neither excellent nor terrible. Average, I would say. This was mainly due to the fact that the first two years were incredibly though and the selection was fierce. The few of us who did graduate didn't have stellar grades (apart from the 1/2 math geniuses).                           
Everything changed with my Master's degree: I got the highest grade in every exam on the first try, and I graduated with the highest grade with a thesis in operator theory. Not bragging: I am extremely proud of my accomplishment and I truly think that I did an incredible job :)) I have very low self-esteem and believed for the longest time that something like this was simply beyond my abilities.

I realised that I really want to pursue a PhD in pure mathematics (functional analysis and operator theory in particular).  I spoke with my thesis supervisor and he encouraged me. He gave me one name of a professor who is willing to work with me but who unfortunately doesn't have available funding. 

So, now here I am frantically googling and writing emails and browsing universities sites. The whole application process is really draining me and making me anxious. Everytime I spend more than two hours looking for PhDs or potential supervisors I start to feel waves of anxiety and discouragement and overwhelming. 

* I guess that my biggest insecurity is my Bachelor's degree. I know my Master's is excellent but I keep thinking about my Bachelor's and beating myself up about it. I imagine professors looking at my CV and thinking ""yikes"". I would love to hear from someone who was in a similar situation (that is, not academically excellent but got into a PhD program). Also: should I cover the reason my Bachelor's was not excellent in my cover letter?
* What are my chances of actually finding a PhD by emailing potential supervisors out of the blue and then applying by mentioning their names? How many supervisors I should email/applications I should submit? 
* I should also mention that, since PhDs start in autumn and I didn't want to waste 9 months just waiting for one, I just started a full-time job at a consultancy firm. I am very anxious about this because I am afraid it will take precious time from my PhD quest. Everyone around me, however, made me realise that spending all day every day looking for a PhD probably isn't a good idea and that it would seriously compromise my mental health. So now I look for PhDs on nights and weekends. I am still very anxious about this though.

Thank you if you made it this far! I would love to hear advice or opinions or whatever you think is helpful :)",1,2019-01-20 15:22:38,AskAcademia
f6idha,SOSpineapple,t2_555ejelp,I want to quit my PhD but I don't know how to tell my PI,"TL/DR: mental health is suffering and I don't know how to tell my new PI that I want to leave the program.

I am a first year grad student studying microbiology. I moved across the country for what I thought was my dream program. In a lot of ways it is, everyone is very nice &amp; I've made a few solid friends &amp; I am co-mentored by two PIs who are both very patient, kind and understanding. However, I hate it here. I have absolutely no interest in what I'm doing for my research or what I'm learning in classes. I miss my friends and my family and my boyfriend who are all thousands of miles away. I thought I wanted to do research forever, but I am 6 months in and already exhausted by the day to day work as well as the entire atmosphere around me. I spend my time day dreaming about doing literally anything else. I've developed a panic disorder and I have severe panic attacks multiple times a day, almost every day. The idea of doing this for 5-7 more years feels like staring down the barrel of a gun. I've ended up making multiple calls to my campus crisis center. I honestly don't know how no one has noticed that I spend every day on the verge of a breakdown. My therapist is recommending I take a medical leave of absence, but I know if I did I would never come back. I have basically decided that I need to get out, but I don't know how. 

I am fully funded for the next \~18 months on a grant, after which I would apply for fellowships &amp; such. I feel awful because by an unfortunate coincidence, I would be the fourth person to leave this specific project (all bc of personal circumstances, not the PI or the project itself). I also know that I was chosen for this position over other graduate students, meaning that by leaving I am wasting a year of my PIs' funding and leaving them with no one to work on this project, when they could have chosen a student that may have stayed the whole time. 

As I said before, I am being co-mentored and they are both great people. I don't know how to even start this conversation. One of my PIs is also a very new faculty member and I have read that having a PhD student quit can negatively impact chances at grants &amp; tenure. I really don't want to negatively impact my PIs' and I don't want to be the one who ends up sinking this project by leaving. I've barely even started on it. 

I am thinking about asking to change my degree objective to a masters so that I don't leave with nothing &amp; maybe I could help wrap this project up while I am around. I don't know how well that conversation will go, or if its even possible since I only started in the fall of 2019 and am not very far along, technically still in my fourth rotation. 

Is there any advice on how I can start this conversation with my advisers without burning bridges? Is there a typical way people approach this gently &amp; gracefully?",1,2020-02-19 22:11:45,AskAcademia
8h8cqr,Weird2018,,Can I even do something with really bad social skills and mental health issues?,"Hi. Throwaway account here.

I'm an undergrad currently doing a research project at a lab and honestly I'm getting so frustrated. The project is interesting and all people I've worked with so far have been very nice and enthusiastic. I get enough mentoring, maybe to the point where I feel a bit like I'm mostly doing what I'm instructed to do (but I guess as an undergrad that is reasonable and I appreciate it, also I still do a lot myself it's just not me who's coming up with the big ideas). Hearing stories of a few of my friends this is really one of the better labs here, so I guess I'm kind of lucky with that. [TLDR: Undergrad doing research in a cool lab.]

So far so good. I guess in this environment it's impossible not to realize that the others are not the problem, but it's actually me. I'm rather hard working and don't perform too bad I guess (some of my grades could be better, maybe me GPA is already to bad for anything anyway, but this is also the result of a cramped curriculum), but I have terrible social skills, to the point where I'm probably a pain to be around. You know I have social anxiety and it was really bad when I went to the lab for the first time, now it's a bit better, but I still do stuff like say Hi to people in a bad way (like I enter a room full of people hanging around and say Hi when I enter only to realize that I don't know anyone) out of anxiety. However the biggest problem seems to be communication. I guess the worst is that I tend to interrupt others when speaking, I really want to stop that, but it's so hard to unlearn this. Also I struggle not to dissociate in conversations which I think makes me look stupid or even uninterested in what other people say, though I always try to listen, but sometimes even that does not work. Sometimes I'm unable to put into words exactly what I want to say and I wish I was able to contribute to everyone speaking at a meeting (I've been in the situation before where someone else ended up mostly listening and taking notes, but not saying much all the time). [TLDR: I have no social skills, to the point where I'm a nuisance.]

Last year I tried therapy for the first time for half a year and it did only end up make me realize how big my problems actually are. I went there for social anxiety, but this is more like a symptom than the issue. I quit because I'm not financially independent and kept having to justify to my mother because she has to handle the financial stuff (well this is a different story, but let's just say it will not change until I move out which will not be before I have a salary and yeah our University does not offer free therapy only at most 5 counselling sessions per student) and also because I realized that specific therapy was not going anywhere. [TLDR: Currently not in therapy, but have been last year.]

I'm mainly frustrated because besides feeling like a shit person I also wonder if I will make it in time getting better. I really think of this more of a multi-year process where I will first have to move out and then start actually having a social life, but by that time I would have rather already started on a PhD. I guess that won't happen, I am positive no one wants to work with me for a longer time and it is even my fault. Also who will even recommend me for such a position?

Like I'm wondering if I'm not just wasting my efforts, because I won't be able to use what I learn anyway due to my issues or grades. (It's a STEM discipline, but I'm mostly interested in a rather niche field, compared to a few of the other ones.)

I mean what do I do? Do I just keep working and trying anyway at the risk of it all failing due to my personal problems? Or should I hope it will better by next year? (I guess I will have to talk with my mother again about the insurance thing rather or sooner anyway.) Should I just do the master's degree and then go look for industry positions where in the worst case I can go to another company. (But I guess without a PhD I might end up not being able to really work in the field I'm most interested in, at least not on the same kind of projects.) Idk if I was even able to condense what my real issue is in this post but it's just so frustrating that I don't know, like I feel I have many opportunities but keep wasting them. (Another example is an exchange semester which I was really thrilled about but due to complications I was not willing to apply for it at the relevant time, so there is not going to be one during my studies.)",1,2018-05-05 15:51:18,AskAcademia

Before I showed her, I literally had my head in the toilet vomiting and dry heaving from anxiety for hours. I am so so paranoid that my results are wrong and that I'll get accused of academic dishonesty/fabrication (I am 100% honest with my results but there are so many different pipelines that I can use that I'm not sure if it was the ""correct"" one). I have no one in my lab, including my PI, that works on the neuroimaging method that I do. I have spent days ""working from home"" in the lead up before the presentation of my results unable to leave my bed. I either stop eating for a couple days or binge eat all at once. I really need to take time off but my PI is pressuring me to get the second project out as fast as possible due to political reasons completely unrelated to me. Ended up being completely fine with my results. I sent my results section to a co-author that specializes in analyses (but I have a very, very arm's length relationship with them) and has told me that I have used and outdated/simplistic pipeline (univariate analysis with a straightforward regression analysis in order to extend a genotype study done earlier, using the analytic method they used in that paper). She really wants to redo all the analyses from scratch using a complex multivariate analysis that I am in no way familiar with or capable of performing. 

I told this to my PI and she disagrees with the co-author, insisting that the multivariate analysis would only delay the paper and wouldn't change the take home message at all. I'm caught in the middle of the two of them and I'm either sleeping all day or going 2-3 days without sleep due to the sheer anxiety this is causing. I really want to see a mental health professional about this but waitlists for non-suicidal new patients are quite long. I don't want to push this second project as fast and as hard as my PI wants me to (I'm only in my 2nd of 5 years with the first project already published and the third and final project still having a couple years before it is ready for analysis). She's already told me that I've delayed on it (which admittedly I have) and is really pushing hard to get this out ASAP. I'm trying to go with my PI and convince my co-author that this complex reanalysis is wholly unnecessary but she's having none of it and will refuse to let me publish something that she doesn't give her personal stamp of approval on.

8vl91o,ThrowawayAcademic234,,Are PhD programs unethical in today's job market?,"Disclaimer: I’m a STEM PhD student at an R01 University. This post is intended to facilitate discussion; I don’t want to attack anyone personally or anyone’s life choices. I make no attempt to suppress my opinions, but I make every attempt to support them with data. I can only speak to my personal experience in grad school. I can’t speak for the humanities at all, although from what I understand they have an even worse position than STEM grad students.

**My argument is that** **in today’s job market, it’s unethical to lure students into PhD programs****.** The reasoning behind this is simple: there are no more tenure track jobs, and so grad school is no longer worth it. 

PhD’s can get other jobs, yes, but we’ll get to that later. I think the loss of tenure track jobs is more of an existential threat to the structure of grad school than people realize.

**Grad school used to be worth it, but isn’t anymore**

Grad school is basically an apprenticeship. You agree to work for six years (on average in biology) of difficult, stressful, highly technical work for low pay, in exchange for “valuable experience” and a degree. A six year “pause” in your career is an ENORMOUS opportunity cost. Six years of potential career advancement, raises, and work/life balance.

This used to be worth it. Why? Because a tenure track job is a sweet deal: a comfortable middle class lifestyle without middle class drudgery. The chance to obtain tenure, and basically never be fired. Good pay. Good benefits. Excellent flexibility. The opportunity to study whatever you’d like, provided you can get funding. The rewards were obvious, and so the crappy grad school experience is worth it.

But then tenure track jobs disappeared. Today only &lt;10&amp;#37; of biology PhDs go on to obtain tenure-track jobs (https://bit.ly/2MIuJ1j). That means &gt;90&amp;#37; of new PhDs will fail to obtain the “gold standard” job most people want.

**PhDs are not financially worth it, and don’t prepare you for real jobs**

So what to new PhD’s go off and do? Most (70&amp;#37;) do a postdoc, the “default next step” after a PhD. Postdocs are terrible. Doing a postdoc can cost you 20&amp;#37; (!!!) of your earning potential over the next 15 years ([https://bit.ly/2iYReS8](https://bit.ly/2iYReS8)). When postdocs enter the job market (as most postdocs eventually must, because tenure track jobs don’t exist) they find that their 4.5 years of postdoc experience aren’t nearly as valuable as an equivalent amount of job experience.

But of course, you don’t have to do a postdoc. And even if you do, eventually you’ll enter the job market. Most PhDs find that they haven’t been trained to make a career transition. At all. All that time you spent mastering your experimental techniques doesn’t help. Grad students don’t get job interview training, leadership training, or teamwork training. Not even a primer on LinkedIn. This results in a needlessly long job search, further worsening the already bad financial situation that 6 years of grad school have cost you.

But eventually, you get a job. The employment statistics are good: PhDs go unemployed lower than the national average. And PhDs do have a variety of job options: from industry to government to completely non-science related. Usually those jobs pay well. So it’s all worth it, right?

Financially, not really. Six to ten years after graduation, PhDs make no more money on average than their non-PhDs ([https://go.nature.com/2KugIaP](https://go.nature.com/2KugIaP)). And there isn’t much of an increase in job satisfaction either. 

Even if PhD’s did get paid more, the increased salary would have to match or exceed the six years of stagnant wages, *plus the compound interest* that higher wages (and thus more investment) would have earned you. That compound interest ends up being enormous. Most PhDs never recover financially from grad school, let alone a postdoc

**“The intangibles”**

This is usually where the argument bogs down, because numbers are hard to come by. People already know that grad school isn’t a good financial investment (although I don’t think most people realize how bad it actually is). But most people don’t go to graduate school to make money. Most people go to graduate school to pursue their passion for research, and you can’t put a price tag on passion.

PhD programs love this argument. “The intangibles” are the main draw to academia: a life of curiosity, passion, and meaning. Nobody necessarily tells you this outright when you’re applying to grad school, but it’s the underlying story behind every conversation: “Don’t worry: the intangibles make it all worth it.” 

This is actually true for some people. Some people just love research. They’re willing to make all the sacrifices: terrible work/life balance, low pay, and limited career advancement, etc. I get the feeling that some people just tell themselves “it’s all worth it” so they can fall asleep at night, but I’ve also met some true believers. They exist. 

But many people (I’d argue most, but I’m biased) don’t find passion, meaning, or purpose in grad school. Grad school is almost tailor-made to produce burnout. New students enter their programs full of passion, which is systematically beaten out of them over the next six years. 

**Grad school is a mental health crucible**

Grad students are SIX times more likely to experience anxiety and depression than the general population ([https://bit.ly/2Nk13J2](https://bit.ly/2Nk13J2)). Almost half of bioscience grad students are depressed. And no wonder: grad students face a noxious cocktail of stress for years, including :

1. **Terrible work/life balance**. The sheer amount of time you need to spend in lab can be overwhelming. It’s often not realistic to balance the demands of work with exercise, sleep, fun, etc. 

2. **Social isolation**. This depends on the lab, but I know many grad students who spend much of their time alone. Students can spend weeks sitting in a dark microscope room, or pipetting by themselves. Some people might enjoy this, but even the most introverted introvert needs social interaction sometimes.

3. **Excruciating critiques**. Ah, committee meetings. I have these every six months, and it boils down to 6 faculty members telling me that I wasted the last six months of work.

4. **The effort/reward disconnect**. This is actually a huge one. There’s an entire model in psychology that argues that “effort/reward imbalance” (basically, an environment in which tons of effort can result in absolutely no reward) is the main reason people are stressed out and  dissatisfied at work. This is just one review ([https://bit.ly/2NktgiL](https://bit.ly/2NktgiL)) that shows effort/reward imbalance at work can tank your immune system. Personally: my PhD has been nothing but failed experiments and negative results, and my life is waaaay worse as a result.

**So are PhD programs unethical? (the “it’s a choice” argument)**

So, I’ve done my best to prove that 1. There’s no guaranteed reward after grad school 2. PhD’s never really make up the money they’ve lost, and aren’t prepared for “real-world” jobs and 3. The promised intellectual satisfaction, passion, and freedom touted by grad-school recruiters is often impossible to find.

 But just because grad school sucks and probably isn’t worth it, are PhD programs unethical?

I, obviously, would argue yes.

I’ve had this argument, and the main defense I encounter is “We don’t force people to come to grad school”. After all, nobody holds a gun to a prospective student’s head and forces them to come to grad school. It’s a choice.

That’s true. Nobody forced me to come to grad school. But nobody really told me the truth about it either. If universities told the truth about grad school, I don’t think nearly as many people would come.

Universities need grad students. Grad students are the ones doing the actual research at universities. Without grad students, universities would lose millions and millions of dollars in funding. IMO, universities will do *whatever it takes* to recruit enough cheap grad student labor to power their labs. 

I think universities know that grad school is a terrible move for most students, but they accept increasing numbers of new PhD student anyway. Universities know about academic job prospects. They know that students are unprepared for the job market. They know that grad students experience burnout and depression at record rates. *Universities* *know all this,* and are relying on young, idealistic science students to make a mistake and come to grad school. 

And that, IMO, is why PhD programs are unethical.

This ended up being waaaay longer than I intended, and also more rant-laden. Again, I’m not trying to attack anyone personally. Most of the faculty, students, staff, etc. I’ve met in grad school are fantastic people. But if you put fantastic people in a corrupt, rigged system, they’ll do corrupt, rigged things.",1,2018-07-02 18:58:35,AskAcademia
8v4bst,TheMirMorLab,,[Recent Grad]Suggestions on going back to school to Pursue a 2nd (3rd?) Bachelors degree or Masters?,"Good afternoon /r/AskAcademia, I'm in need of advice. I recently graduated a few months ago after 5 years of Education with a Double Major in Business &amp; Marketing and a Certificate in Supply Chain Management. I graduated with a 3.01 GPA, and was wondering what's the best way of turning the knowledge of the certificate into a more comprehensive education that can help me land employment/internship offers?

I recently learned that I was 4 classes/1 Semester away from fulfilling the requirements for the Supply Chain Degree, and could've possibly graduated with 3 Degrees and solidified my seriousness in presenting my education in Supply Chain. I've been applying for internships to a variety of companies, but it feels like they're looking for undergraduate students or students with more relevant fields. It seems that when I present my resume, having the two former Degrees/Majors at the Top, and Supply Chain as a simple certificate is damaging to me when they could opt for someone who's an actual Supply Chain Major. 

What route would you guys recommend in the ""going back to school"" route, that could help me land connections, internships, and ultimately employment?

For some more background: I was dealing with some financial and family issues during the first few years of my college education that affected my mental health and will to perform. I did end up recovering as a person, performed better in the last 2 years scoring mostly As and some Bs which did help me raise my GPA to 3.0+. 

I went into the school blind and found my true passion four years into the fact, but being only a semester away from being a ""Supply Chain Major"" feels like something I need to complete. With that said, am I eligible to apply to universities as a transfer student even though I already graduated with two majors and a certificate, or should I simply opt for a Masters program in Supply Chain Management?

I feel like the years passed by too quickly, and that circumstance forced me to simply go with the flow instead of going out-of-state and truly finding myself without the encumbrance I went through during my formative years.  It would also help that transferring it would start me off with an ""academic blank slate"", and also open up the internship opportunities only offered to undergraduate students. 

This would seem like my best chance of showcasing the ""current me"" who works hard and is capable of graduating with higher marks and the will to learn. What do you guys think, should I pursue this route or go for a masters program?",1,2018-06-30 19:33:00,AskAcademia

I've also more recently been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, which is finally an answer to the unexplained symptoms I've experienced most of my post-adolescent life--extreme, debilitating fatigue and total lack of energy(to the point of fainting occasionally), nearly constant dizziness and motion sickness, crazy headaches, joint pain, etc etc etc. It went undiagnosed largely because of other more obvious symptoms I wasn't experiencing (e.g. no weight gain or hair loss) so doctors just dismissed it as ""stress"" (ugh) until I finally saw the right specialist. 

Problem is, currently there is no end in sight. The medication isn't working so far, and I'm still so tired all the time that I can hardly function. The final version of my MA paper is due mid-May, but needs to be reviewed by my committee first and my advisor before that. Since it's derived from a course paper last year I already have a good deal of it done, but there's still much much more to do, and I haven't given it to my advisor yet to read. With all the other school work as well as my part time serving job, the paper hasn't gotten nearly enough attention. My advisor wants to see it and actually emailed me last week about getting it to her (I had told her I would by March 12th), but I can't send it to her yet, not in its current state. That week I had an especially bad episode that landed me in the ER, so bad that my parents flew from halfway across the country to take care of me. I haven't replied to her email yet because I honestly forgot in all the commotion. Now that everything is relatively stable again, I need to get in touch with her. 

Has anyone ever had to talk to an advisor/supervisor about serious health issues impacting work, and/or had to ask for an extension because of it? OR, even better, is/has anyone here ever actually BEEN an advisor who could offer their perspective? I don't know how to go about responding to her. I have no script for this. She's generally nice and kind of understanding (well, usually), and knows about my thyroid nodule issues, but I have so much anxiety about telling her how it's affecting progress on my work. I have this fear that she'll be so disappointed in me when I tell her I need more time before I can send her a draft--just a couple more weeks--and so I keep neglecting the issue, making it worse. So yeah, any advice would be MUCH appreciated.

TL;DR: I'm behind on a paper in grad school due to major health problems, but am struggling with how to tell my advisor about it. ",1,2018-03-23 19:29:08,AskAcademia
fb6cjn,2020omcthrowaway2020,t2_5qbd1jqr,"PhD students who suffer from depression, what have your advisors done that was helpful/supportive? Or, what do you wish they'd done?","I'm currently going through a period of what I'm finally acknowledging is pretty debilitating depression. I show up for my teaching duties, but that's about it: I've gone several months without checking email, have let basic administrative things go, am not doing well in other parts of my life, sleep a lot, and needless to say have made essentially no progress on my dissertation.

I am trying to confront this with the help of a therapist and, hopefully, soon a psychiatrist. I am also lucky in that my school really, really wants to support me. At several points in the past few months, my advisors have asked how they can support me. We've tried creating regular check-in systems a couple times, but both times I abandoned those after one or two successful check-ins. I'm hoping that now that I'm being more honest with myself and those around me,  and getting more focused mental health care, this time will be different.

But the truth is that whenever they've asked how they can help (which I suspect they will again at our next meeting), I have felt lost, because the enormity of everything seems so overwhelming compared to what I seem to be capable of doing. Perhaps the answer is simply to focus on letting the mental health professionals help, so that hopefully eventually I'll be able to do the work I'm supposed to do for my PhD. As a TA, I'm certainly aware of the fact that a teacher can only do so much for their students, both due to time/resource limitations and lack of mental health training.

Nevertheless, in case there is something helpful I'm missing, I'd love to know if people who have been in similar situations have found anything particularly helpful (or unhelpful...) in terms of what their advisors could do to support them. I do genuinely believe both of my advisors want to help in any way feasible, and the part of me that is holding out hope for getting through this PhD wants to help make that happen as much as I can.

The chair of my thesis (female) has constantly belittled me, does not support me at all, and doesn't foster a positive experience for me. I know she wants to see me crumble to pieces and has told the entire faculty during a meeting that the two graduate students defending will not perform well at all and talked badly about us. Mind you... she is the chair of the entire department... Another professor pulled me aside and mentioned her behavior to me and told me to watch my back and believes she doesn't have my best interest at heart. She even went as far as to tell me, ""Put your big girl panties on and get back to work."" She has also thrown my stuff in the trash before including textbooks. I am an extremely submissive person and I have never talked back to this woman nor defended myself...

My chair has even pitted administrators (females) against me and they play dirty tricks on me. As I was lied to and was sent an email telling me that the administrator who logs our graduate hours was going to be late by 30 minutes and to be there at 8 AM. I arrive in the office at 8:02 and she berated me for being ""late"" and set a trap for me to fall into. She then proceeded to send out an email with multiple people included to belittle me more. They are playing a game of attacking me and there is no way I can win. I absolutely can't stand life and I physically shake and get ill when I have to TA or even be in our research office. They scrutinize everything I do. I have a 3.9... it's not like I'm not a redeemable student.

I mention being female because I recognize that females play drastically different games than men. I am so close to graduation and have so much to lose but they know I can't stand up to them, complain, or do anything... As the department chair is the chair of my thesis... I'm truly SOL.

My mental health fluctuates a lot, sometimes my anxiety is worse than my depression and sometimes it is the other way around.

So, I started a masters in September and I am getting really good grades. Some periods of depressive feelings have kept me from working, but I still made all my deadlines. Right now I need to work on my thesis proposal. I should have handed it in yesterday, but my supervisor is generally pretty chill so handing it in today will not be a big deal. However, I don't see my mental health get better right now and I have no idea how to work with this since my thesis will not have strict deadlines. I feel like the deadlines helped me get my shit together, but right now I feel useless and I have no motivation at all to work on my thesis. I can't take a break, otherwise my funding stops (I live in the Netherlands and our system is weird). I want to talk to a psychologist at the university, but they are very busy and the waiting list is long.

I am afraid to talk to my supervisor about this because I want to get into a PhD program at this university and I think he has a lot to say about this. I'm just scared he will have too much influence on this whole PhD thing and him knowing about my mental health will negatively impact me later or something. I'm not even sure what I'm afraid of exactly, I just want to know if talking to him is the right thing to do. He is a good guy though, I just don't know how he will react if I tell him about this.

fb5yme,doug_gumprecht,t2_4dkl5hzn,Which field should I go into for grad school/PhD program? How difficult is it to go into a different field for a PhD program than your undergrad?,"I’m currently a 3rd year cultural anthropology student (I’m in the U.S. so I have one more year left of undergrad after this). I’m strongly considering applying to grad schools/PhD programs next year but I’m becoming increasingly interested in sociology and psychology. It’s not that I don’t like anthropology anymore, I do want to finish my bachelor’s in anthropology and I’d still consider it for my PhD, but as I’m reading more sociology/psychology books and articles for a class that’s focused on memory I’m becoming more and more interested in sociology/psych so I think I may want to pursue one of those subjects for my PhD. I’ve also always had somewhat of an interest in these subjects so it’s not like sociology and psych are “out of the blue” things for me or that I haven’t thought about them until now. I just haven’t had a chance to read much on these subjects until now because I’ve been busy with ethnographies and anthropological theory. I know my research interests would be the most important factor in this decision but I want to do research in the U.S. on subjects that could be done in all 3 fields (how relationships work, sexuality, mourning, mental health/illness, and things like that). 

So my main question is which field should I apply to based on “job market” or my chances of getting into a program or which program would be more beneficial in general or anything else that could factor in? My other question is if I were to switch from an undergrad in anthropology to a PhD in sociology or psych, how difficult would that transition be if at all? My decision obviously doesn’t solely rely on the comments but I’d really appreciate some opinions and insights since I don’t have any family or friends who have went for their PhD before. I’m also going to ask my professors and other faculty at my university but I do want to know some more opinions. Thanks!

fdieki,MistyMeow,t2_7k8iy,How do I know if working in academia is suitable for me?,"Hi all, 

Long time lurker on this subreddit and finally gathering enough courage to ask this burning question I've been consumed with for some time.

A bit about me... I'm from Australia, currently studying Communications but focusing on English literature and Digital Media. I am half-way through my bachelors, but previously spent a year studying a different degree. This journey helped me discover my love for research and writing, and I have been intending to pursue research within the field of digital humanities.

My university over the summer offers a research program where you help an academic with their work. In 2018-19, I did this program for the first time and while slightly disappointing because the academic was a bit disengaged, it was immensly fulfilling to work on a project I was passionate about. 

2019-20 I entered into this research program again, this time assisting an academic with a literature review in humanities (sorry to keep things vague). I chose this project because I thought I was passionate about it, had a personal connection to it, and did extremely well at a class earlier in the year that contained content underpinning the larger project. While the program has officially ended, I am still working on my share of the work.

I am feeling extraordinarily guilty that my work is now a month ""overdue"". My supervisor is aware and completely fine with this as she is still working on hers and the submission date for this article isn't until later in the year. And while I have been dealing with some major life changes through this 4-month span (starting a study abroad, mental health, etc), I feel like a massive failure and it's affecting my ability to actually just complete this thing. Every time I attempt to start I feel extremely anxious, and because a lot of the concepts are very complex and not necessarily my area of speciality, I feel like even when I am able to write, I am not doing the content justice. 

All of this is making me question whether I'm really cut out for a career in academia. With my tendency for perfectionism and pre-existing mental health issues, just finishing this project - which should be really simple, since most of the sorting and coding of the literature is done - feels like a behemoth task. 

I don't really know what I'm asking with this post. What does it take to make a career in academia? I'm hoping that the anxiety I have surrounding this project is just because it's not something I am 100% passionate about - but in the real world, in the work place, how often do you get to always work on things you're passionate about? I feel very alone right now, and not sure how to overcome this hurdle - I am the first in my family to pursue university, so I don't really have any blueprint to follow. I also don't know how to handle my supervisor, because while she is ridiculously kind, understanding and funny, I can't help but feel like I've let her down. 

I hope this makes sense, I'm sorry for the wall of text.",1,2020-03-04 19:38:09,AskAcademia

Just graduated with my master of education in clinical mental health counseling May of '18. I'm a Licensed Professional Counselor - Intern and work as an adult case manager at a local mental health authority getting my 3k hours to be fully licensed.

As a single mom, I don't see myself going into private practice, too risky. Although I'm going to do some research into it. 

I like the idea of research, teaching, a more flexible schedule (depending on the university).

I've spoken with a number of my professors at length about what it is like to be a professor at the university I just graduated from so I have an idea what my days may be like. However known this may change depending on who is chairing.

WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT:
Becoming a counseling professor would allow me to be able to move to a bigger city and have enough $ to live in a safe neighborhood and provide for my daughter. I also may stay where I am. I will hopefully be around more mature people and less drama (?)? I'm burned out as a case manager and dont see my client base  changing much once I'm an LPC. The population at my job is extremely intense and demanding.

MY RESERVATIONS:
My daughter is 2. She basically had a sperm donor. My mother is basically her second parent. 
I would have childcare the days I have class and on weekends while I'm doing homework.

I'm afraid I'll miss her growing up for 2 years. That I'll be so stressed and worn down and busy that I won't be able to enjoy anything with her because I'll have work, school work, class, cooking, cleaning, and a 3 hour round trip for class too.

TL;DR I am burnt out as a case manager and fear I'll have the same issues as an LPC since it is the same client base so want to get my doctorate to become a professor. But it's a 3 hr round trip and I'm a single mother of a 2 year old working full time. 

Is getting my doctorate worth the time being away from my daughter? Personal choice I know. I want feedback.

I’m obviously behind and haven’t done as much as my peers have now (though I’m a month behind), and I’m worried the people marking both won’t consider this. One person in admin has said that though they have a note of my struggles it ultimately makes no difference, and yet a colleague has said that I should keep a record so I can rightfully explain what’s happened and it should be fine. 

I’d of thought that it would be considered and would explain why I might not have done as much as everyone else, but I don’t know what to think about it. If it isn’t going to make a difference then there’s little point continuing the PhD. 

Any advice would be great. ",1,2019-01-29 15:56:59,AskAcademia
fa04jj,FailExamination1234,t2_5se8k6fb,How to move past bad grades and mental health issues when you want to get into something specific?,"Hi all, this ended up a bit long but I tried to emphasize the main points and I added my personal situation for context but it's not really essential to my question so it can be skipped. 

Academic situation:

* I'm **about to graduate my masters** (in Europe), I have to pass just two more courses, a semester thesis and then a master thesis. (So I would finish next year.)
* The courses aren't directly related to what I'm interested in, because it's too specific and I've had all the introductionary courses already.
* I **did 2 research projects** with different people and I think the work was solid (although not ""perfect"" either, like one thing didn't work out as hoped) but I'm not really networking, don't know how it works and terrible social skills, actually I wouldn't be surprised if they think I'm weird or think badly of me for never contacting them afterwards.
* I **finally know two fields that really interest me** both in the big field of artifical intelligence (RL and SNN), but I performed badly during exams related to these fields and cannot make up for it...
* Also completely failed a couple courses not related directly to my interest, my master's **transcript is terrible**. My bachelor transcript was a lot better.

Personal situation:

* I've exploited most of my university's counseling, and it was mostly bad. The therapist they ended up suggesting to me 3 years ago really wasn't able to help me like I kept getting worse and I wasted a lot of time because I was too low to switch (and the bureaucracy of switching therapists), until I finally did last year. Still, it really was mainly my mental health that made my grades so bad.
* I'm doing a bit better now with different professionals and getting tested for ADHD soon. If it turns out positive, at least I know why everything academic related is a mess and hopefully will find a solution to it (otherwise it will probably be antidepressants again, though I don't have the full blown depression right now).
* But I'm still impaired to the point where **I can function like 20-40%** of what healthy people would and my working memory is really bad. I usually compensate by pouring all my energy into studying, and this leads to burn out eventually. 
* Also my social life is almost non existent. I live with my family because it's an expensive city, and we don't have a campus culture like in the US. 

Questions:

1. Is it realistic to even think about a PhD at this point? I don't really strive for an academic career, but I would like to conduct research. (Also the PhD itself would be interesting.)
2. If I don't get a PhD, is it realistic to do some kind of research in a company with a bad master degree? I don't find many positions advertised in these fields, like I guess they do their own hiring, and if a position is advertised it very rarely aligns with what I'm interested in, in the best case they want someone to throw deep learning at a problem, but I'm more interested in like novel concepts.
3. What options are there still to change the situation?",1,2020-02-26 20:58:10,AskAcademia

I've consistently done well at the high school and university level, with grades usually among the top 5 in my programs. However, in the last semester of my taught masters program earlier this year, things were difficult for me mental health wise. My university was politically unstable, with an almost two month long boycott of formal classes by many students and teachers.

9pxlj6,Groundbreaking_Curve,t2_2g4p3g8y,Psychotic postdoc.,"We have an absolutely terrible postdoc in our research group. While not evident when she was interviewing, she became incredibly open about her mental illnesses (bipolar, depression) after joining on and is also open about the fact that she doesn't manage these issues (e.g., stopped taking her medication). She has had several instances of telling one of our staff that she wants to kill herself. My concern isn't for her mental health nor wellness, but more the fact that she uses these problems as license to be very very awful to everyone. I can sympathize with her suffering, but not with her attitude and behavior. 

The general sentiment is ""well, at least she does good work"". I feel like a lot of people use this excuse for the shitty behavior of others in academia. It's along the same line as ""we've always done things this way so why change"". I've spoken to the PI and he's spoken to her but it 1. hasn't improved and 2. he feels his hands are tied due to ADA. 

I appreciate that my work isn't directly tied to her so I don't really work ""with"" her. That said, working in the toxic space she's managed to whip up with her presence alone (which I'm sure many will understand in terms of that one person who just manages to ruin the workplace 'feel') is enough to make most want to keep away from shared spaces if she is there or likely to be there.

8kwurg,mattioso,,How does one frame research through inductive reasoning within the relevant literature?,"Hi all,

Going to try and keep this as brief and as clear as possible, I've proven to not be the best at explaining this question to others today so I'm hoping for the best here!

Undergrad dissertation in the UK, conducted primary research interviewing ex-prisoners about diet, health and exercise practices and values. Approached this from a completely inductive standpoint, no assumptions of theories pre-established to test against their responses. I wanted to sit and listen to what they had to say to formulate ideas from, with a few prompts/open questions about the topic loosely if they hit a wall.

I've been asked to conduct an approximately 2500 word literature review to frame my work within the academic field, and I'm at a bit of a loss as to what is the most appropriate way to do this. 

I began reading around the topic as much as possible and broke my work down into five prominently spoken about topics: How poor prison nutrition fuels deviancy, difficulty managing weight within prison, ailing mental health help in institutions etc. Through conducting thematic analysis in my transcripts however, I've identified five key themes such as: Food as a form of autonomy and control, exercise as a part of the identity, newly formed codes of hygiene etc.

As you can see the themes explored are completely different and not at all consistent with one another. I'm unsure how I should go about this. As I mentioned I struggle to articulate what my real issue is and what I see as my potential workarounds, so please see the below mock methods I feel are available to me.

1 - I change my literature review and read around the themes I've found through my research. I state outright ""these themes emerge through academic study etc etc I will later contrast them to my own work and use it to situate its place within the literature etc.""

2 - I change my literature review to match my themes and pay no conscious mind to it. I simply conduct a literature review, 500 words roughly on each of the work in my emergent themes, then later in my discussion of results compare and contrast it.

3 - I keep the themes I have researched as a general inspection of the most prominent study within the field of research, writing as though I have not conducted my research yet. I then go into the discussion of my results, and am more than likely able to draw analysis less between literature and my results than I would in option 1 or 2. 

If anybody is able to make sense of this issue and offer me any advice on the matter please do let me know!

I've been out of school for a few years and am in the midst of applying to several MA/MS programs in clinical psychology.

Broadly, I'm interested in refugee youth (18-25) and their mental health outcomes post-settlement. The goal is to establish and improve best practices for helping them adapt and adjust to their new environments. My thesis idea is then to look at internal vs external factors of resilience in refugee youth and see how that would influence risk of developing depression and substance use problems.

My concern is that resilience research is very much a current, popular topic. I'm afraid that it's over-researched and that my ideas will be seen as boring and unoriginal. None of the faculty I've chatted with have been super enthusiastic about my proposal, even when there's an intersect with their research focus.

So I don't know if I'm just feeling the normal soul-crushing self doubt that is the norm in grad applications or something more. I'm hoping that others in the psych field have some thoughts or advice? ",1,2018-10-21 17:30:22,AskAcademia

2fjcke,[deleted],,"I'm overwhelmed by the myriad areas of study and am fascinated and impassioned by so many of them. I'm nearly 26 and feel like I'll always be ""lost"". Please, help me [to help myself]?","If there is but one thing that has been a constant throughout my it would be my passion for knowledge. I've taught myself so much via the Internet over the last decade (Filmmaking; 3D Modelling; Programming; Game Development; Web Development/Design; Graphic Design; Animation; Music Composition/Production; History; Physics; Astronomy; Mathematics et al.). I've explored so many topics and with some of them I have devoted Years to it and ventured very deep and yet I still can't figure out what I *really* want to do. I've been trying to figure that out for more than 10 Years. I know that no one else can really *tell me* what I'm supposed to do but... I'm desperate and I need help.

I've been to College *three* times but I either chose the wrong subject, or went for the wrong reasons and on every occasion; I left [early] with nothing (to be fair, I was forced to due to mental health on two of those). If I don't figure this out soon, I fear I will fall back into depression and then my life will truly be over as I can't deal with this for much longer. I've been spending quite a lot of time as of late trying to figure this out. I want--no, *need*--to be studying, come [next] September. I've always wanted a degree as well as a career that I can devote myself to for the rest of my days. My life is, for the most part, devoid of meaning (as is the Universe, really) but I feel that figuring this out will impart a greater meaning to my existence.

My passion for Science seems near-unparalleled in relation to everything else (except the Music, which is roughly on the same level) and I am almost certain that it *is* what I'm supposed to dedicate my life to. I've been passionate about Music since the age of 3 which is slightly longer than my passion for Science (and History... and...) but I've tried studying Music and I don't think it was the right thing to do. Plus, you have to be so very talented and lucky to make it in that World. But even if I *could* choose a branch of Science, there is still a great deal to choose from within each and truly - I am incapacitated by choice. The only thing I am [something resembling] certain of is that I am far more interested in the Natural Sciences (and to a lesser extent, the Applied), than the Social and Formal (although the latter does interest me to quite a degree - I do have a Computer Science background, afterall).

It's probably fair to say that I was always more interested in Astronomy and Physics (in that order) than Biology and Chemistry (again, in that order I *think*) however practically everything fascinates me; so much so that it scares me. I am just as intrigued and awestruck by Biology and Chemistry as I am by Astronomy and Physics. They all really get my brain going and cause questions to arise and ideas to form. I don't know what to do anymore and I feel as though *this*--this eternal search--is my ""fate"" and I will never, ever, figure this out. I research and research and research alas it merely leads to more questions; it would appear that there are no answers.

My efforts have often been temporarily thwarted by my mental health (I have struggled with depression amongst other things for half of my life) but things are currently the best they've ever been and so I am once more dedicating myself to the painstaking task of finding my true purpose.

I have struggled throughout the course as I don't enjoy most of it and I have lost a lot of my motivation. My project supervisor provides very little support as he works full-time in industry. To make matters worse, I have to use a programme to generate data (MCNP) and I don't have a clue how to use it, so the dissertation is going nowhere at the moment.

What are my options?","This is quite long so I apologize but I genuinely appreciate whoever reads it, and especially those that can give advice. 

I was abused as a kid (my mother was an angel during it, I have no need to but want to clarify) and have PTSD from it. Depression and anxiety since I was 11, intense suicidal urges and thoughts since 12, and ADD. School was awful but I managed to graduate with honors and got a near full ride first generation scholarship to a nice school. 

None of my mental health problems were addressed, however, so I ended up in a really bad situation and had to drop out.


They finally peaked this past March when I had a PTSD episode unlike anything I’d experienced that ended with me being admitted into a partial rehabilitation program that, quite literally, saved my life. Mentally, I am way better and although it’s still hard due to everything occurring, I finally feel alive enough to actually want to live my life and finish college. ((I include this because I’m not sure if it’s relevant to 4 year or even higher education programs when considering me, but it affected me a lot))

My problem is that my track record looks awful. 

Fall 2016- fall 2017: gap year 
Fall 2017- fall 2018: attended 4 year college for one year, ended with medical withdrawal and 2 point something GPA
Fall 2018: no classes 
Spring 2019- spring 2020: failing most classes, retaking them and passing, but repeatedly failing one math class. Spring 2020 is when I had to withdraw again due to my episode. 

I am now back at community college and my GPA is subpar at 2.5, I believe, but I’m on track to get only A’s and B’s this semester. I was aiming for all A’s but sadly don’t think that’s possible now. 

My anhedonia made it so that I wasn’t able to maintain an interest in much, but I always enjoyed learning and hearing about anatomy, how the human body works, why, etc., and am taking a biology class I’m actually interested in. All of that makes me want to pursue a career as a PA of some sort. After reading all of that I’m sure I sound insane, so I just want to know: how insane am I? 

Is it proper decorum to contact the admissions office at a PA school and see what they’d need to see from me to even consider my application? My counselor at my community college can’t tell me much besides how to get accepted into a 4 year to attend my last 2 years of school. Would I have to wait until then to see a counselor that could properly help? What can I do to make my resume look more promising? 


I’m having a lot of trouble being hopeful about the future because every time I speak to my friends (who are all very successful already), all they say is that I should be a medical interpreter (I’m bilingual, working on trilingual), or a beautician, or an esthetician, or “have you considered being a makeup artist? Your eyeliner always looks *so* good!” Which I know they only say because they want to help somehow, but it’s almost insulting at times. My interest in my looks has always been due to not feeling as if I have any purpose and was worthless so I might as well try to be pretty while taking up space; it was not because I was genuinely passionate about spending 1 &amp; 1/2 hours getting ready each day just to disappoint my teachers and mother in $45 foundation. 

I feel as if I need encouragement or advice, or even both. Anything, as I feel helpless, silly, and inept.

k9goun,standcam,t2_11skcp,[Advice Request] Anyone ever experienced co-authors who are using their seniority/authority to block paper submissions?,"Hey all

I have a dilemma here that is costing me quite a lot of sleep/my mental health and I'm not sure what I should do in this situation:

During my PhD (3.5 years in UK) I produced drafts of 4 first author papers. 2 were published in reasonable journals (Impact Factor 5-10) before I had my PhD defense. Now (as a postdoc in another university) I am really struggling to publish the other 2 drafts. The reason I am struggling is because my supervisor insists that I work with the 2 co-authors (one of whom have also moved from my PhD group) on the paper drafts due to their superior experience in the field, as they have each been in the area for nearly 15 years. However both co-authors keep using any means possible to delay any of their contributions to the paper, with excuses such as teaching, exam marking, Covid etc. In the last 3 years or so since defending my PhD I have majorly revised the drafts for both papers almost 5-6 times each and sent them to the co-authors, only for them to virtually neglect the drafts each time despite responding to me via email that they'd work on it which they of course never follow through with. I have like 20 emails in which they have promised to look at the paper and return a draft to me in 2 weeks but most certainly never follow through with. 

I believe under normal circumstances I could  - as first author - simply submit without any input from them seeing as I've given them enough opportunity to voice their feedback; however this is where things get complicated: **My PhD supervisor has forbidden me from submitting the papers without input from both co-authors, despite knowing all the above about how they have delayed looking at the papers.** Disobeying my PhD supervisor could put my career/reputation in danger given how highly reputed he is within my field. (I've seen several colleagues - PhDs and postdocs - have their careers heavily jeopardised as a result of submitting papers without permission from the supervisor and as a result straining their professional relationship). Unfortunately, since both my co-authors have tenure/a large publication record already they are under less pressure to publish and so getting them to even look at my paper/give any feedback is impossible. I have been patient with them all these years and been as polite as I can - and even at one point tried to offer co-first-authorship to one of them in an attempt to get them to prioritise this paper more - but nothing has worked and they have barely even budged. It is driving me crazy that they are clearly too happy to damage my publication record - for which each first author paper makes a significant difference at this stage in my research career - just because the papers do not affect them much.

Does anyone have any suggestions please what I should do in this circumstance?

kamz9z,Ok_Currency_6191,t2_7erx1fqp,Transphobia in academia? How to handle?,"Hi,

I am ftm trans and attending college for the third time (dropped out twice) and I'm wondering how to address the transphobia I've been experiencing? I am a part of a scholarship that meets weekly for a project and the group i am in consistently uses my dead name as a joke. In the same weekly meetings, I've been deadnamed by other students and referred to as she/her or a girl, even by the professor. The professor called me a woman and used she/her for me, and apologized and has never slipped again. However, my groupmates who i work with consistently and talk to every day almost, will call me a girl or use she/her and have made jokes about my deadname. This is not the only circumstance that i have come across while attending this school. When i first got accepted I went to ask if there was a way to use a nickname for my classes as I did not want to be called my birth name (i have not petitioned for a change of name yet which is also a part of my real name). I have been able to do this in my previous college and wanted to see if it would be possible here. However I was faced with a lot of hostility and anger from the lady at the front desk who demanded i show proof. overall my experience has been uncomfortable, save for the few understanding professors. However, the whole scholarship thing has really been taking a toll on my mental health. I feel like i'm crazy for feeling upset about this and that i shouldn't bring it up. However, i don't want these people to think i'm okay with them using my dead name as a joke or that it's fine for them to continuously use wrong pronouns. I'm a pretty understanding person when it comes to these things too, I try to be patient and understanding as possible but it feels personal at this point. We've been meeting for months now, consistently, and I am presenting masc. I feel like if it were not for my legal name being displayed all over my online classes, i might not have these problems, however theres no way I can change that, especially not now. anyways, any help or advice is helpful. please let me know. thank you .",1,2020-12-10 20:07:20,AskAcademia

hi8q6r,ktitts,t2_3377ybik,What else can I do? (Job Search),"I graduated last spring with a BA in Psychology. I really want to go into neuroscience, and realize getting a BA wasn't exactly the right track to go on. I'm now almost finished with my MS in psych. I'm a first gen college student, so I really didn't know what I was getting into. It wasn't until junior year I realized my passion for neuropsychology. That being said, I was only able to squeeze in an advanced chem lab and a physiology lab. So my lab experience is present, but pretty small. I also went to a small liberal arts school, so not sure if it holds much ground.   


I was published, and presented my research at a conference. I did an internship at a mental health hospital, and did independent research with faculty. All of these experiences are more social psychology directed, so not sure if they really hold weight.   


I guess what I'm wondering is...will I ever get into any lab assistant positions that aren't social psychology? I've applied to over 40 labs across the US in the past 9 months intermittently with no takes. Did I literally screw myself by not doing more scientific lab work in my undergrad? Is there anything else I can do? I really want to apply to PhD programs in the next year but fear I won't have recommendation letters from a lab that can back me up.

hfz1xs,Objective-Sure,t2_710sjmi7,"If I was to enter the job market with either a humanities PhD or a JD, which market would be worse?","Hey everyone, I am concerned about my future. I am currently in a terminal MA program at an Ivy League University. I enrolled with the initial intention to pursue a PhD in the humanities. (There is a joint program I am interested in that combines American Studies with Film/Media). My department is extremely well-connected and I believe I have very strong chances of receiving funding from a top program. Yet after reading posts and looking at PhD job placements on university websites, I think I have gained a more realistic awareness of the academic job market. I also am not sure if I could imagine myself teaching(?). 

If a PhD is not a wise decision or viable option, I think the only profession I could imagine myself being in is law where I could apply my penchant for writing, research, and argument. I have lately been attracted to this profession because of its seriousness and responsibility (side note: I am an INTJ).

I think there are a lot of other factors that weigh in to either option. However, a huge priority for me is mental health. After doing this master’s I just do not feel mentally stable and I am concerned that a PhD would worsen my mental health. For example, I am writing an essay and it is utter torture. I am sort of questioning my commitment to writing and especially academic writing...Is this necessary for me to research? Do I really have something to say? Or am I merely just interested in reading theory for pleasure? 

I am truly considering whether or not having an employable degree from somewhere like a T14 law school would be a better option for me. But again, I have heard the job market for law is horrible and to what extent is this true in comparison to a humanities PhD?

I understand that neither are perfect options because there are corresponding financial or opportunity costs for each one. But alas, if faced with this decision what are the pros and cons for either/or? Or what questions should I be asking and considering so that I can figure this out?",1,2020-06-26 02:09:05,AskAcademia
hfmoz2,Chemistfromtheeast,t2_61bye8fy,"I am losing hope for the first time in my life, and I don't know what to do. Is there any hope of getting a postdoc in this economy (location doesn't matter) if the lab is decent.","I have always been an overachiever. 

I got great grades in school while spending minimum efforts. In my bachelor's in Pharmacy, I was partying and living my best life, lots of friends and great social life, by the end I graduated in the 95th percentile in my class of over 90 students. 

Comes post-grad, same story, party living still doing great academically, and my research yielded one decent paper in a reputable chemistry journal IF = 4.2. Then in my PhD I actually decided to put in the hours, and I gave it my all. I accumulated enough data for 3 articles in very decent journals IF 3-5. I also published a review in a Journal with IF \~4. And now expected to graduate in 5 months (2.5 years in total). But at what cost? 

I was paid to do the PhD which is good, but what did it cost me otherwise? Well, mental health is super fragile now, wrecked with anxiety and depression. I lost my friends and social life (I was spending 10-14 hours in the lab everyday, and most weekends, for about 2 years). I lost my love life, I was quite active romantically before all this. I lost my physique, I used to be super fit now i weigh 60kg and just generally looking weak. 

By graduation, I'd have 5 papers as a first and corresponding author in Q1 org chem/med chem journals (3-5 IF). And 3 papers as co-author in equally good journals. I thought giving all I got would guarantee I get rewarded with good job/postdoc position prospects. I emailed and applied to over 30 places. I got a response rate of about 70% apologizing and saying sorry no space or no funding. I am lost and devastated. After two years of neglecting myself and just giving my all to academia, I got nothing to show for it. And honestly I forgot what's it like to do anything else. This is all i know now. I don't know why am writing all this, but is there really hope for me? I mean keeping my eyes for applications and applying or cold emailing is a tedious process. For each application or email i spend 4-6 hours, comprehensively gathering the most I can. and writing the most customized letter.  

Should I just give up on academia? Is there really any hope left to get a postdoc in medicinal/synthetic/or natural products chemistry in these times? Because if not, I should just look for something else. Sorry for this rant but this feeling is new to me, and I am not sure how to handle failure. 

P/S: I know my papers are not science, or nature quality, but I am also not punching way above my weight. I did not email the likes of Phil Baran or Scott Denmark. I know these guys wont even look at my credentials.",1,2020-06-25 14:07:07,AskAcademia
j2ty3o,unofficial_supergirl,t2_3a6hbkki,Am I doing the right thing?,"
Hi Academics,

Firstly I'm really sorry for how long this post is, and if I'm in the wrong subreddit to ask- but I hope you have time to read it and offer some advice.

I'm struggling a little bit, as I don't have many people to ask for help regarding this. My own parents aren't great, and I've grown up in a really toxic, emotionally abusive household which resulted in quite a significant anxiety disorder. My mum has suspected (undiagnosed due to how mental healthcare works here) bipolar disorder, and comes from a really shallow and narrow minded family herself. My dad is a boat steadier and has a tendency to completely ignore anything that isn't pandering to my mum, thus letting her get away with a lot. To compound things, I also have a profoundly disabled brother, whom I adore and I also count him as one of my best friends, but it is a difficult situation with caring for him as well as being in a crap place with my parents. We do get a lot of community support and help, and whilst my parents are great to my brother, they have nothing left to give to the rest of us. My older brother pretty much abandoned us when he could, and my older sister moved back in with her children after escaping an abusive relationship. As you can imagine, home is an intense place and I pretty much brought myself up due to the unintended neglect that resulted from the pressures on my parents of having a disabled child- but this means I often don't have anyone to go to for advice so I hope to find some here.

Last summer I graduated from my Bachelors Degree in Geography, and I focussed my dissertation on disability inclusive disaster risk reduction (a mouthful, I know). This is an area I'm really keen to go into, as I have experience with my brother and I'm really passionate about social inclusion and safety for all. I managed to do fairly well at university, even though my brother was really poorly and at times it was touch and go, my dad had a double heart bypass, and my mum frequently abandoned us to travel for long periods of time. I studied away from home but I came home pretty much every weekend to cook and clean and generally hold things down. Obviously with Covid, university was suspended and I graduated in absentia as we were all asked to go home. At home, things deteriorated as cabin fever set in, with my mum and dad turning really nasty and horrible to me and my sister.

This meant that I applied for a postgraduate masters course under a lot of stress, and it was an absolute miracle that I was accepted. My undergraduate supervisors and tutors were really keen for me to pursue postgraduate study, and even discussed my potential willingness to go on to a PhD, as my goal is to work in developing inclusive policy at regional, national, and maybe one day international scales however I recognise I lack significant skills and qualifications to get me on that career path. Pre-Covid, I was accepted to work as a retail stock manager at a world sporting event which unfortunately was cancelled and my contract rescinded, but the money and prestige earned from working in this role would have significantly financed the living costs associated with my masters. Of course with covid and having immunocompromised family members, it's not as though I can just go out and work which is what I would ordinarily do, but doing so would put my brother's health at risk and I can't face even balancing the risk of losing the only family member I have a good relationship with yet. I had really wanted to move out again for my masters, but as teaching is mostly remote, I can't justify the costs of moving and renting with the limited funds I have available.

In order to circumvent this, I've been emailing charities and organisations that may have contacts who can point me towards bursaries or beneficiaries, but I'm really struggling to have any financial luck. I was approved a loan by Student Finance, but as it goes in the UK, it just about covers tuition and leaves very little on which you can cover the costs of additional things such as textbooks, travelling for labs, and just general existence. I would like to know where I'm going wrong, so I'm pasting a template of what I use and adapt for each individual organisation (after I research and personalise to ensure it's bespoke) that I contact regarding any funding. 

I also wonder if I'm being too big headed and arrogant, and if it is presumptuous to think I am even worth someone going, do you know what, let's give her some money to pull her through. I think that may be low self esteem and self worth associated with my anxiety, but I am actually concerned as my parents often call me arrogant and self entitled. I don't even know if going ahead with postgraduate education is even a good idea considering everything that is currently happening, and if I've overestimated my abilities and capacities. 

Conversely, I do think that if I secured a small bursary to put towards the costs, it would stand me in very good stead if I do go ahead with applying for a PhD- and most importantly, whilst many organisations haven't been able to offer funding or bursaries, I have been offered two fantastic volunteering roles on projects that help children who are classified as young carers as I myself was. I did a lot of volunteering for vulnerable young people pre-pandemic, and I really missed being able to do so which means that these organisations have offered me one lifeline in that I can actually do something even if it's over zoom and not necessarily in person. 

I guess what I'm asking for is some reassurance and advice on what I could do to improve my messages, or maybe if people knew organisations that may be able to help? Or, if any of you were in situations similar to mine and how you overcame it. 



The email template I use: 

I am writing to you to enquire whether you have any information regarding scholarships, bursaries, or sponsors that are available to young adult carers. I have recently been accepted a place at the University -------  to study an MSc in ----------, having completed my undergraduate degree in Geography at the University -------- .
 
My interests stemmed from having been a carer for my profoundly disabled younger brother since I was five years old. As I grew older and more involved in his care needs, I was struck by the extent of the inaccessibility in our lived environments. By my early teens, I had significant caring responsibilities for my brother to the detriment of my own education. My school attendance rate was 60% due to these responsibilities, and yet I developed a sense of injustice at the battle we fought to get my brother his statutory right to formal education. I contributed to essential meetings of adults at tables with my feet barely touching the floor. My contributions were simultaneously instrumental to the recognition of his needs, and dismissed by the very people who did not allow me to the child I should have been. This battle catalysed my teenage activism, leading to years of campaigning, volunteering, and fundraising through my distinct lens and experiences as a young carer.
 
Being an aware campaigner stimulated my interest in environmental issues and spurred me to my degree in Geography at the University --------, which focused my interest in the complex relationship between human society and our physical habitat. There is increasing recognition that greater resilience and sustainability against climate instability is necessary. However, the means to do so is reserved for the privileged with education, material resources, and crucially, without disabilities. Continuing upheavals such as the current COVID-19 pandemic highlight the importance of planning and international cooperation.
 
At ---------, in between coming home to look after my brother and mum on weekends, I developed a specific interest in disability inclusive disaster risk reduction, which I subsequently researched in my undergraduate dissertation. My interest in accessibility, as well as my grades in certain modules made me stand out to my lecturers, who encouraged me to continue pursuing my academic career and guided me to this taught masters at the University ---------, in the hopes that I would gain the additional skills needed to continue onto a PhD specialising in disability inclusive disaster risk reduction. This is an area of growing importance and relevance to our lives, not simply due to the widely recognised uncertainties within climate change, but also the growing global and regional instabilities worldwide.
 
My aspiration is to work in inclusive policy making, as I want to use my capabilities to compensate for the lack of disability-inclusion in disaster risk reduction, considering the multifaceted issues we are facing. Studying at the --------- would give me the opportunity to further refine the research skills I gained from the University --------- in a field more relevant to my interests. As you can understand, the lack of research in this area, my experience as a carer, and my interests in filling this research gap puts me in the unique position of having the potential to do so. Whilst the drive and the recognition is there, the financial burden of doing so may be a preventative factor. I have taken the maximum post graduate student loan available, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and my parents’ own financial concerns in the economic upheavals, I am keen to find additional scholarships, bursaries, or sponsors if there are any available. This would make it a lot easier to continue my work as an unpaid carer, as well as developing my academic contributions towards ensuring the safety and security of people with disabilities in disaster situations.",1,2020-09-30 20:23:59,AskAcademia
fku4uh,farahgh,t2_2kobp0e4,"feeling lost, thinking about quitting my MA in English Language","Hello

I am currently in my third semester at AUB (American University of Beirut) in Lebanon pursuing a master's degree in English language (linguistics). it is the best university in the region and has a reputation internationally. I got a 100% scholarship and this is why I entered this program. 

I must say that I knew the program was weak and nothing like what I want, but it was a great opportunity and in my country, options are almost non-existent. 

I have been having breakdowns and increased anxiety and frustration since last fall, but now it has gotten to an all-time high. I feel like a zombie and im doing the worst academic performance in my academic history. I stopped caring about quality and I just want to submit things and get them over with. it is worth mentioning that around last fall, a revolution in my country started, coupled with an economic crisis, and now we are all on lockdown due to Corona. I feel like I finally exploded and hit rock bottom.

Today during online class, we had a peer-review on our lit. reviews and mine needs the most work and rewriting. I literally muted my mic and started crying right away in the middle of the class just thinking about having to re-do it. this is where I completely broke down and I am seriously considering dropping out. I am so confused because I am in my third semester, so I still have a semester and a thesis, but I really don't know if I can keep going. 

I discovered that I don't really want to do linguistics as a career and noticed that I am much more interested in sociology and anthropology. I am now taking a break to weigh my options and see whether:

1- I should start a new bachelor's degree in social sciences in my country or abroad

2- I should stay and continue my master's (at the expense of my mental health)

3- I finish the courses and try to do my thesis abroad? (I highly doubt that would be manageable)

and these are just what came to my mind directly. 

I am not even sure I want to do a Ph.D anytime soon. I feel like this whole experience made me discover that I don't want to spend my life in academia. it should be noted that my classmates are also bothered by the pressure of the semesters but they seem to be interested in what they're doing and have their goals clear and grounded in academia.

I feel very alone in this and that no one understands, hell, I don't even understand, but all I know is that I want my career to be something that is social work oriented and do research that has impact on problem-solving in the real world. linguistics just doesn't do that. I love languages and im a linguistically intelligent person, but I discovered that I would prefer to read about it as a hobby and not as a career especially the research part of it. I am really lost and I feel stuck.

hmcpsd,Chlorophilia,t2_idccd,Year 1 of PhD and feeling utterly burned out and finished,"I'm sorry for the incoming rant! 

I'm coming to the end of the first year of my PhD (UK) and I'm feeling completely finished. On the outside, everything has gone extremely well. Science is what I love and I was never really able to see myself doing anything else. As an undergrad I finished top in my year at a world-leading university, with lots of research experience on the side that led to two first-author papers. I went straight into a PhD programme at the same university, for a project that I designed myself with a wonderful supervisor. My PhD research is officially going well and I'm on target to hit the milestones, all of this whilst working embarassingly few hours.

Despite this, I'm hating it. My research fills me with anxiety to the point where I often feel physically sick and I'm constantly paranoid that I've messed up and will be outed as incompetent or a fraud, or that my work isn't novel or useful. Writing papers was the absolute worst - despite both of my papers going through with only minor revisions, the stress was almost unbearable. I'm regularly praised for my progress and yet I don't feel like I'm productive at all - I rarely do more than 35 hours a week and a lot of that feels unproductive and distracted, which makes me even more convinced that I'm producing nonsense. And yet, despite not actually working very much, my work still feels like it's taking over my life and I probably spend as much time worrying about my work as actually doing it. 

This is made worse by anxiety about the future. I have few connections in my field because what I'm doing is a totally new direction for my research group. I've always been very independent so persuading my supervisor (who I have a long and good working relationship with) to agree to supervise a project that nobody at my university has direct expertise in sounded fine at the time, but I've now realised how isolated I am. I have a co-supervisor who is more experienced in this field but he is halfway across the world and can be challenging to deal with. I've also become disillusioned with my specialism (numerical modelling) and increasingly interested in observational oceanography, but I have even _fewer_ connections with that area. And of course, academia is one of the most absurdly competitive professions in existence.

So I'm now here, feeling like running away after my PhD. I joked for a long time about running away to another country and starting a farm but things have now got so ridiculous that I'm finding myself thinking that this is a great idea. I just don't see how I can cope with an academic career when I've been so privileged and have had such an easy ride and can't even cope with that. I love the ocean and science and could not imagine doing work that isn't related to the marine environment, but the path that I'm on feels unsustainable. In my head I've already borderline given up but I haven't got a Plan B and haven't got a clue what that Plan B could be because I have no connections outside of academia and not doing something related to environmental/marine science isn't something I could fathom. I'm also pretty desperate to work abroad and I'm very aware that postdocs would be a very good way of doing that. 

I do not know what to do and haven't got a well-framed question to ask here. I know that this looks like a mental health carcrash and it sort of is, but I've had professional help for most of my life so there's not much else I can do about that. I don't know whether I should just give up and try to find something else to spend my life on (god knows how/what). Or part of me wonders if this is just burnout from some combination of never having left the school system and seeing my entire value as a human being as being my science. If anybody has felt something similar or has advice on how to get out of this mess, it would be greatly appreciated.",1,2020-07-06 18:04:35,AskAcademia

My boss is a great scientist, but she is very demanding. My long hours aren't enough for her, and even though I have succeeded in getting several critical experiments to work that three other PhD scientists failed at in our lab, I get the feeling she thinks that I am lazy.

jhg8tf,style_less,t2_lg8api1,Was unintentionally academically dishonest and I don't know what to do,"Hi, guys. First off, thank you for stopping by to read this. I really appreciate it.

So, this semester has been extremely hard for me. I'm currently a second-year student (undergrad), and my mental health has just gone to absolute shit. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for the year and a half that I've been here; I developed an eating disorder and have continuously been losing weight, to the point where I'm now borderline underweight; my swim coach potentially exposed me and my teammates to COVID; my hair has been falling out due to stress and a lack of food; I'm currently in the process of transferring schools; and my grandad recently passed away. It's just not been great, and I'm finishing the semester from home so that I can recover from this all.

To top it all off, my physics professor told me I was academically dishonest on a recent in-class assignment. 

I went home last weekend for my grandad's burial, and I realized while I was gone that I'd missed a problem exercise (a question we have to solve in class). I panicked and didn't want a 0 to hurt my grade, so I texted a classmate and asked if she could put my name on their group's sheet so that I could get some credit for it. She said yes, and now here we are. 

The thought literally never crossed my mind that that would be cheating, and I wasn't aware of the class policies for making up work like that. I also didn't have the forethought to tell my professor that I'd be gone--I was just so overloaded with emotions and stress at that point that I just wanted to go home. 

I admit that I did something wrong, yes.

jg3rbp,trashybarbie,t2_d2rjn1y,A fall from the ivory tower: a story of how the academic system will work you and a call for change,"I'm not really asking, I guess I'm telling. I haven't ever really TOLD my story, but I feel the need to purge.  reddit, in a sick way, is a home to me, so here goes...

&amp;#x200B;

Almost every call I have with one of my friends nowadays ends up in the same place, devolving into a conversation about my job: that fundamentally I’m not happy anymore. I’m a postdoctoral researcher.  I live in one of the most romantic European cities, and have lived in several others, have a passport full of visas and a Google Scholar page full of publications. On the outside, this may sound glamorous, but from the inside looking out, it is lonely, cold, and redundant. I’d like to put a date to when these feelings started, but there has been a slow and steady tsunami of disinterest evolving into sheer contempt for what I do.  

It is highly possibly it started with the suicide of my late husband. After someone dies from suicide, everyone tells their survivors not to place blame, but when some is both the perpetrator and victim of their own death, only Budda could avoid asking the question of ‘why?’  Since I had left my late husband, let’s call him Bob, several months before he made his choice to take his life, certainly I spent a lot of time blaming myself, but that story is for another day. The autumn before he took his life, Bob had his funding withdrawn by the University because his PhD was taking too long.  His advisors had requested he change the foundation of his dissertation work from an experiment to a survey and then back to an experiment, all the while he was required to continue teaching classes to maintain his salary and fees. Bob loved his research, but I watched his interest and motivation wane.  What used to be hours spent on what he called “dissertating” turned into hours of reading about conspiracy theories and playing video games, a notable avoidance of his work. I did not anticipate that this was a path I would come to follow.  
After he died, I promised myself that I would not let his death prevent me from finishing my PhD.  I withdrew socially, for a time being, but continued to teach, had several publications, finished my PhD on time ,and found a postdoc in another country.  I considered myself a success, despite immense adversity. I never talked about what happened in a professional space or really once I came to Europe, I wanted to be separate from the trauma of my past, and accomplish great things in the academic world.  

I was so desperate to leave the past behind that I had decided my priority was to leave the US.  The postdoc opportunity itself seemed secondary to highly reputable institutions where Einstein roamed the halls and the exquisite backdrops of Parisian blue roofs, the Alps, and the French Riviera. Little did I know that Paris is a cold and indifferent city, where particularly without speaking French, loneliness is the first friend you will make.  My position was somewhat unique in that my academic advisors were located in Zurich and the French Riviera; and I actually worked with no one from my institute. 

As an act of service, a researcher at another institute in Paris allowed me to come to their meetings once a week. However, he seemingly preferred to spend time with me as a drinking partner; where one he informed me that based on my lack of interactions in his lab group’s meetings and since seeing me at a conference the year prior I had “lost my spark.” 

This comment offended me deeply. This person didn’t know me.  They never took the time to talk with me about my research, but had some expectation of what constitutes a “spark” based on how I interact with their research group about their research -- a topic which was almost entirely new to me. Although, in some regard, he was right. The project I was working on was completely contrived by my supervisor; any ideas I had were drowned out by micromanagement. What I had loved about research was stretching ideas, but my ideas now were muted. I was starting to forgot how to think critically, and the research I was doing I found utterly meaningless. The research was based deeply in empiricism, which I am not fond of in principle and should have worked to separate myself from.  The results were also tenable; for example, changing the dataset only slightly, could produce vastly different results.  

At this point, I was essentially floating around Paris, meeting with scientists in my field when I could to stay minimally engaged in my field, occasionally going to Zurich for a month or so to work with my academic advisor. My greatest solace was the friendship of a Swedish economist I’d met through reddit, who was the greatest godsend. She and I suffered through Parisian expatriatism together with the greatest delight, that it actually made Paris quite enjoyable. 

Because of my lack of connection to any research body in Paris, my supervisors offered to move me in my second year down to the French Riviera. It was my favorite place I have ever lived.  I came in with a renewed sense of confidence, hoping that I could really make a home for myself.  Feeling a bit lackluster about the project I was assigned and following advice I’d found online for disillusioned postdocs, I decided in order to revive my so-called “spark”, I should work on something that I truly enjoyed. So, I continued to delve into something I started during my PhD, and published a paper on it, as a single author. I had informed my supervisors I was working on this, for which I had their approval, but when it was actually published was when the other shoe dropped.  

I won’t go into the details, but the relationship with my supervisors dissolved completely. Largely unrelated to the project I was working on, or the paper I’d published, I was accused of lying, stealing ideas, a lack of professionalism, being a “princess” and a “child.” Once, when my contract was coming to an end and I had an interview, which conflicted with a trip to Zurich for my job. After seeking advice from my advisor in Zurich about what to do about my interview -- also given that coronavirus was on the rise, without my consent, she cancelled my trip there and the other advisor scolded me for it. I was being bullied from both sides, I could do nothing right.  Then, the kinder of my two advisors came down with coronavirus.  I was left with one advisor, who literally has a nationwide reputation for bullying.  At her current institution, her last three female PhD students did not finish. Most of her other students do not  wish to stay in academia. After working solely under her supervision, I see why. Her comments were not about my work itself, but about me as a human being. In comments on manuscripts she would ask me what was wrong with *me --* not to see an error that was in fact not so evident.  She even corrected my English incorrectly, which is ironic, given that she is a head editor in a top journal in my field. 

Socially, again I retreated, which must be a coping mechanism, but it also happened to correspond with Coronavirus. My confidence began to fizzle once again and doing work was worse than pulling teeth. I used to envision myself as a mentor to students, pursuing research about a growing mountain of ideas I had, but this idea becomes increasingly hard to conjure as time goes on. Miraculously, I found another position with a fantastic supervisor and research group in another city in Europe, but I’m afraid I’ve burned up. The version of me that wrote Marie-Curie proposals and papers for fun has vanished. Despite a much kinder boss and involved and enthusiastic colleagues, I can’t bring myself to open a terminal window, or read a paper. I’d much rather write about what I’ve been through, because I know that Bob and I are not alone. Instead now, I see myself speaking about my experience. So many years of being afraid to share my experience, thinking it would help me to succeed in the world of academia has finally made me want to leave it. I don’t know what I want to do, perhaps become a mental health advocate.

The bottom line is that academia is an exceedingly stressful environment. I see people, including myself, retweet positions for PhDs, and I want to say, side effects may include: anxiety, depression, self-sacrifice, loneliness, lack of stability, career uncertainty, and a systemic lack of support, godspeed to those who try. Academia is not for the faint of heart, even for the strong, it requires an enduring support network (even if not nuclear, extended), an unwavering passion for what you do (which I think sometimes cannot be determined when you are doing a PhD), and a good hold on how to maintain your mental health. 

I am just one voice of many, but I am calling for change. Somehow there are oceans of money for armies of PhD students and postdocs, who are routinely underpaid.  These same graduates have a scarcity of jobs. Let’s systematically reallocate funding for fewer PhD students and postdocs, and make more permanent positions; this can even pave the way for more a more diverse populus to occupy these roles. Professors and researchers in tenured positions need to challenge bullies, not condone their behavior; or an external system who can do more than an ombudsman needs to be put in place in every academic department. The system needs reworking, not more PhD students.",1,2020-10-22 17:07:31,AskAcademia
je2m4m,rugoutfromunderme,t2_5l4g4npk,Grad students making our plan Bs - is there space for people like us in academia?,"I'm a 6th year PhD student in a social science department at an institution where it generally takes 8+ years to finish. It's the/one of the top departments in the field. It seems like all of my colleagues are talking about getting out of academia in recent months, no doubt in part due to grim expectations for the job market and possibly also in part based on personal reflection/reprioritization during the pandemic. People who I never, ever expected to leave academia are actively making plans to go. It is sometimes quite sad to me that some of these friends are planning to leave; they are so talented and good at what they do, and their work is important. But they, and I, are considering leaving for two reasons:

1) the job market is insanely competitive and for many people it means 5+ years of prioritizing nothing but work to constantly apply for jobs and move around for various VAPs and post docs before maybe getting a tenure track position, if you are lucky

2) the toxic work culture of academia is unsustainable and not what we want from our lives. I'm talking about the workaholism, publish-or-perish, performative humblebragging about how much one works, the tenure clock, and like i said before - having to be willing to move anywhere in the country/world at the expense of our personal lives and often mental health, sometimes constantly for years.

What I want to know is - - is there space in academia anymore for people who want to work reasonable hours (I mean like 9-6 M-F most of the time)? For people who need to have other things going on that is not work, for people who know they need to rest and do so? I honestly cannot tell at this point. I look at my advisor and the profs in our department and most of them are responding to emails at night and on weekends and just constantly in a frenzy. I imagine that people like me get out-competed by people who just love to work all the time (yes, I know this is unhealthy/unproductive for most people but there are some who just love to work and only work and don't really experience negative results) - - or by super competitive people who are maybe less balanced but are driven to collect everything they can on their CVs. I have done well for myself as a grad student so far, but I value my work flexibility and taking down time when I need it.

Social sciences/humanities colleagues who have been on the job market in recent years - what is your perception? Are there new hires out there who do successfully create work/life balance who are not culled when it comes time to get tenure? Will things be even more cutthroat in a post-covid world? If one needs something like a 9-5ish job to feel like a human being, is it worth trying to stay in academia at all?",1,2020-10-19 14:27:24,AskAcademia

Im a STEM major (biology) senior undergrad student, and Im not sure how valuable I will look to grad schools if I drop my Environmental Studies minor. However, my other option is possibly tanking my GPA. Sorry for the formal- i’m on mobile... *collective, annoyed groan*

 So, I’m in physics 2 right now, however, some very intense family problems have come up (I’m talking immediate family, terminal illness problems) and suddenly I can barely focus anymore. I wasnt doing amazing in the first place, mind you, but I’ve recently gotten into therapy and i’m *trying* to get my mental health back to a good place. However, i’m on track to get a C in physics. I bombed my first two exams and, admittedly, I did not study enough, but I definitely put myself in a place of major, debilitating stress the week before. My prof told me the only way I could fail the class is if I do even worse on my exams (very unlikely), but the only way I could get to a high B is if I do really, really well (also unlikely). It’s near impossible, actually, because not only would I have to change up my already stressful studying habits, but I would also have to relearn everything for the cumulative final. I want to drop the class and take it again next semester. 

So this is where the issue lies. If I drop the class, due to complete fucking stupidity on my part, I will have to drop my environmental science minor in order to fit physics into my schedule next semester. I am a biology major who no longer plans on med school- I want to go into environmental law or research on aquatic systems/ possibly research in ecology. 

Would I be completely fucked if I dropped my minor? I’m not super worried about the W on my transcript if I dropped physics because, honestly, the circumstances of this shitty year would make it hard for anyone to judge me on that, but I’m not sure if they would be as lenient on me being a regular old average biology major... Or if it would be even worse if my GPA were to be tanked even more by a C in physics. This is the cause of a lot of stress for me, so if anyone could possibly help me I would really appreciate it.",1,2020-10-15 15:42:11,AskAcademia

I am a business student with strategy as my major. I find the concepts intriguing and interesting, but reading through the papers feel completely impossible to me. I am linguistically strong compared to my peers, but the reading itself just feels like banging my head against a brick wall, and what I thought was a decent English vocabulary seems to be completely in my own head. I have a midterm exam in approximately a week, and I need to recap 27 papers in that timespan, while simultaneously working on my other classes. I have paid attention in class, and I feel like I have an okay grasp of the concepts, but when I'm trying to read I just get overwhelmed.

I can get through one sentence, and suddenly I catch myself drifting off, and I need to go back. The jargon used in these articles seems unnecessarily complicated and hard to understand, and I drift off because I can't keep my focus due to the articles being written the way they are. I'm not blaming the authors nor the academic circles responsible for the research at all, but rather my own head and its inability to sit out long and complicated pieces of literature.

This has become somewhat of a bad spiral, as it stresses me out to no end that I'm not mastering it, which leads to me putting it off, which leads to stress, which further deprecates my learning. I'm completely lost, and I feel like I might implode soon if I don't crack the code. If anyone of you have some advice for me on how to tackle a) the papers at the best possible way to learn (or memorize if that is all I have time for), and b) manage the stress that comes with it.

Hope this is an OK place to ask.

I’m a 25 year old woman in Copenhagen, Denmark, and I’m currently doing my master’s degree in law school (at University of Copenhagen) and doing an AI course as my last elective course.

I wish to work in a game changing/revolutionary field and to shape the laws and policies of the future. I am interested in making a PhD project with futuristic relevance and of practical use – not “zero-research project” that will collect dust.

I’m thinking that several papers would be a good fit for this AI course, rather than a book/monograph.

I like researching things and would like to make an impact in the AI-legal field – and I have an excellent professor/possible PhD supervisor, who is super engaged/enthusiastic, intelligent and creative (I’ve heard this is important when making such a project).

I am already thinking of doing my master’s thesis in this course, so I will be working more with this professor than I have with other ones.  
 

**Here are my PhD questions and concerns:**

1. Is it a good idea with regards to the job market to do a PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Legal Disruption/AI/RoboLaw? (Course description: [https://kurser.ku.dk/course/jjua55235u/2020-2021](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/jjua55235u/2020-2021)). Is it “too new”, or is it a growing pioneer field?
2. Can a PhD help me with regards to shaping future laws and policies? Would I be able to achieve the same in the labor market in terms of influence on legislative work?
3. How many hours a week do you put into it? How is your mental health and social/family life? Do you have a job on the side?
4. Is it difficult to get financial support for a PhD? Here in Denmark it costs around 217.000 DKK to do a PhD.
5. Is it difficult to suddenly have to be a teacher/researcher without having done it prior to a PhD? Did you feel a bit “lost” at the beginning?
6. Is it possible to get into a PhD programme if you have sort of average grades, but a very good project and motivation/“fit”?
7. Would you call a PhD an “outdated, expensive pyramid scheme to please professors’ egos” as one of my friends has called it? (I try to hear all sides before making a decision).
8. Is 25-26 years old seemingly “too old” of an age to start a PhD? I’ve also heard this from some people. I don't think it's true, though.
9. Can you modify the project as you go along? How much can you modify it?

1) How do I write the introduction? Considering the literature review has to be around 600 words only, I want to keep my introduction as concise as possible. Do I introduce my sources and briefly summarize their findings in the introduction? Or should I just stick to introducing the topic itself?

2) Do I critically examine each source individually **or** do I examine the topic with help of the sources, like a mixed bag, criticizing the sources while doing so?

3) Any tips on writing a literature review this short, in general? It is possible to stretch the word count to 700-800 words (which I will probably do), but even then it is still on the short side IMO.

But, this early in my career, I am already finding it extraordinarily hard to keep a balance between things that keep me centered, calm, connected, etc. and school, which will soon be work. I am assuming it will only get worse from here, this being the junior level in my education.

The above is really important to me, living as much as I can in the present has been really significant in mainting my mental health. But, the work is also important to me, it's the most at home I've felt in any professional environment. But it just causes one to be so busy - I don't have time for the things that used to keep me centered, calm, etc. I'm getting the sense that I'm engaged with two opposing outlooks (happiness comes from being calm, finding peace vs. happiness comes from knowledge, you must dedicate yourself to its pursuit)

So I'm wondering how people have balanced non-achievement-centric notions of happiness/fulfilment with work in academia. Can the two co-exist.

Btw, I am not seeking ""if the work isn't fulfilment on its own, it's not for you"" type answers. I disagree fundamentally with the notion that any work can be fulfilment on its own to quite the level I am referring to. To the degree to which it can, it certainly is for me.

I have a place in a PhD programme in Singapore that doesn’t appear to be valued very highly anywhere.

I second guess whether the clinical aspect about interacting with patients is suitable for me which is obviously the most important part. Most significantly, I really started second guessing myself during COVID-19 as I don’t see myself as some kind of hero that sacrifices themselves to save lives and started feeling scared, not excited about running to the hospital to help in every way I could.

I will try to keep this post as brief as possible because it is probably a busy time for most folks at this point in the semester. Basically, a cohort member in my year was recently absent for about three weeks due to mental health issues and a particular lab related incident with his advisor among other things. I recently saw this cohort member attend class remotely (my campus is one of those that lets people choose online or in person) without the camera on and had considered a possible ""welcome back"" message of sorts to them (singular ""they"" to keep gender anonymous). However, I am uncertain whether or not that would be the professional thing to do and if that sort of message would, even on a personal level, be considered acceptable because it would otherwise bring indirect attention to something they (singular) may otherwise wish to put aside. 

Another variable in all of this is that incident that spurred their mental health issues does (unfortunately) involve another person in my year as well and there is definitely a burned bridge with that particular member. In addition, this is our first semester in the program. I am worried that reaching out may affect ""diplomacy"" with this other cohort member if I do so.

g70yo6,mk_barrick,t2_2ndguhwd,Recruitment for Online Study - Social Sciences [Communication],"Hello, 

I hope everyone is doing well during the quarantine/shelter-in-place. I know how difficult this time can be due to the rapid change to online classes and teaching. 

This year, I am conducting a senior thesis concerning mental health and communication. In light of recent events, there has been a lot of up and downs with students continuing their projects. 

My study happens to be online already, but the recruitment process has proven difficult. We usually have a pool of participants associated with the university; however, communicating with that organization has not been the easiest feat with the department also having to accommodate for COVID-19. 

My study is examining college students (ages approx. 18-25) and my study has been approved by my institution's IRB. I do not believe that I can recruit using mTurk because I need a student population. Does anyone have any recommendations for methods or software of recruiting participants during the time of COVID-19. 

tl; dr: The pandemic has made recruitment of participants for my survey difficult. Are there are recommendations for software or methods that could help me recruit college students for a questionnaire. 


Thanks again for your time and attention to this matter. I hope everyone's classes are going well.",1,2020-04-24 03:20:12,AskAcademia
fgu2vn,Wavedeli,t2_2wx04u66,Research Lab Advice? Feeling Stuck,"Hello all,

I am a female sophomore student studying Computer Science at a US state university. I'm looking for advice regarding how I should move forward with research in my next few years of college.

I have been involved in research since last summer, and I largely enjoy the process as someone who loves to learn. I have been in two labs; although I was making considerable progress and producing viable data while working with the first lab, I ultimately decided to transfer to my current lab because I thought their work aligned better with my future career interests and the work environment was better (I would have someone to shadow; in my first lab, the only person I worked with was my professor, and he was mostly absent since he was busy). However, I'm not so sure if I should stay anymore. What I am trying to figure out is whether I am truly disinterested in the topic, or if it's more due to my experience with this lab so far that has both failed to meet my personal expectations and expectations that any researcher would have.

*(\*Note: I have a TL;DR at the end in case you'd like a summary instead)*

I'd like to point out before I go on that I am not intentionally ""research lab hopping"" for more letters of recommendation. In fact, it's quite the opposite--I wish I could find and stay with the ""right"" lab because it is time consuming to become trained for and accustomed to different research. I'm more concerned with finding the right fit in terms of career interests because I intend to go on to graduate school and I'm still trying to figure out what I'd like to specialize in. ""PI/lab personality"" matches are also important for me to ensure I'll work well and effectively with my PI and fellow lab members. On the other hand, I feel that, from what I've read on academic Reddit forums, to find an almost perfect match is to strike gold in our current academic environment, so maybe this is all wishful thinking.

**Reasons for Wanting to Leave:** (not exhaustive; just a few reasons) 

1. I don't feel like a valued member of the research lab. When I first joined the lab, I wanted to become more involved right away in not just their research endeavors, but also their community outreach events, so I offered to assist even though it meant going out of my way (it wasn't great timing because I had a narrow window between classes). I showed up early, as my PI requested, to get trained with the equipment, but they ran out of time to train me and then told me they didn't need my help anymore. I even asked if I could help relocate equipment for them, but they made it clear they didn't need help. There are other times in which I was asked to help, showed up, did some work, but was dismissed in the end (I won't talk about them in detail to avoid revealing my identity). I realize that these events are important for our lab because they are crucial chances to showcase our work and potentially receive grant funding or attention from companies for partnerships, but if our PI and more experienced lab members are never going to allow newer members a chance to help (and maybe make small mistakes because that is a part of the learning process), how can we become better researchers? It makes me feel devalued and discouraged, and moreover, like dead weight.
2. There aren't many opportunities for me to get my questions answered without a short reply of ""look it up on Google"" or ""ask your partner."" To provide some context, I'm one of those students who rarely asks questions without first trying on my own and researching online. At this point, I still don't necessarily have the background knowledge to understand some of the articles/forums I find, which is when I ask questions toward my partner, and then PI. Unfortunately, my partner is currently a senior undergrad, so although he has a little more experience than I do, most of the time he also does not know the answer--and I don't expect him to because he is not a graduate student. When I ask my PI, he tells me to ask my partner to show or explain to me. I feel stuck because I cannot flat out tell my PI that my partner isn't always helpful because it would be throwing him under the bus when he hasn't necessarily done anything wrong. Considering that I left the first lab for a better ""support system"" in which I could work under a more experienced student, this frustrates me a lot.
3. This one is connected to point #2. My PI gets visibly frustrated and upset when my partner and/or I do not understand something, so now both of us are sometimes scared to ask for help. We know that our PI is hard on his students, but some encouragement (not necessarily the hand-holding kind) would be more beneficial as an unsure researcher. Sometimes I feel that he's disappointed in me or that he doesn't like me, but of course, I don't think that's necessarily true. I'd just rather be in a more nurturing environment where I don't need to constantly question his opinion of me. 
4. My workspace isn't the most ideal. I'm usually required to sit on the ground for hours, which hurts my back. The space is really small, so we can't arrange for alternative seating. My alternative workspace is not in the same building, so I can't do substantial work there.
5. My research has been going slowly, and my PI also pointed it out. I realize that research is supposed to be slow, but my progress almost makes me feel like I'm not cut out for this specific research topic (\*cue impostor syndrome\*), especially compared to the progress I made on the other research project over the summer. However, I need to put this into perspective because during the summer, I was working 40 hrs/week, and I've only been able to dedicate &lt;7 hrs/week during the school year toward this project.
6. I still haven't received sufficient onboarding training specific to my project. My PI sends broader information for all his students at the lab to review, but none of it is specific to my project, so I need to look to Google for help.
7. While our projects are practical, I feel that the work that I do won't impact as many people as I'd prefer. It's not to say that I think my lab's work is superfluous, it's more that our lab's mission doesn't align exactly with my personal goals. I want to feel that I'm doing as much good as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I Would Stay:**

* PI is empathetic toward students. He recognizes the importance of mental health and encourages students to occasionally take time off for self-care. This is important for me because I do have pre-existing mental health issues, and his attitude makes me feel safer in our lab environment. I know that some professors don't necessarily hold the same beliefs, and I'm just a little tired of having to figure that out the hard way.
* His lab is a great way for me to combine my interdisciplinary interests, which is why I joined in the first place. However, I just don't know if this is the right lab to explore those interests anymore.
* PI is willing to fund my research work so I don't need to look for an additional job. I can focus on research.
* I'm anxious about finding a new lab. The professors that I did enjoy taking courses with are not in my major. It's not to say that I didn't enjoy my major-specific courses; it's more that they work with a different topic of interest within CS. If I cold-email professors just based on their research, I might end up with a professor that might be an even worse fit. Professors are also busy, so contacting them and looking for a new lab might take a long time. Staying with my current lab would work incredibly well with my personal timeline for beginning my thesis this Fall.   
Alternatively, I could ask to rejoin my first lab, but I don't think that will work, and it's not a lab environment I would want to work long-term in despite the progress I had.

&amp;#x200B;

***TL;DR:*** *I'm currently in a relatively ideal research lab environment, but I'm finding that I starting to lose interest in the research that we do. Not sure if this is because I am truly disinterested in the topic, or more because my experiences working with some of the lab members (including PI) has diminished my overall interest. I think it's definitely a mix of both. Should I stay, or should I look for a new lab that may end up to be an even worse fit with less benefits?*

&amp;#x200B;

If I stay with my current lab, I could suggest for a new project to work on, but I wouldn't even know where to begin searching for new ideas. Additionally, how would you suggest I discuss with my PI about my concerns?

&amp;#x200B;

 I would appreciate any advice! Thank you in advance, and for reading this far (if you did).",1,2020-03-11 08:47:56,AskAcademia

aouveb,brownidegurl,t2_7gmob,Path to FT composition teaching without PhD? Help me weigh options.,"I've taught college-level writing for 8 years, and I know I want to do this work long-term. I have explored non-teaching academic work (advising, teaching-learning centers, scholarship coaching/writing) and none of it interests me unless it's in the classroom, student-facing. 

I think a CC or SLAC is the right place for me, but I'm at a professional crossroads and the best path is unclear. While there are no right answers, I'd appreciate any advice. Thank you for reading.

**Me:** I'm 32, healthy, and realistic about the bleak state of academia yet naively determined to stay and improve things. My husband has a lucrative tech job, and is open to relocating as long as he can find work. We'd like to have kids someday, but it's not urgent; we'd like to adopt.

**Background:** I earned a fiction MFA in 2014 from a once well-regarded but becoming-defunct state school program. During the program, I quickly discovered that I enjoyed teaching more than writing, so I graduated with nothing published and a mediocre thesis novella. Still, I worked hard, added value to the program, and formed strong relationships with advisors and mentors. The 2/2 load also gave me 3 years of teaching experience, which helped me land my first adjunct gig after graduation.

**Teaching experience:** I've full-time adjuncted first-year writing, first-year seminars (writing-related), and upper-level professional writing at several colleges (state, private, CC) 2014-2018, in addition to tutoring at the CC writing center. I'm good at what I do; my classes fill quickly and both peers and superiors are impressed by my teaching skills and professionalism. I'd also say I'm competitive, at least locally. Shortly after I took the below job, the staff director at my CC writing center offered me his job, but I declined because it doesn't involve teaching and I'm not really interested in WC work.

**Now:** In 2018, I began a hybrid writing center administrative assistant/teaching staff role--a colleague recently became the director, and encouraged me to apply. 

This role has great opportunities. I'm gaining new skills (managing/interviewing/hiring the WC's peer tutors, assisting the English Department chair with revamping the first-year writing program in preparation for reaccreditation in 2021, designing/facilitating an accompanying faculty training, etc.) and I get to teach.

However, this school doesn't feel like home. It's a religious institution, and I don't share its conservative values. Moreover, my salary is low enough that I'm still adjuncting to make ends meet, which is tough on top of full-time hours. The department chair, my director, and my faculty mentor know my current role isn't a good long-term fit.

**So, where do I go? Options:**

**Get FT where I am now, and use the title to leverage another FT job at a better school.** 

* *Pros:* The chair has stated repeatedly that he'd like to hire me as full-time TT so I don't abandon ship. Although he can't conjure the salary line, I think the offer is sincere--this school is small, with a proven record of hiring/promoting from within (I've seen several such promotions in my short time here, including the president.) He's assured me that I don't need a PhD, and that my MFA is a terminal degree.

* *Cons:* Perhaps this strategy isn't viable. Also, getting FT only to leave is unkind, and the position may never open. There's one FT English faculty member of retiring age, but it's not certain he's going anywhere.

**Get a PhD and cross my fingers.**

* *Pros:* A PhD (probably in Rhet Comp) will make me a more competitive, conventional applicant. I took a Rhet Comp research methodology class during my MFA and really enjoyed it. Provided my research could directly help students and teachers, I think I could survive a PhD.

* *Cons:* I'm deeply ambivalent about getting a PhD. I like research for its potential to reveal new truths and help people, but I don't enjoy writing lit reviews, the pressure of publishing, or the rat race of conferences, networking, etc. The stories I've heard about academic hazing frighten me, and I'm still sitting on $35k of debt from my MFA. This sub advises people *AGAINST* getting a PhD with the expectation of a job, and that's exactly what I'd be doing. I know colleagues who got PhDs only to end up exactly where I already am--lecturing for $40k/year, NTT. Finally, I'm just not sure I want to work that hard. I like spending time with my husband, going to the gym every day, and my mental health. Although my husband supports my goals, my steely devotion to full-time adjuncting the past 4 years has been rough on us, both emotionally and financially. Even the paltry stability of my current full-time role has been a game-changer, and I'm hesitant to throw that away for 5-7 years of god knows what.


**Don't get a PhD, and wiggle into a FT lecture, staff, or admin-with-teaching role.** 

* *Pros:* I'm actually happy doing half-admin, half-teaching right now. Challenges are within reach, my schedule is flexible, and I can prioritize teaching. Maybe I'd be happiest finagling myself into a better version of what I'm already doing.

* *Cons:* These positions are rare and the pay may always suck.

**Publish something and try a more traditional creative writing route.**

* *Pros:* Colleagues of mine who've published even modestly successful books have gotten FT TT jobs.

* *Cons:* My MFA cured me of the desire to write; I have no idea where to start. I love books and stories but abhor the ""writing community"" and its pretension. Also, the aforementioned colleagues are teaching in rural places, where my husband is unlikely to find work.

**Return to adjuncting, but seek stable part-time work.**

* *Pros:* I have MFA acquaintances who spend half their time freelance writing/editing and the other half writing. A sustainable side gig would allow me to adjunct long-term. I enjoyed many things about adjuncting--the freedom, the flexibility, and the escape from faculty drama. And if the pattern of downsizing and budget cuts in academia continues, I know I'll always be able to find work!

* *Cons:* I'd miss my faculty colleagues and being a part of the university community. Although some colleges where I've adjuncted made an effort to involve/respect me, I could never escape the paradox: Adjuncts are both wildly valuable and totally worthless. Faculty have treated me like a queen when they needed last-minute courses taught, only to drop me without a word next term. Accepting that I'm a subhuman cog for someone's machine is a mindfuck, and voluntarily objectifying myself requires toxic mental acrobatics and a taste for masochism. 


What do you think? What am I not considering?

apvdix,harassDoc,t2_37ki4h7n,Sexually harassed by postdoc supervisor and forced to quit.,"I was forced to resign from a postdoctoral position in a major research institute in the US after being sexual harassed by my postdoc supervisor. It's been 4 months since I resigned, but I'm still struggling to move on from what happened.

It started a couple of months into my postdoc. He started leering and staring at me in public and moving too close to me during one-on-one meetings. At one point, I moved away from him slightly when he started getting too close, which made him really angry. I also tried to keep the door open when we have our one-on-one meetings which made him so angry that he started criticizing my work in a loud voice. He also made everyone believe there was something going on between us. I stopped talking to him during social gatherings and generally stayed away from him. He also started bullying me and putting down my suggesting during group meetings. It effected my self-esteem so much that I stopped speaking up in meetings altogether. He brought up my lack of participation in meetings during a progress review. I made excellent progress at the beginning of my postdoc and had my first manuscript ready in a matter of months. But after the harassment started, I got so depressed that I couldn't focus on my work and my progress suffered.

After putting up with his abuse for over a year, I reached my breaking point when he invited me to go to a conference with him. It was a small conference with several interesting talks, but it was on the other side of the country and there was hardly anyone I knew attending it. So I didn't want to take the risk. I made an excuse about a prior commitment, but he didn't buy it. He got angry and started to bully and harass me even more. I was so depressed at this point that I tried to commit suicide. After several days in the ICU and a week in the hospital, I recovered, at least physically. I went back to work a week later. I didn't tell anyone what happened, but my postdoc supervisor made it clear that he knew. He mentioned in passing that he has access to anyone's medical record, and in another instance, made a snide comment about me trying to kill myself for my work.

I handed in my resignation a couple of months after this. I wasn't in a place to apply for jobs let alone go for interviews while I was there. So I quit without having a job lined up. I also started seeing a therapist around this time and I think my mental health has somewhat improved since then. However, I'm still so traumatized by this whole experience that I can't seem to bring myself to apply for jobs. Every time I see a job I could apply to, I get paralyzed with fear that the same thing will happen. How do I move on from this and go back to work?

a2xk4m,FickleJackfruit5,t2_2pw2g4v4,Should I disclose my mental health and family struggles in my letter of interest?,"TLDR: I graduated from my undergrad in 2017 and I want to apply for grad school. Should I disclose my unique family circumstances and history of mental illness in my application? They affected my school performance and extracurricular, but I don't want to be penalized for my experiences or to come across like they're excuses. 

I graduated from an interdisciplinary science program at a Canadian university in 2017. I want to return to school in the next 2 years, in the field of Political Ecology/Environmental Studies, and already I'm concerned about writing my application.

I have a unique family history: in ninth grade my father's psychiatrist rapidly changed his medications and induced a psychotic break which landed my dad in the hospital and then the following year my mother was beaten (nearly to death) by the police in my hometown. We didn't have close family to support us, so needless to say both these events had an immense toll of my life and my health. My mother has severe PTSD and, although I haven't been properly diagnosed, my counsellor thinks I do too. 

When I went away to university I began having panic attacks, symptoms of depression and other mental health challenges. I found an extraordinary program I loved, but I definitely withheld and isolated myself. I wasn't involved in extracurriculars and volunteer work the way I had been in high school. My grades weren't terrible but they weren't great either (B+ average). Overall my life was characterized by fear, though I didn't understand that at the time, predominately due to the stigma surrounding both experiences (i.e. severe mental health problems and police brutality). 

Fast forward to now, I've been out of school for about 1.5 years and I'm considering applying to grad school. I always intended to pursue my Masters, but I decided I needed some time first. I've had an incredible job and work environment since I graduated, and it's helped me develop a healthy lifestyle and routine. I am better at taking care of myself, respecting my boundaries and managing my time. Still I am worried about not having a robust enough academic average or application overall. I've broken it down into two chunks: 

\- I'm having a hard time assessing my academic experiences. My grades weren't spectacular and I didn't do co-op or much volunteering in the field I'm interested in. Still I did work as a research assistant for a respected prof in Geography (if the paper is accepted I'll have a co-author credit), worked on a 40-page team capstone research project, and turned a research project into a mixed-media gallery piece, per the advice of my prof. Still I don't know if this is enough to make up for my not-excellent average. 

\- Additionally I'm unsure whether or not, and to what extent, to disclose my family experiences. On the one hand they affected me and my work capacity profoundly, and I'd like to give an explanation for a) not being more involved and b) not going straight to grad school so I don't appear lazy/unengaged. I've worked really hard to unlearn my unhealthy coping habits and I do think I'd do better in a Masters program than I did my undergrad. Pragmatically however I don't know what to disclose or whether any disclosure might be weighed against me, either as indicative that I wouldn't work hard or read as an excuse for poor work ethic etc. I don't think I actually have a poor work ethic, I have a skewed perception of my capabilities and talents. 

I know my situation is unique, but if anyone can help me de-tangle this mess I'd be so appreciative! Should I share my personal experiences on my application, or in emails to potential supervisors, or is that too much? ",1,2018-12-04 05:18:06,AskAcademia

I'm a current masters student finishing my degree in mental health counseling, and have a few questions. Over the past year I've been an intern working with students at a University Counseling Center. My primary role is as a therapist, but I find myself enjoying the little bit of career exploration/academic success more than traditional therapy. As a result, I've really been drawn to academic advising but am a little worried about my qualifications. 

I'm aware that some of my counseling knowledge is transferable, but unfortunately I've had little exposure to academic/career work outside of one 3-hour course and some peer advising stuff, further my only experience with student affairs/services is my internship and a few stress management/study strategies workshops I've led. 

So I guess I have a couple of questions here; 1) How competitive of a job candidate will I be right out of graduation, especially being as my background will be in counseling NOT student affairs? 2) What can I do on my own to bolster my knowledge/experience? 3) Has anyone personally made this transition or work with someone who has?

I have NO idea what I would do for work as an alternative. I can't see clearly because I'm burnt out and having a breakdown, so my brain isn't providing rational suggestions.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a junior psychology major at a prestigious R1 institution, and I'm an international student from Korea. I've been working very hard towards my goal of pursuing a PhD in clinical psychology by maintaining a good GPA and getting involved in multiple labs and research projects as a research assistant/coordinator. I have some clinical experience through a peer mental health support group as well as through one of my labs where I work with patients on the psychosis spectrum. I am due to have a couple or more posters to my name within the next year or so, and I have no doubts that I'll do pretty well in the GREs (as an Asian, standardized testing is almost like second nature to me). 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that I have been very focused and diligent thus far in my college career, and I feel very strongly about doing research in grad school. I also believe I would be a strong candidate otherwise, but I'm worried that my status as an international student might become a hindrance when I'm applying for PhD programs.

gylw3t,marblemenow1,t2_14s0t7ve,Having an existential career crisis: Academia vs Industry,"Hello!

I'm having an existential career crisis. I'm not sure whether I want to go into industry as a data scientist or go into academia as a full-time researcher or a professor.

For context, I'm an Information Science, Systems, and Technology Major with concentrations in Data Science and Behavioral Science. I'm also minoring in Science and Technology Studies and Science Communication and Public Engagement. I have research experience in data science, natural language processing in mental health, and machine learning. This summer, I'm doing research with a professor remotely in which I'm using computer vision to help blind people exercise.

I definitely want to pursue research as a career. One of my research interests is using data science to improve mental health and well-being for policy and decision making. Another one of my research interests is making technology more accessible for disabled people. However, I'm hesitant in pursuing more schooling to get a research position or a professorship.

I want to do data science because I enjoy data analysis and machine learning. It's fulfilling to do that because I want to help companies make data-influenced decisions based on data that I've collected and visualized.",1,2020-06-07 22:14:22,AskAcademia
kra63i,WaterBuffalo123456,t2_97qqq2z7,I don't know if I can do academia (or even finish my course) any more,"I'm a masters student in the first (and final) year of my program. Wasn't meant to go to this university, but couldn't go to the other one due to COVID (abroad). I have a deferred offer for the other masters program (funding dependent), and the advisor is super keen on me going, even letting me sit in on one of his remote classes this semester. But I don't have the heart to tell him that going to the other university (my current one), and the pandemic, has just ruined me. Why should I sit around studying history all day when people are dying? I feel like my work is useless, my subject is worthless, and I can't even motivate myself to write the assignments I do have, let alone apply for PhDs or funding or anything else. The only thing I've done is applied for some jobs for next year (and I'm too scared to tell the advisor on the program I am meant to be going on that I'd rather take those at this point). We had one semester on-campus and I had awful roommates and was just depressed all of the time. Now, this semester is all online, and I have zero motivation. I've wanted to get a PhD since I was really young, and I don't want to admit defeat. I just don't know how on earth to motivate myself to do work when lectures and seminars are just pre-recorded or awkward Zoom calls, and I don't even know the format of the exams I'm meant to be studying for.

a50slf,tar4ntula,t2_29zmjp5w,i'm a first-year PhD student in chemical engineering who will probably drop out within the next week. the only thing holding me back: will it be unlikely that i'll ever get accepted to another PhD program in a different field?,"this is long, but i'd appreciate having anyone offer their thoughts so much.

i'm finishing up the first semester of my PhD at a top 10 university for ChE. long story short: i don't think chemical engineering is for me. i've met with dozens of professors doing all sorts of research for chemical engineering and i haven't connected with one or found a project i like enough to establish a connection with the PI and group. many of the faculty members who topped my list of potential PIs are at another campus 4 hours away. in addition, i haven't been happy in general. my mental health has never been the greatest but this is the first time i've ever felt that a community has been unsupportive. i dealt with some setbacks at the beginning of the semester that interfered with attending class, and since then, my graduate advisor has been urging me to ""consider other options"" and that ""i act like i don't truly a PhD because i'm not showing enough interest"". i have filed disability documentation but didn't have them at the time because i'd just moved here and was trying to find new doctors. i'm guessing my professors now think this about me as well since she will send me emails to check up on me and CC them, and since they're on the committee, chances of passing my Q exam are probably pretty low. i don't think this is true, and if it it is, i don't know why i'm specifically being called out of from my 55-member class. anyway, it's definitely contributed toward my mental health worsening, and i've learned in the past that it's not worth waiting it out and seeing what will happen.

making this decision has been really rough for me because despite not enjoying my time here, i love learning and i love being in an environment that constantly gives me the opportunity to learn from experts in their fields. i've been attending many seminars in the chemistry department and even sitting in on group meetings to hear what current research is up to. my initial goal was to find a PI involved with pharmaceutical research since i've had an inkling since starting undergrad research that i'll be looking toward the pharma industry for opportunities as a research scientist. ChE does offer pharma-related research, but most of it at my school is heavily focused on the biological side of things and i've always loved chemistry more. 

the only reason i'm hesitating with officially turning in my form is because i do want to finish my PhD in the future, but in a different field such as synthetic chemistry, medicinial chemistry, or pharmaceutical sciences where i'll be involved with drug synthesis and studying their reaction mechanisms. i have my BS in chemical engineering so i'm sure i will have to take some pre-reqs (possibly at a local community college?). but realistically, i do need to take it easy for a while; the transition from undergrad directly to grad school burns a lot of people out even without my circumstances. i want to hopefully take one class next semester and after this semester's courseload, i'm honestly really excited about finally taking a chemistry class again. 

so i supposed i have a few questions: 1) i didn't receive the best grades this semester once my mental health took a nosedive. will it be difficult for me to find a well-regarded chemistry PhD program who will accept me with that on top of being a PhD dropout? 2) are there general pre-reqs that aren't specific to most schools that i should look into taking? 3) is anyone studying or performing research related to drug synthesis/pharmaceutical technology who would be willing to provide insight on what the field is like right now?",1,2018-12-10 22:54:46,AskAcademia
kc2ixx,Madison_Sue,t2_8hs6eqk9,Is it worth sending a formal request for Incomplete to the Professor? I don’t want to just give up.,"Sorry for the wall of text.

So I struggled with some mental/physical health issues this semester. Things were great for the first month and a half, then my anxiety/depression medication stopped helping. 

My doctor and I got on top of it right away, but it still took about another month and a half to change meds and adjust to them. The side effects pretty much put me on my ass for 2 weeks. 

In the middle of this time I had a meeting with some of my instructors and a “student success” administrator. I shared what I was going through and I wasn’t sure how long it would affect my class work, which they seemed understanding about. 

Fast forward, the last few weeks I have been doing better and working to get caught up. I had another meeting with one of my Professors about where I’m at with it and she said that she can’t pass me. I asked about possibly having more time but she doesn’t think that would be beneficial (not an exact quote, but close). She seemed unconcerned that without her class I can’t move on with my degree and retaking it will add a whole year to graduate. 

I would like at least the opportunity to finish my work and have it graded fairly, not just *give up* this semester/year because of my stupid mental illness. 

I WAS still able to attend all of the classes via zoom. The issue was not being able to complete the homework (because of said health issues). Each week I worked on the material we covered but was not able to spend the proper effort/time to fully finish it (so the work I need to make up is not starting at nothing). 

So, do other Professors think it would be worth sending a formal request for an Incomplete to this instructor? When I met with her before I didn’t outright ask for one but I get the sense she is someone that doesn’t really do them. Would it help if I outline a plan on making up the work and having it in before next semester starts?

- The class work is one big project we spent the entire semester putting together. There were no tests
- I also applied for student accommodations (didn’t know I qualified before yesterday)
- my doctor/therapist said they would back me with whatever is needed to help me continue 

If she doesn’t approve, would it be a bad idea to take it over her head? I don’t want to if it will make me an enemy or if I don’t meet the standards for an Incomplete.

At the end of the day I will accept the grade I get because that is the work I did. I just hope for the understanding that I could have done so much better and the chance to prove it.",1,2020-12-13 02:36:47,AskAcademia

So, my previous semester was online and it sucked. I wasn't as much as productive as I thought it would be. It was very hectic and I lost my mental health in the final days as a result of which I kind of screwed my final exams. I got free on 4th of December but ever since that I have been feeling guilty of not doing enough or learning enough in my previous semester.

 I thought I'll just revise whatever I didn't learn then or I'll just start prepping up for the next semester in the December break alongwith some pending things such as meeting up with friends/watching pending movies/getting house repaired and what not.

Turns out that I could not get anything done apart from getting the house repaired. That task was done in around a week. Rest of the time I just stayed in my room on social media and procrastinating.

Now, December is done and my classes for next semester starts tomorrow. Now, I regret about not spending enough time with my friends or family and just wasting most of December.

I've noticed that this is a cycle. This happens around every summer/winter break and the following semester.

How do I deal with or get rid of these feelings? Please Help.

I currently just graduated with a BSc in Biological Sciences from a top university in Canada. I'm looking to broaden my career opportunities by applying to a few master's programs.

I am looking for a master's program in the health industry which would land me positions with good salaries and lots of room for upward mobility.

I would love to get into a technology-related field, as I am currently learning python and SQL and have fallen into love with numbers and data as of late.

Background: 2.9 Cumulative GPA. I didn't do well in my undergrad, I started slow since a lot of family issues and having to juggle mental health, I honestly didn't care about it, but I have shown an upward trajectory maintaining a 3.5 in my last 2 years. Unfortunately, because of COVID, my last semester's grades were not taken which dropped my GPA (would have been aiming for 3.8 in the last year if not for credit/no credit rule for grading in last semester).

I am considering the following programs:

* Master's in Public Health (MPH) with a focus in health policy and management
* Masters in Health Informatics (MHI)
* Masters in Healthcare Administration

If anyone is able to share their experiences with these programs or even other programs in the health industry I am open to learning more about them.

kepf9v,Special-Ad7748,t2_95hut8d0,(Grad Student) Need help discerning the progress report of my advisors,"Hey good people of r/askacademia.

I’m a 3rd year Neuroscience grad student. Had a bad quarter. I failed my quals and had a few rounds of failed experiments. Honestly this year has been a wash. This quarter was a busy one for me. I...
1) wrote an Nrsa f31 proposal 
2) got married
3) studied for (and failed) oral quals
4) began writing a review paper on my own.

All this without a laptop, and financial and mental health struggles (been hitting up the local food bank each week but I know so many of us are in that same boat). Additionally, my family members cut me off for living with my fiancé before we got married.

Anyways it’s been a trying semester and tbh it’s taken every bit of energy I had just to hold myself together. Today my advisors were taking stock of my progress and aptitudes. They noted I have an aptitude for writing, but am not great at benchwork and my project.... well I can put all the data I have accrued from my entire PhD thus far on a single poster. They noted my habit of singularly focusing on one thing until it is finished and encouraged me to get more skilled at multitasking and working on things in parallel.

We are also scaling way back on the ambitions of my project. 

Maybe I’m a bit touchy because this quarter -and year- have been a lot, but I feel crushed, like I should master out and start a career elsewhere. I have a retake for my qualifying exam in a month and a half and the continued setbacks are draining my motivation and hopes of succeeding.

krssds,goose_talon,t2_4y430alh,Editor determines a reviewers to be unnecessarily harsh,"Hey all,

I am a recently minted PhD in organismal biology (USA). I graduated in August after having to work outrageously hard to prove myself to my absent yet hyper critical advisor. See backstory [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/f0fyhs/phd_advisor_left_for_8_months_not_sabbatical_and/) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/fwu7x4/i_feel_really_bad_about_my_phd_thesis_esp_now/) Since posting that about a year ago, 3 of the MSc students quit the lab and the advisor has still not returned from abroad (of course citing COVID, but still).  He has no more active students that I am aware of.

In any case, I have published 3 of my chapters from my dissertation and I recently submitted the 4th. I have two more in prep. I say this not to brag, but to emphasize how unnecessarily critical my advisor was about my work and productivity. I received expert feedback on this 4th chapter from multiple external colleagues and mentors and was strongly encouraged by my new PI (a very reputable and established scientist with whom I am doing my postdoc) to submit the paper.  I submitted to a mid range journal, nothing flashy, but considered good.

I submitted this as the sole author because my advisor did not wish to be listed as an author.  This one chapter we disagreed on considerably, and I was left to do the entirety of the project with very minimal support from him. While I do think some of his critiques are valid, it is also somewhat outside of his scope, and I fully believe that I addressed his critiques in the text of the paper.

After a fairly long wait, I finally received the decision from the editor. There were 3 reviewers, and 2 of the three were kinda outrageous. They used words like ""horrible,"" ""disappointing,"" ""over ambitious,"" and mostly had ad hominem rather than scientific feedback. Almost nothing they said was constructive. They both voted to the reject the paper.  The third reviewer was the opposite -- very supportive, incredibly detailed and constructive comments, and edits which amounted to minor revisions.

The editor determined ""Major Revisions"" and said that the paper was absolutely suitable for publication in the journal and described reviewers 1 and 2 as ""unduly harsh"" and unconstructive.

The thing is, because of the small size of the field, I am able to guess who all of the reviewers are. Reviewer number 1 is an old riend/colleague of my advisor. He was actually on my my PhD committee until he quit a month before my defense, unapologetically, and told my advisor it was because I positively reviewed a paper that he rejected!!

Reviewer number 2 is also an old colleague/friend of my advisor. He was not as harsh but as #1 but was also ad hominem and dismissive.

Reviewer number 3 is a younger scientist and colleague of mine. He has no conflict of interest in this paper being published, and in fact has even said that he had a similar idea for a project! so if anything, there some level of competition between us. We are both on the job market in an extremely small field.

When reading the reviews of #1 in particular, he used the same exact language as my advisor and it leads me to believe that he consulted my advisor on this review.  I do not believe it was a coincidence because the parallels are just uncanny. This makes me believe that my advisor is actively sabotaging my work.

While I am extremely grateful that reviewer 3 was scientific in their review, and that the editors were able to see through the unscientific approach by reviewers 1 and 2, I am still left feeling incredibly anxious, disappointed, and concerned for my future in this small field.  My mental health really suffered under my advisor in the last year of my PhD and this is dredging up all of those feelings.

I suppose I am asking for advice from anyone who may have been through a similar situation?  I'm guessing there is nothing I can really do, but its just a troubling situation. I fear that this could be a constant problem for me whenever I attempt to publish without the \~ blessing \~ of the old guard.

k16zk3,ManicSheep,t2_80ct6kus,Tenure Track is slowly killing me. Need a mentor,"TL;DR: On a 2.5 year tenure track. Doing my best, which is not good enough. Stressed/Anxious all the time and feel insecure. Tenure review is in 3 months. Don't think I'll make it before then without getting a breakdown. Desperately needing a mentor :(


I am 35m, and in a niche sub discipline of psychology.

I moved from my home country as an Associate Professor (really cosy job) to a European Country. I took up an Assistant professor position and the changed to a tenure track. Been here 4.5 years now (on the tenure track for 1.5). Due to local labour legislation they could only offer me a 2.5 year track (where others have 5). Just note that my residency here is dependent upon my academic position.

The tenure criteria is really vague, and applied differently to different people. Where one got tenure with 3 publications, 1 PhD competed and 200k in grant money (with no academic citizenship), and another with 30 publications in 5 years, 2 PhDs and 50k in grants didn't.

Since jumping on this position I've been working my self to the bone. 18 to 20 hour work days (6 days a week) have become the norm. I've been quite successful with publications so far (12 papers published, 7 in review, 12 chapters, 3 edited books, 3 special issues etc) with an ok h-index (18), teaching Im putting in alot of effort and get high ratings (4.2/5), completed around 23 master theses and 13 bachelor ones. I'm also an associated editor for three journals and do a bunch of other external stuff. Grants less lucky... Only one big one of 155k and then a few smaller ones when I need them. My single PhD student is on track but his language capability is holding him back. Anyway I digress... Basically I'm doing alot (5 to 7 times more than others in my department on my level). 

The problem is the bar keeps moving and the subjective requirements keep changing. Nothing that I do seems to be good enough, and then I put in more hours and work longer to meet them. Like all.of a sudden we have a list of 5 journals we may publish in (all of which are unrelated to my sub-discipline), my teaching load increased significantly both due to corona and that my other colleagues didn't want to teach X course anymore (Also refused to..share any content of the course so I had to generate things from scratch)... So it was given to me. The funding I have to bring in has increased from 50k per year to 150k (o and where I am really good at getting companies to fund my project's.... This doesn't count!) etc. So nothing I do is good enough.

When I have interim performance discussions with my line manager there is no appreciation for what I do (Also for the department) and it's always about what I should do differently.

On top of this is the fear attached to being kicked out of the country because my visa is attached to the position. 

The stress and anxiety anxiety caused by all of this keeps me awake every night. The 4 hours I have to sleep each night... Is filled with restlessness and nightmares. This tenure track thing has made me feel so useless and insecure about myself. 

I have to submit my tenure documents in January and there isn't much I can do at this moment anymore. Usually there is also a mentor assigned to Tenure Trackers to help check documents and applications and things... And this also hadn't happened (I think corona got everyone distracted).

So I'm not sure what to do. But my mental health had taken a massive toll since starting on this journey. Don't think I'll make it till January without having a massive breakdown.

Seeing that I am not sure what this tenure review process involves, but I have to submit like Documents and reflections on things... I just wish I could test my things with someone. Not sure where or how to look for a mentor :(

I'm in my second-year of a humanities PhD at a top-ranked university in Canada. I've struggled with mental illness throughout my entire life (diagnosed bipolar disorder) and feel as if my health has just gotten worse during this program and especially during the pandemic. I've dealt with these issues before, including having had to take a few months off during my undergraduate studies after being hospitalized. I really thrived during the MA, but I think that was in part because less was expected of me than during the PhD and there was a clear end in sight (my MA program was only 12 months whereas average time to completion of my PhD program is over 7 years and often goes beyond the guaranteed funding period).

Over the past year and a half, I've noticed I've been ignoring my mental well-being in order to keep up with constant deadlines, research, writing, TAing and RAing duties, administrative responsibilities, etc. and that I am just burning out and am not sure if finishing this program is even worth it (especially considering I've been doubting recently if I want to be in academia). I think it might be in my best interest to take a leave of absence for a semester or two in order to get my shit together. I've already finished coursework and would take time off after I complete my qualifying field exams in the summer. I would be ABD at this point.

\--

I graduated from a UK university with an integrated Master's degree (MSci) in July this year. My mental health had been declining ever since my second year, but really nose-dived just before the first UK COVID lockdown, when I was working on my final research project. I had to rush to get what little results I could before the uni closed, as I would not be allowed to return before my deadline - I actually had to sneak into the lab the day after it closed to weigh the very, very few samples I had. However, the weighing balances were completely messed up - presumably from a very recent move between labs - and I couldn't get them to work properly. I panicked and measured what I could, but for one result I was getting a negative reading whatever I did, despite it having visible mass. In my stressed/anxious fog, **I wrote a random, potentially-plausible-but-maybe-not number down and not the actual number I was getting**.

Once I snapped out of it, I freaked out, because obviously this is falsification, i.e. academic misconduct and just bad unethical science. What then made it worse was that my anxious/depressive spiral got so bad, I basically did nothing for the next 3 months, then wrote my entire dissertation and recorded my seminar in the 4 days before the deadline, without sleeping and only fueled by caffeine... meaning I didn't remember that I falsified the result until a while after, and **it was a fairly large focus of my writing.**

Somehow I passed everything, so I was awarded my degree and got a good grade. I spent the last 6 months working on my health and now I'm thinking about finding a job and moving on. However, recently it hit me out of the blue - **my supervisor kept my samples** **and has my lab-book and disso for her records**, so if she ever decided she wanted to check what I'd done (if a bit unlikely, because she should remember it was a hot mess from start to finish and my results certainly don't mean anything), she would be able to tell it's fishy (on the massive assumption my non-falsified results match what she weighs them as) and do something about it.

If she finds out, what are the most probable consequences going to be?

\--

**TL;DR - in a moment of complete stupidity, I falsified one of my results, and it significantly affected how I wrote my MSci dissertation. My supervisor could potentially prove it if she was ever inclined to, and I am worried about the consequences, however unlikely.**

**Is this something that could potentially get my degree classification changed or even revoked? Or is it too small-scale to be worth worrying about?**

(I know it's just an undergrad paper and will never have even the slightest impact on the scientific community, but I feel really guilty about being a bad scientist. I also have no intention of pursuing a PhD at all (not just because of this though) and while I'm tentatively looking at industry grad schemes/science-adjacent jobs, I'm perfectly willing to take an office job and never look at another scientific paper again.)",1,2020-12-19 22:10:18,AskAcademia

kg4rpr,LillFeather,t2_3fzr0js,Conflict with Dept Chair - Again,"Apologies in advance, but this is a long one. As the title indicates, I have recently had a major conflict with my department chair. This is not the first time it has happened, and both times had to do with me asking questions about his course which I am teaching on.


Background on the course: this is an Introduction to European Literature course for 1st year students who then have to decide of they want to continue to study literature at all (so about half of any class is entirely uninterested in literature at all). Half the group is international and taught through English, the other half is taught through the local language. I teach that half.


My boss had revamped the course for this year and was very excited about the changes he'd made, but unlike the etiquette at this institution, he didn't inform or involve his teaching team at all at any point. This meant that everything was sprung on the teaching team last minute. This is where the first conflict came from: he released the mandatory texts a week before the seminars started, and for week 1 chose an article which I see as too difficult (and honestly ill-fitting, but I didn't say that), especially for my students who don't do the course through English. I contacted him about this and explained my concerns, making it clear that I understood we couldn't change the text anymore and instead asking for help in making it accessible for my students. The result was a stream of aggressive messages about how, as I am ""so young"" and still new to the job (1st academic job post-PhD, started last year) I obviously don't understand anything, ending with the setting of a disciplinary meeting the next day. He then spent the entire meeting smiling and telling me I'm so talented etc. and that he's just worried about me self sabotaging by worrying unnecessarily and ""giving the students ammunition"" before the course even began.


The second conflict was this week. He asked me to check the translations of the exam. I noticed that some of the questions were from last year's exam and no longer fitted the content of the course, at least the way I had been teaching it. I will admit a mea culpa here that I had been confused by the new course design and instead of asking for help, decided to just do my best to do right by my students, and follow the instructions I got at my disciplinary meeting as well as the syllabus contents. I should have asked my boss for help during the course, but I honestly am scared to talk to him and hoped addressing the topics in the syllabus was sufficient. When I reached out to him at the end of the course and, mistakenly (another mea culpa), in the group chat for the teaching team for the course asked about these questions and if the content was present in the lectures (which my boss gives), as I had not focused on it in my seminars at all, he proceeded to belittle me and (between the lines) vaguely threaten me. This was another incessant stream of messages full of screenshots proving just how wrong I was, again, in the group chat ""in front of"" my colleagues. I will not go into details about what was said out of fear of being identified, but it came across as extremely vitriolic. I got defensive and the conversation ended there.
Also, although I understand that I may not be in the right here and everyone in this department is doing their best just to get by, it has been extremely hurtful to have received no private messages from my colleagues who witnessed this - not to say I'm right, but at least to check if I'm okay.


After cooling down a little I decided the best course of action would be to send a long apology email to soothe the situation. I am not sorry at all, but I am very concerned about my career. Me getting this job was nothing short of a miracle, and the way the system works here any progression in my career is fully dependent on him - I cannot apply for a promotion with my Faculty, he has to nominate me, and my job is temporary but can be made permanent, dependent on him, again. His answer to my email was lengthy, and although he was no longer angry it outraged me again. The typical ""I was not angry but shocked and disappointed"", together with a strange mixture of talking about how amazing and talented I am, together with him expressing concern about my insecurities which lead to defensiveness, and my social ineptitude leading to a failure to fit in with the department, with a dash of kind understanding that as an inexperienced and young person I am of course in a different position and he has done his best to take care of me and has (in his words) spoilt me, leading to anger and envy from senior colleagues. I have seen no evidence of this, and feel he's trying to manipulate me into being insecure with my colleagues instead of confiding in them.


I think I took the pressure off the situation for now, but I am looking for another position as this is entirely unsustainable and damaging my mental health. I, perhaps mistakenly, consider myself to be sensitive in some areas but very tough professionally, yet he has me terrified and walking om eggshells anytime I have to get into contact either with him or those in the group who are close to him. I have talked to some colleagues about this, and they agree that he's outrageous, so it is nice to know that this is not some kind of hypersensitivity on my end - but it does not take away the creeping sensation that my boss is a bully and to involve HR or even just to tell him about how his behaviour towards me is inappropriate and damaging me would end my career here. A step I might have been willing to take, if there were any positions available elsewhere.


I love my job. I love teaching (not always and not as much as I have to, but still), I love research, and I dearly miss going for coffee with my colleagues or chatting with them at the office. Because of this I am deeply worried, and it is starting to affect me, especially being in lockdown. Since puberty I have not felt as deeply insecure as after his latest email to me. Am I being gaslit, or am I right even with the mistakes I have made? A tough question for people without the full context I am sure, so perhaps more of a rhetorical one, but one that plagues me nonetheless. I have not heard of any other colleagues being treated like this (the golden child who is also an idiotic piece of shit), but tbh I do not think anyone else ever questions him. I know I should dissociate and, as a colleague adviced me, ""fly under the radar"", but I don't know how to do that. I guess I am looking for a place to vent and get advice on how to get by in this volatile situation.


TL;DR I suspect I'm in an abusive relationship with my boss, who my career depends on entirely for now. What can I do to survive this situation, as I love academia and - aside from him - my job?",1,2020-12-19 09:23:05,AskAcademia

I live in Bangladesh and I have OCD and Depression. The problem is primarily OCD. I am currently working at a bank. I get out of bed at 7am, leave by 8:15am. I am at office from 9:15am till 8:30pm or more and I return home at 9:30pm more or less and sometimes even 10:30pm. I get 15-20 minutes for lunch and only one bathroom break during this time and its usually around 4pm or 5pm. This is 5 days a week so its about 67.5 hours a week or more that is spent on work (work+commuting). 

Now, the long work hours worsens my OCD SEVERELY. I get insomnia where I sleep only 4-5 hours. For those who don't know, OCD involves intrusive mental content (thoughts, urges, sensations, awareness etc) and compulsions (rituals, avoidance or any other behavior meant to cope with the intrusive mental content). Now when I work such long hours, my intrusive thoughts increase in extreme frequency. Think of an old radio with a huge amount of radio noise. My insomnia worsens, my depression worsens and life becomes totally miserable. Its absolute suffering. I also cannot do other tasks of daily living like chores, have a social life etc. 

Since a PhD requires usually 80+ hours of work a week. What do you suggest? Should I do a PhD given how I cannot tolerate long work hours?",0,2021-03-03 17:43:58,AskAcademia
dnncpq,marblemenow1,t2_14s0t7ve,Hoping to get into a PhD program for Information Science with a 2.72 GPA :(," I just want to say that I want to get a PhD in Information Science or a related field in some time. However, my undergraduate GPA at Cornell University is 2.72 due to these major life events.

During the spring semester of my freshman year, my backpack got stolen, which drastically affected my mental health and caused me to drop out of my introductory CS course. As for the fall semester of sophomore year, I was dealing with anxiety and undiagnosed ADHD and ended up with a D in linear algebra due to a combination of factors that I don't feel comfortable mentioning in Reddit.

I ended up taking a year off of university, which is why I have many W's on my transcript for the Spring 2018 semester but I came back to get a B+ in web programming and a B- in linear algebra as well as a C+ in discrete mathematics. Gosh, I wish my GPA was better when I came back from my year long leave of absence but it is what it is.

Currently, I'm taking Networks, Introduction to Learning Analytics (a graduate level course), Independent Reading and Research, Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures, and Engineering Probability and Statistics II. So far, I'm doing okay on these courses except for Networks and OOP and DS. I will try my best to bring up my grades for the last two years of my undergraduate career, especially that I did poorly in the first two years (except for freshman fall) in my subjects.

My ultimate goal with doing a PhD in Information Science or a related field is to do industry research in technology (I will be more detailed once I have the time to concentrate on my life goals and not grind on my problem sets.) Knowing that I love my research at the Future of Learning Lab, which I did for three months, as well as my research at the Social Dynamics Lab in which I am conducting research about mental health and self-help subreddits, I want to conduct my original research in these following areas (but are not limited to): a more inclusive book recommendation system that isn't Goodreads and features authors of different backgrounds rather than just the most popular reads, the perceptions of Western media vs. local media in the drug war in the Philippines using natural language processing and neural networks, and a website or a mobile app that helps people with executive function (e.g. ADHD, autism, executive function disorder) using machine learning and natural language processing.

Anyway, I'm confused how to get into graduate school. I was thinking of taking a year or two off to enter the workforce as a data scientist at a company and then go back into graduate school.

di89d7,SocialWorky2017,t2_4ra60hp,Not being invited to speak on my research expertise (social sciences),"Hello,

I don’t know if I will be able to explain this clearly, but I’ll try anyways.

In my hometown, I have been able to get media exposure in the last couple of years, mainly on the topic of mental health where I had to share my story for the most part.

I am now a doctoral student, but my research focuses mainly on sexual violence. I have started doing less and less public speaking due to the fact that I am very busy with my Ph.D, and that I have gotten tired of sharing my personal story. But also because I want my expertise on sexual violence to be recognized as it is my topic of research and the field I want to teach in eventually. I also have work experience in this field and did my master’s degree on this topic.

The thing is that I rarely get invited by the media to talk about my topic of research. It is  #firstworldproblem, I am well aware. To get myself ""out there"", I have written and published quite a few op-eds in the past months in major media outlets, but still, I have gotten very minimal requests (three interviews) to speak about those since September. I also joined two databases of experts that media can reach out to and have highlighted my research expertise in those.

I don’t know if this has to do with the fact that I am a racialized woman, but I see other (white) doctoral students get invited to speak about this topic in talks and in media daily. Clearly, I am not even considered while it is my expertise as well (and that I bring critical perspective to it), it seems like the journalists don't know that it is my expertise and think of me mostly when it's time to speak about my personal story/mental health recovery. The fall is a very busy season in terms of anything related to sexual violence, and I still don't get many requests to speak.

I don’t know if I am right to feel like this, the people who get invited are excellent. But I have this feeling like I’ll have to work x1000 more to get my expertise recognized, even though I have won a very prestigious doctoral scholarship for my research project and my skills.

clbx01,iamatonkatsu,t2_4aeg67bm,Advice needed on how to cope with labmate and grad school,"I'm currently in my master's program for a year now and I have 2 semesters left before I graduate. I want to know how I can get along better with my labmate and do better in my program. My labmate and I have had a bit of a tension especially in regards with my work --or rather the non-existence of it. My professor hasn't assigned me anything big except right now to stimulate cells and treat it with a certain compound. That's what I've been doing for the past two months and it's also a bit frustrating since the cells have only responded once to the stimulation and I am currently trying to solve this problem. 

What I'm frustrated about is with my labmate. She has confronted me recently (although this has happened multiple times) that I'm not doing anything in the lab. I explained to her that my passage confluency was too small so I had to wait until friday and saturday to do my experiment. She then proceeded to go on with, I can practice my western blot technique and asking if I can do it perfectly (also claiming that she can't do it perfectly too that's why she keeps doing it). The thing was, our post-doc said that I didn't have to do WB anymore and that I would just need to start practicing how to do PCR. This, I also explained to her. She then explained that WB is just as important as PCR. After that, she told me that I can also do some staining with our previous paraffin blocks. I told her that I tried to section the old paraffin blocks, but the cuts weren't very clean because they were already cut before and the blocks that I had left (1 per group), I decided to keep and reserve in case I would need to do it again if I do my final paper. She then proceeded to tell me that I shouldn't study in the lab (I have an upcoming international licensure exam next week and I only started bringing my materials to the lab 1-1.5 weeks prior, but then I do the online review on my computer). She tells me that I should do experiments in the lab and I should just study at home at night. She ends it by saying that I should work harder.

This is what frustrates me. My reasoning behind not doing any of those was first, I was waiting for my cells to grow. I also believe that even though continuously practicing technique is good even though it's just poking at the presence of beta-actin, I feel like it's a waste if I'm not actually looking for something. So since my cells aren't responding yet, I don't see the need to do the western blot for now. Partially, I think it's because it looks bad on our lab that I'm just in front of my computer while the other students from other labs sharing the same room as us are always doing something but I don't really mind because I know that I am working on something even though it's not 5 experiments or assays in a week kind of thing.

I honestly think our personalities just don't match. I'm very tempted to stop my degree and go home as I am taking my degree in another country. Maybe it's even the cultural difference because the work culture here is very different than back home. I can't even switch labs since I'm under a scholarship which prohibits me to do so. I actually like learning even though research is hard because I'm slowly getting the hang of it. I don't mind having experiments that take 12 hours or more as long as I actually learn or gain something from it. What I don't like is staying in the lab for 9 hours even though I don't have anything to do and I can't even study what I want to study.  I guess I'm the type that does what needs to be done and that's it. Nothing more, nothing less. Is it bad if I think that way?

Sorry for the long post, and I just really needed to get that off. My mental health in grad school is draining and I can't. What's bad about this is that it's not even the coursework that's draining me but the people around me. I just even realized I don't have friends in this city except for the ones I've went to language school with prior to starting my degree. I've been thinking of going to therapy so that I can do better in my thought processes but man, it's really expensive especially for someone who's only under a scholarship.

If you've reached this far, thank you so much for reading it. I appreciate any feedback you guys would have especially on dealing with my labmate and coping up with grad school. I hope you guys are pushing through the day, one paper at a time. &lt;3",0,2019-08-02 23:57:00,AskAcademia

71bfhx,suttiwit,,I can't write long papers?,"Alright. If it helps to determine the context: I'm 17 years old just a few months ago, I write quite a lot of documents (mostly about mathematics, computer science, and sometimes languages), and I hardly ever take a break from it (because I don't want to). I write those papers even though other people in my class are way smarter or do better than me.

I have been writing serious document seriously since I was about 16 years old. Now, one year has passed and I am still writing lots and lots of documents, but it has only been one year. In the period of one ""short"" year, my eyes have started to bail out. The effect of writing some papers that aren't even more than 2000 words long each for only one year seem to make my eyes go blurry. So, blurry in fact that I have difficulty writing after only a few minutes without getting headaches of some kind.

Perhaps the font size is too small, you ask? Well, let me tell you that one of my old friend used to say that they wrote essays and papers in 11pt. I got kind of jealous since I had always been using 12pt or 14pt (for personal papers). So, since then, I have always been using size 10pt (one size lower than my old friend) not because I want to, but because I want to overcome my mental turmoil of jealousy (LaTeX usually defaults to 10pt anyway). The person I got jealous of seems to write a paper from start to finish using nothing but 11pt; they don't seem to do the stuff I do or like writing much, but they seem to have a very bright future set ahead of them (and so I guess that writing small implies a bright future (QED! Fallacious? I know, but I'm kind of furious)). So, please don't suggest writing in one large font size and changing the font in the end, for I won't give up that easily. And it would really suck if my eyes give in right now because I really need to satisfy my depressive jealousy.

Okay, well, LaTeX does default to 10pt, which makes me happy because it is smaller than the person's writing, but the terminal I'm using to write the LaTeX source has this font set:

    URxvt*font: 9x15

Uhm... I don't know what font size that is, to be honest. I am quite afraid of it being 15pt. If my concerns are proven, I may have to change it to a smaller size for once.

Papers also take me a very long time to process. I have heard of people in college or university who write 5000-10000 words worth of text in one day or two and they do it well. I just don't seem to do it that well if I only had a day. Worst of all, it actually takes me half a day just to write 906 words of text non-stop! Why am I like this? Do I have ADHD or a learning disability or something? Why can't I be as good as others even if I actually consider myself a native speaker of English! My typing speed also converges at a limit of 96 wpm, never more, which may be another factor.

If my health and my brain cannot cope with papers just this size, then I do not know if I would even survive in uni.

I'm really afraid that I might not make it in college or university, that's all.

Here is an example of the paper that took me half a day. **It isn't really a paper,** but it should give you some ideas as to what kind of stuff I typically write, and you can extrapolate that yourself. Here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/sxpzpzktmxsb#/42013047/

97u8oh,medsciblues,,How do I stop taking on more I can handle? Is this a toxic mentality? Please help if possible,"Hi,

I am an undergraduate in my junior year of college in the U.S and I feel like I keep on taking on more than I can handle, and I have this urge to not stop. Spring 2018 was my first semester where I had a semester GPA of &lt;2.0. This summer, I had to take calculus based physics which was 5 weeks, calculus based statistics, which was also 5 weeks, and a 10 week calculus course all the while trying to work and do research; it didn't end well academically. I now have to send in an academic appeal form to get any form of financial aid back. I think I will likely get it back since this is the first time and my overall is still OKAY, but that isn't the point of this post.

I have friends who started since freshman year, getting involved since day one of college, doing this and that, and I feel like I am somehow...behind. My GPA has absolutely tanked within the past few semesters, and I acknowledge it is taking on too much, but at the same time, not being able to acclimate to the time restraints I have set up myself. So each semester, when I notice something ""wrong"", I acknowledge it, and then I try to fix it, by saying ""I know what I did wrong, so let me do it again"".

I wish I could try to stop trying to do so much in all aspects of my life, but I can't help but feel if I stop at any moment in trying to better myself or looking for new opportunities or experiences, I'm going to be left in the dust and be poor/homeless/unemployable for the rest of my life.

I have been doing research in a lab for 2 years now, and one thing my PI and grad student have said is that I need to have patience (Unsure what that means), and grad student has told me that I'm not superhuman and can't expect to do everything without cutting losses (which I understand). But I'll reiterate that when I acknowledge these things, I tell myself, ""Oh, I know what I did wrong, so let's fix it by doing it again but with the mentality that I know what I did wrong"".

After this poor spring and summer semesters, I am actively (again) trying to get involved with another project and looking for a job related to my field of study on campus as well as trying to learn a new skill that would be lucrative in the work force.

I feel like the way I am living is toxic for my mental health and I don't want to let up on or lessen my load because I feel like I'm giving away opportunities and not maximizing my time. I hate to say this, but whenever I have leisure time, I have feelings of guilt as if I am wasting my time. I don't think this is an envious issue, but rather a battle with myself. 

I feel like part of this realization stems from seeing how my parents lifes were after taking refuge in the States, but I don't know.

If anyone has fought this battle, please try to enlighten me on how to deal with it.",0,2018-08-16 17:20:57,AskAcademia

I graduated with 3.29/4 cGPA, 0.01 point away from minimum requirement of most grad schools in Canada but most of my bad grades actually came from my last two years of study, which definitely doesn't help. I also didn't have any research experience. I tried multiple times to get it during my second, third, and final year, only one professor got back to me and she just gave me pointers to improve my application. Funny enough, I actually put myself into one of the most difficult undergrad programs at my uni because they promised research opportunities for their students only to be rejected from that exact same opportunity because they told me that my cGPA was too low for their research work. I graduated with bad grades AND no research experience at all.

I have since been working odd jobs in admin and project management that have nothing to do with my interests. Just a job to pay the bills kind of thing and also a job to help secure my immigration. On the flip side, I became a permanent resident of Canada few months back and I definitely have better grasps of my own mental health/time management/maturity. Anyway, even prior to becoming PR, I have always wondered if it's still possible for someone like me to transition back to science. It's been 3 years now and I thought with getting a PR (more doors open), I should probably start looking into ways for me to get back into science. The thing is, with no research experience and mediocre grades, I feel like I'm stuck and unable to find my way in. I want to volunteer but labs will most likely prefer to take in undergrads/actual students. I'm even looking at professional healthcare degrees but my grades are obviously more heavily weighted there. I'm contemplating taking a non-degree year to improve my cGPA but I'm scared if it will just be a waste of money. Then, there's the age factor, I'm turning 27 this year.

Sad thing is because I've never done research, I really don't know if I like it or if I'm just romanticizing it. If you ask me right now, I'm probably an industry guy but without ever doing research, I really don't know. If it's any indication, I really enjoy the planning phase of projects at my company and quite well known for my attention to detail (admin wizard here).

My observation bias has this as the norm.

How often do you meet mentally healthy individuals in academia? If possible, treat students and professors as separate groups.

Edit: To be clear, ""poor mental health"" doesn't mean they need to go to a psychiatric ward. ""Poor mental health"" means they act against their best interests due to a mental hang-up. E.g. the student is extremely insecure so they work 80-100 hrs/week, eat poorly, don't exercise, and avoid other humans. ""Poor mental heatlh"" is not a permanent state of being just like ""poor physical health"" is not inherently permanent.

343ity,blueberrythoughts,t2_jqhtl,Do I have to minor in something?,"Hey AskAcademia, 

I hope this is the right place to post this. 

I am in my third year at a private university getting my BS in I-O Psychology. I transferred here from a community college about 6 months ago. Because of that, some of my classes didn't transfer over correctly, meaning I have plenty of transfer credit but no specific transferable sources to apply the credit to. It may be important to note that I am planning on attending grad school for I-O Psych as well. 

So here's my dilemma - I *could* be done with my degree in exactly a year. Graduating on time would be amazing, and much better for my mental and financial health. However, that completion date assumes I do not minor in something. If I do, it will most likely take two years. I do not have anything I would particularly want to minor in that would be useful for my resume - maybe Web Design? But I don't know if it is worth it, especially if I continue on and get a Master's. Will employers be turned off if I do not have a minor on my resume? Is it blasphemous for me to not have one? Any other thoughts as to how I should proceed?

Sorry for any errors I may have made, I have never posted on this subreddit before!",0,2015-04-28 00:42:01,AskAcademia

g96yr2,jellonaut,t2_f1kvt0c,"I opened up to my postdoc supervisor about depression, now I'm nervous that I shouldn't have done that.","I am a postdoc in a European country on full lockdown. I have been in a deep clinical depression for many months now. I have a history of depression and furthermore my father passed away last year (during the last months of my PhD). Anyway, these past months in lockdown have made things a lot worse for me. I have been working from home. My motivation is very low and I have been doing the bare minimum for my work, as I feel it is the best I can do right now. Today I spoke with my doctor and we decided to strengthen my depression treatment. I explained about my work, that I had very little motivation and that I was struggling to make progress in my work. He was very reassuring, saying that the world is sick right now, everyone is struggling and that it's not my fault that my motivation is so low. He reassured me I am not failing here.

I was feeling good for a moment but not long after at all, I coincidentally happened to have a call from my supervisor, chewing me out that my progress has been too slow these past few months. I immediately felt worse than before because it was the first time ever that he expressed his discontent with my work. Normally he is very kind and understanding. I apologized profusely and told him I would do better. But then, after the conversation ended and I broke down crying, I decided to email him to open up and tell him about the struggle I'm facing. (He's not completely in the dark-- I mentioned at one point in the last six months that I was depressed but I don't think he realized to what extent.)

Now I kind of regret sending him this email. I am worried he will think I am making exaggerated excuses for my slow progress these past months, and/or that he will think I am weak and/or taking advantage of the circumstances to be lazy, and that he will be less inclined to give me a recommendation even though otherwise I have done quite well in my work generally speaking despite my mental health struggles.

drt7ro,worrywort000,t2_35e91so2,"A professor told me I didn't belong in the program and insulted me a year ago, is there anything I can/should do about it?","I'm an undergrad majoring in theatre (and also a STEM field) at a public University. Last fall, I was taking a theatre class and I had a bit of a crisis, so I had to go my school's counselling services before the class, and it ran through the class, so I missed it. This wasn't the first time I had missed the class (again, mostly for at-the-time undiagnosed mental health issues), but I was within the accepted number of allowed absences. I got a note from counselling services and gave it to my instructor during class, and he said to meet him in his office hours to discuss an alternative assignment to make up for my missed participation points for the day, which is his policy for excused absences. When I went to his office hours, he told me multiple times that I obviously didn't belong in the major and he didn't know why I was there, that my work ethic, along with that of other students in the class, was deplorable, that in the real world I would never make it against even some of the other people in the class, and that I should seriously rethink my future if I think this is something I want to do.

Now, I'll admit that I'm not 100% confident in what I want to do in my future, and the specific realm of theatre that class was a part of (acting) is something that I decided I wasn't interested in pursuing professionally (partially because of this, partially because I found things that better satisfied me creatively). But also, that seems like a lot to me, especially given that I did do all my assigned work, and most of that is direct quotation. I didn't do anything at the time because I wasn't sure what I could do and I was worried about him retaliating in my grades, or at the very least, I didn't want to increase tensions even more by taking official action against him. I finished out the class with a B. I stopped taking acting classes after that and he went on sabbatical this year, so I haven't had to interact with him since then. 

I recently found an article in the student newspaper from last spring, the semester after I took his class, about professional oversteps by him and one or two of the other acting faculty, where they allegedly made an uncomfortable or discriminatory classroom environment, which reminded me of the conversation that we had, and made me ask myself: should I try to do something about it? Should I take the concern to a higher-up in the department? I think he's still on sabbatical, it's been a while, and I never have to take another class with him, so I'm not sure if it would even be worth it at this point, but also it feels like something that should be reported.",0,2019-11-05 03:08:02,AskAcademia
3o2b9p,backwardinduction1,t2_j66uj,Depressed about my Future.,"I'm feeling generally, anxious, stressed, and depressed after my first 6 weeks of grad school. While I won't tell you guys what exact shcool I go to in order to keep their reputation safe, I just feel like I need to vent and get some advice. I go to a top ranked school of public health for an MS in environmental health. My utlimate goal is to get a PhD, but for public health schools you almost always need a masters degree before you can even get into a PhD program.

I'm worried for two reasons:

1. I have the option to feed into the main doctoral program as a third year after the compleion of my master's degree, provided that I actually get in to that much more competitve program that has half as many spots as my current program (or possibly less based on departmental changes I've noticed). If I do this I continue on with my studies, do my dissertation and finish after a total of 5 years at the school. If I go to a different school for my PhD, it will probably take me 5 years there, so a total of 7 years of grad school.

2. I'm not fully sure I want to go into this specific area/field of public health or continue with public health after my masters. I'm extremely interested in GIS and urban planning, and while I'll have opportunities to take elective courses in these fields, I wonder if getting a PhD in those fields would be a better fit for me. Of course GIS oozes its way into every field, including mine in some circumstances, so I know it'd help me. Theres a lot of overlap between environmental health and urban planning, so I have hope that something will work out, but I'm not sure what will happen, and the uncertainty of it all, and the fact that I'll have to apply for things next fall is stressing me out.

I started doing lab-work for this one research project going on at my school. I wouldn't exactly call it research per se as its just lab work, and its related to air-exposure-assessment, so I have my doubts about whether deciding to it was a good idea or not. It pays well, which is a nice enough incentive, but would something like this be at all valuable for the future thats going to collide with me sooner or later whether I like it or not?

Just all the stress of keeping my grad school grades up, trying to be a competitve PhD applicant, trying to progress to do actual research by the time the spring roles around, trying to figure out what I want to do with my summer (we have to either do research or an internship then) and trying to figure out what I want to do with my life is just giving me a lot of mental anguish. 

What do I do?

3ny1cy,mooneys_purple_coat,t2_ph4jc,"Is there anyone here who is knowledgable about pursuing a PhD in the humanities (Film Studies), freelancing, or film/photographic preservation? I have a BA in Film Studies/English and an MA in Film Studies, and no real clue about what to do next.","I apologize for the interminable length of this thing (I'm now reminded of the pinned tweet currently on Matt Zoller Seitz's Twitter page -- ""**Q**: *Tell me an important life lesson you've learned.* **A:** *Nobody cares as much about what you're going through as you do*""). I would really appreciate it if anyone could take a look at what I've written, though. I welcome any advice, guidance, or anything of that sort. 

The title is a little inaccurate, BTW, as I clearly do have a few ""clues"" about what to do next, but I'm still feeling ridiculously uncertain. I'm terribly adrift. After committing so much of my time and energy to the pursuit of a BA, and then an MA, I wound up in a bit of a personal morass (for many complicated reasons). Following my MA, I decided to see if I could make it in the ""real world,"" and then spent a few years being almost completely disregarded by retail hiring managers (almost *no one* has hired me in the ensuing time since I completed my MA, and I've sent out consistent applications; consequently, I've been *unemployed for three years*). I've become way too accustomed to impersonal, boilerplate rejection letters. 

Not surprisingly, I have since reached new levels of sadness and desperation. Even the positions I thought I could acquire, with film festivals and the like, have revealed themselves to be woefully inaccessible. I've pored over my cover letters, made countless minute adjustments, sought out (and completed) volunteer work to goose up my resume, and I still feel like I'm still struggling to gain any purchase on anything resembling an adult life.

I admit that, in addition to my sense of accomplishment, a sense of assurance attended the completion of my MA, and I foolishly assumed that I would be able to get some work at a film festival with some reasonable measure of rapidity and ease. It didn't work out that way, as the imprimatur of academia doesn't guarantee success in all fields (even those which seem closely related to your studies). My paucity of non-academic experience is, understandably, a problem for some of the places I'm applying to (although, no one -- neither in retail or at a film festival -- has actually ever gone out of their way to explain their reasoning for rejecting my repeated applications, despite my attempts at requesting such guidance). 

In addition to these struggles, my mental health took a severe dip, my girlfriend of nearly seven years broke up with me, and my mother became a widow. I cannot leaven any of the pain I'm feeling with a sense of direction or purpose, which is what I am so desperately craving. This is partly why I think about a PhD often, as I miss the sense of direction and hope that I sustained while I pursued my undergraduate and graduate studies. 

So, now, as the spectre of the rest of my life looms before me, and my anxiety mounts, I'm beginning to wonder what will become of me. In the Atoms for Peace song, [""Before Your Very Eyes,""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWrUEsVrdSU) Thom Yorke expresses something of the terror of misspent and fleeting time:

&gt;
- Look out of the window /
- What is passing you by /
- If you really want this bad enough /
- You’re young and good looking /
- The keys to the kingdom /
- Sooner or later (x3) /
- And before your very eyes (x3) /
- Old soul on young shoulders /
- How you’ll look when you’re older /
- Time's fickle card game with you and I /
- You have to take your chances /
- The book of forgiveness /
- Sooner or later (x3) /
- And before your very eyes (x3) /

This sort of thing has been on my mind a lot. I'm coming across rather dramatic, I realize, but, given the desperation of my situation and how badly I would like relief, I believe my tone is warranted (in hindsight, some of this may sound like I'm hinting that I'm contemplating suicide, which is certainly not the case). Yorke's lyrics also suggest that there might still be time enough, but I really have to steel myself to adopt more charitable views, as I'm quite beset by depression and anxiety. 

As I mentioned, I've considered returning to school to pursue a PhD, but some of the impassioned arguments against that path (from those who have pursued it themselves) have been discouraging to say the least. Despite this, on some days, it seems like the clouds suddenly part, and it becomes clear to me that a PhD in Film Studies is in fact my proper calling. At such times, I remind myself that this inkling is borne out by my enthusiasm and work ethic during the pursuit of my BA and MA (and my nostalgic regard for that period). So, I'll be hit by such epiphanies while, for example, in the shower, following one of my usual bouts of frenzied thinking, and I'll suddenly feel the brief elation of clarity. Sure enough, however, by the time I'm stepping out of the shower, I'm already second-guessing everything. The clarity is ephemeral, and always succeeded by many different flavours of niggling doubt. 

Some of these doubts are tied into my youthful aspiration to create stories, and my more dreamy but impractical ideas about life's finite terms and the need to aim for what would really make you happiest (which isn't always the most  feasible object). I would still love to pursue a career where creativity is essential, whether that means writing fiction, like I used to dream about when I was a small lad, or trying to put together a film, or something of that nature. I don't want to fully turn my back on that part of myself (a part, I should add, that I never really got the chance to indulge after absorbing myself in my academic studies).

At the same time, I do love writing about film, and that is in and of itself a form of rewarding creativity. I do not want to give the impression that this would not suffice, or would be a compromise. I'm often torn, however, between the respective pleasures of film criticism and scholarship. I like both, but I feel like there's no clear way to really imbricate these two worlds into a profession. On the one hand, the prospect of a PhD is daunting and I question whether or not it's the right fit for me, but the idea of film criticism is accompanied by its own challenges (for starters, it's not exactly a conventional career path). 

So, while I would very much like to pursue criticism via freelance writing, I know that's a risky gambit and I'm quite uncertain about the viability of such an occupation. Plus, there are a lot of related issues that trouble me (let's put it this way, I recently entered the following two words into Google: ""freelancing"" ""pension"").

This sorry predicament has left me, in a desultory and anxious manner, to wander the Internet in hope of alighting upon some kind of answer or eureka moment. My latest discovery is a two year degree in film or photographic preservation. I wonder if this is my solution: it's a choice that dovetails with my passionate interest in cinema, and it may eventually provide me with a career and something like financial stability. But I don't know that for sure, and I'm really quite frightened of wasting even more time. 

If there's anyone out there who can speak to this or any of the other issues I brought up, please feel free to do so. ",0,2015-10-08 07:29:51,AskAcademia

I apologize because I'm sure this has been discussed many times already, but I'm hoping to get some insight into my particular situation. 

I am interested in graduate studies but my GPA is way too low at the moment for me to even consider applying. I struggled quite a bit in my first couple years with some personal issues (financial/mental health) and those issues really got in the way of my academic work. I also didn't deal with the academic fallout in a responsible way and I let things keep piling up. Overall, I failed 6 courses from simply not doing the work or showing up for classes, and I've got 6 voluntary withdrawals on my transcript. 

Since, I've gotten to a much better place and I've realized that I do want to pursue graduate studies at some point in the future. Outside of the failed classes and the VW's, my grades are fairly high. I will be staying another couple semesters to raise my GPA, but with such a rough transcript, I'm not sure if graduate school is really an option even if my overall average gets better. 

So I'm wondering if it will even be possible to get into a graduate program at this point? Should I focus instead on gaining work experience in my field and put off grad school for a while, or should I retake as many classes as I can to bump up my average as much as possible?

78mmtr,astro_tempest,,Who should I give emergency contact information to with regards to my mental health?,"I'm going to be starting my honours year in physics, and I have a psychiatric condition. 

It's very stable and I attend weekly sessions with a psychiatrist and psychologist. I haven't had a serious episode in about 5 years and they were rare even then. At my worst I can lose touch with reality somewhat, get mild hallucinations (""disturbances""), and generally zone out a bit. I can tell when things are beginning to deteriorate, and I'd usually have plenty of time to see a health professional or to take the medication that I have for those situations. Most times I'd be able to make small adjustments to my schedule to help me relax (even just walking outside) and nothing further is needed. Only at my absolute theoretical worst would I be unable to direct myself to medication, or unable to be trusted to do it correctly. At that point, I'd need help. I'm not violent in these conditions, rather catatonic. 

I have disability accommodations with the university but they only cover examination conditions and explicitly don't apply anywhere else. It's the university's policy that any other accommodations be organised between student and supervisor. Given that grad programs (and honours in particular) are very stressful, I think it'd be a good idea to give someone in the department the contact information for my psychiatrist, but I don't know who would be best. If confronted with a student who is exhibiting paranoia or lack of connection to reality, staff are supposed to consult the relevant mental health professional supplied if it's a condition that they're already aware of, and police otherwise. I'd like to avoid police. 

My supervisor is aware that I have mental health difficulties (but not specifics) and is very supportive, so I'd feel most comfortable giving the number to him. He'll also see me more often than any other staff member in the department. Giving the information to the secretary would make it more available to other people, but I don't know how she'd react to the information or the stigma I'd face if news got out. 

Any advice on how to go about this conversation with either? I want to make it very clear that it's a condition that I manage privately and that they're not expected to act as my counsellor or something, which I know is a concern some people have if someone admits to having (e.g.) depression. There are a lot of safety nets in place for me already and this is not a new condition. Giving them my psychiatrist's contact details isn't a sign that I think they're ever likely to need them either, it's just that *if* they ever need them, then by definition I'll be unable to supply.

My(now deleted) long post on StackExchange from March of last year. Detailing a lot of garbage from our Math department; it's hard to get across the context in which these comments were made, and a couple of these could be deemed somewhat inoffensive here, but mostly the environment was such that even the couple of seemingly mild incidents mentioned here seemed extremely serious, compared to another PhD environment I had been in till 2016. Frankly, looking back, I wrote this in a very measured tone. The biggest trigger initially for me to want to make these things public was the constant frothing at the mouth ultra demeaning way in which a specific PhD student behaved with me from the very beginning(as mentioned later), and later began the same with other international students(who also felt worked up with far less interaction with him than me). However, a lot of further incidents kept happening even after thisna initial impulse to make things public.

The incidents from 2019 and earlier this year would all have been dealt with a lot better if the present head of the department didn't become seriously sick, and he remained the head of the department from earlier on. Another recently graduated student wrote to me on Messenger that ""The department is going to become even more racist if he is not here now"".

&amp;#x200B;

This behavior is mostly from Spring 2018 and then Fall 2019. These raised extremely serious safety concerns at that time, and an office to address this behavior did not even exist inside this university until 2019. When I did finally report this to the new office, they said they take it seriously, but then completely dismissed everything mentioned here. Prior to that the only place to report this was their HR department, and I faced a further round of harassment from them, upon reporting the Spring 2018 events. I'm an Indian PhD student.

Let's call the concerned person X. The chair is called Chair.

In Spring 2018 I was teaching a Calculus class and X was then the so called supervisor in these teaching matters; at one point I was grading undergrad exams in his office. On his office door is a newsclip of the professor who was viewed as a terrorist for doing math on the plane. The newsclip ended in self-reflection, concluding that the only thing 'we' fear more than immigrants is Math.

While grading, at one point X casually remarked that he was looking for his boarding pass. I casually remarked we should all be careful doing Math on a plane; when he very proudly told me 'no, I'm white'. I replied; 'well wasn't the guy in that incident also white'? then he smugly said as a putdown, 'yes, but he was Italian, I'm not Italian, I'll be fine’. There was another visiting postdoc well within earshot in the room with his back turned to us, as this was happening.

A few days later, I had been late for a few hours in finishing grading; something that literally always people are, including X (I also wasn't very pleased when on the prior evening, my advisor from back then needlessly insulted me in front of several other faculty members for coming to a dinner with a colloquium speaker, when I had no intention to really go there but for the fact that I thought he would expect me to be there). While no one else had an issue, one of X's minions, a fellow PhD student, came to my office and told me it's disgusting I was late and that he was shaking in anger as a result. I told him politely to leave and shut the door of my office. Upon hearing this, X came to my office seeming extremely bellicose, physically intimidated me and forced himself into my office, as if I was a criminal. I told him also to please get out of my office , after which he got out and went to chair's office and started complaining about me. No one was inconvenienced then because I was late for a few hours with grading, and every single time I have graded with people, one or more people have been late with grading.

After a midterm exam, X was asking opinions about how to grade a contentious question; one of his minions passionately said something to which X replied in a conciliatory tone ""I know you're from U Chicago and you think you know best, but I disagree""; I was right there and also tried getting a word in, and X looked at me with absolute detestation, suggesting you don't have a right to say anything here.

Earlier that day, I was hearing him talking down to a Chinese graduate student, telling him there's an American PhD student also in the room he would be invigilating in for the exam, and that student would take care of everything, and the Chinese student doesn't need to know any of the procedures for setting up the exam in the exam room.

During the proctoring, we had to add up some numbers for some reason and I was doing it in my head; X's minion was standing there and suddenly he lost it; started saying 'it's disgusting you guys can add stuff up so fast'; talking about some racist tropes he has in his head about Indians. This was said in a really loud and unpleasant tone. X was right there and heard everything but said nothing.

Afterwards as we were grading in the lounge, as a lot of people were joking around I facetiously remarked that I might comment in an Indian student's exam in an Indian language; which of course I was not going to do. X got triggered and became serious and cooked up a story of some Chinese students and postdocs talking in Chinese in the corridors that apparently made so many people suspicious that there were serious complaints. This was said in a room full of graduate students, many of them Chinese, who interact in Chinese between themselves and with other Chinese faculty or postdocs and no one that I knew of found anything wrong in it. At another time, he told me in our lounge when others were present, that our university might be a nice place, but there is a Jewish clique, and then there is a Chinese clique and the whole environment is very divided. At another time, in our graduate lounge with a lot of people present, when I was casually remarking, after many such casual remarks by American students there, that the traffic here in Boston reminds me of India sometimes, X snapped and very threateningly told me: don’t B-S me, I’ve seen so and so movie, I know what traffic in India is like. Although the “very threatening” bit was so commonplace that it kind of feels strange to point that out.

As is the norm, X would ask for questions from graduate student instructors, in order to make the final list of exam questions. Not a single one of my questions were used in the two midterms, although a couple were used in the final exam if I recall. I found it unacceptable that none of these questions had been used in the midterms; I know of at least one other Indian phd student whose questions had not been used either, and he was OK with it; but I was not, with the amount of time spent in making the questions.

Surprisingly X once suddenly forced himself into my office last Fall, upon hearing some complaint from a recently graduated student about such issues, probably something about my general countenance struck a chord with him and compelled him to rush in to check if there was more pent up trouble further down the road, and I politely tried ending the conversation, because it was not productive. He concluded in solidarity, saying how he too was very wary when he first came here as a PhD student, since he was scared he would have to learn Hebrew, because of a large Jewish population here.

I've lost count of how many times one PhD student that Xhangs out with has said outrageous things in front of me, often directed at me; repeatedly saying how 'there are some typical Indians around here', that 'Indians are taking over' (even though there have only been 3 or 4 Indian students at a time in our program, and for the last 4 years there have been no Indian PhD students here) and how 'it's so funny there is great color consciousness in India since you guys are all brown'. Often these things were said in front of many other people, and if I counted individual instances, probably such comments were uttered a few dozen times in my presence. At one other time, in front of me and another Indian student who had mentioned that the Supreme Court judges in India are not known expressly as liberal and conservative partisans as is the case in the US, this student began to openly say in a disparaging tone that the judges in India would be no good anyway, in comparison to the US.

In the very beginning, in front of several other graduate students, he would be talking about a specific slur against Jews, that I didn’t know about earlier, in the tone that he was just curious about it but not using it himself, but kept using it repeatedly in front of several people. There was no Jewish person present when he kept on saying this.

At first I didn't think much of it, and even thought some of his comments about Indians was intended to be amusing which I shouldn't have; but upon talking with him a little more it was clear he was saying all these things not as a joke but meant everything. The worst situation was last Fall when during a mandatory meeting a couple of PhD students including me brought up some issues regarding transportation and mental health issues among undergrads, and after it ended, this PhD student in front of everyone else began to loudly say 'how funny it is how he always complains, it was so funny' and then came to my office and still kept insulting me to my face, ignoring the fact that there was another American PhD student who was raising far more issues than me .

There's also another PhD student X hangs out with all the time, who would froth at the mouth in my presence in the beginning, and in the presence of a few other international students; and probably it was the worst and most prolonged dehumanizing behavior I've faced from anyone younger than me, with him talking with me (and also a few other international PhD students a bit later) in a vile and threatening manner like we are lepers; however this person was careful not to utter slurs. I’ve spoken to a couple of other international students and they have also felt unnerved by him for prolonged periods, but I should emphasize this began the earliest with me and he was in the same year as me. Regarding him, I was speaking with another international PhD student, who told me that if someone behaved like that in his home country with him, he would punch him in the face. And this international student had to interact with him far far less than I had to. If it was in my own country, I would probably not punch him, but call the Police dozens of times.

This student became a favorite of one of our teaching coordinators, this teaching coordinator is someone we had no option to avoid and who would harass some of us on the simplest of pretexts. Another Indian PhD student remarked in front of me and someone else, that “the treatment of international students by this teaching coordinator is extremely poor”. I happened to mention this to another Indian PhD student here who was seriously harassed by this teaching coordinator and who had been documenting that harassment. Then the former Indian PhD student came to know about it, and sensing he might get into unnecessary trouble with this being added to the pantheon of comments and complaints, began to aggressively say “I never said such a thing”. Another international PhD student who graduated and got a postdoc job elsewhere called me after the completion of his first semester there; he had taught and graded along with PhD students in his new place and said it was refreshing and cathartic not to get harassed about simple matters in grading like he had been here. I have personally been talked to in a needlessly condescending way about minor (non)issues in grading, and in the beginning asked to regrade things for the flimsiest of (garbage) reasons. It is tiring to even talk about the nuisance created by this person in simple matters of grading; generally when I have graded with other faculty members here or at my previous university, things have been far more normal. Both her and X, after working with us for more than a year and apparently claiming to know us well, called me by another Indian PhD student’s name, which particularly in the US is considered very bad form.

There is yet another former PhD student here who I have seen behave in a very aggressive and condescending manner with other international students and I’ve talked with other international students about it. I myself always said hi and hello like is the custom in the US, and very rarely heard any hi or hello in return, and on one instance, as I was passing him by in the corridor, this PhD student looked at me in an extremely aggressive and ugly way, which would unnerve and make anyone feel unsafe, and if something like this happened on the streets you would move away as quickly as possible from there.

Coming to the incidents of Fall 2019, let's call the person Y, a PhD student whose desk was right next to mine in the office. Starting in September 2019, he would repeatedly put his boot on a chair pointing straight at me, just a couple of feet away from where I would be sitting and working, and when I asked him to stop this, he would do so and then resume a few days later, and then say I purposefully moved in the view of his feet so I could claim that his feet were pointing towards me. (I had earlier tried to make eye contact suggesting that this is really very poor, with me having to see the underside of his boots from a couple of feet away, but he didn’t respond to my very polite non-verbal cues.) Then a few days later, he would say in a very overbearing tone that we should now look at the configuration of the chairs so he could explain to me how his feet were not pointing towards me; this is after the chairs had all been moved around within the intervening days. Hearing all of this, I had told him 'I have work to do and don't want to engage your third rate ilk'; which is not a nice thing to say, but under the circumstances seemed quite necessary. Afterwards Y saw me in the corridor and came eyeball to eyeball, with an extremely threatening body language, standing inches from me, saying in a theatrical way, ""don't you ever disrespect me ever again"", because apparently that was his sole privilege.

After this he began keeping his bag on a chair very close to my desk and far from his desk, in some kind of passive aggressive show of force. I took a picture of this and showed our Director of graduate studies, let's call him Z, and he knew of the previous incident, and he asked me not to get worked up over it, and that he 'noted' it. I said it's better to change offices for me; and this is done informally by grad students all the time. However, Z personally intervened and said that's not necessary, and we should get along. This might have been due to a personal dislike of Z towards me. I was always polite with him but didn't think the world of him to take his Combinatorics 1 class, but took a Combinatorics 2 class taught by a prodigious postdoc in the department.( It turns out I got two papers on my own from that Combinatorics 2 class, one of which now got a favorable review from a top Combinatorics journal.)

Z was miffed, and told another faculty member (as narrated by this other faculty member to me) how I can at all do research in Combinatorics (doing Combinatorics research was never my plan anyway) if I didn't take his Combinatorics 1 class and in turn this faculty member relayed this to me. At that time, I met with Z and he told me that one of the aforementioned PhD students who said things like “you f—ing Indians” to me and behaved in offensive ways dozens of other times, was just “special”, and I should just learn to live with it. Then Z, being from a Western European country, told me in solidarity, after having seen the list of alleged incidents, that “Americans don’t dress well”, and there are other similar kinds of general problems we always deal with.

I’m not sure exactly and would hope they both did the right thing by asking this other graduate student to leave when they were talking about me, but Z and this faculty member were both saying condescending things about me, as this other faculty member himself told me coming out of the office they were speaking in. I was then asked to go to this office a minute later to speak with Z, and saw this other PhD student sitting in that office and it seemed like he was grading exams for a while. I would hope the PhD student was asked to leave for the time when these two faculty members were disparaging me.

On November 14 2019, as I was just entering the office in a bit of a hurry, and Y was coming out coincidentally at the very same moment, I did my best to move sideways, and there was a huge amount of room for him to move out, he deliberately rammed his shoulder into me, and kept ramming it into my body for a good few seconds. This now got into the territory of physical assault; and I immediately screamed about this, and a seminar was going on, and people got startled and closed the door.

There were no direct eyewitnesses to this. Later Z(grad advising head) told me that Y talked with him and that Y was minding his own business and that I started screaming at him unreasonably. Then Z said that if I complained about this to the Campus police, then I would probably get expelled. To the credit of the chair of the department, he intervened and said no one can get expelled like this.

Z, the graduate advising head, also looked at documentation which listed comments by X about Italians, Jews, Chinese, Indians, and documentation of all the bellicose attitude from him, and then declared that none of this is offensive(he wrote this in an email that is with me). Then he told me I should have just let it go when another PhD student started saying stuff beginning with “you fucking Indians” or something very similar, and when this was said in front of the teaching faculty member X, instead of getting further appalled, I should have reasoned with X.

It is sometimes next to impossible to function properly in this kind of environment; and especially when things can get into the territory of physical assault so quickly and a faculty member with an axe to grind in this manner could step in. Compared to the previous graduate program I had been in, this was just a casually toxic environment; things like a graduate student who ordered a book through Amazon from India because it was cheaper and then in front of everyone began mocking what apparently was (to him) the poor presentation of the book as it arrived, or when in a nearby university during an AMS meeting an Indian mathematician with a bit heavy accent was giving a talk, a graduate student from our department began to openly laugh at the accent, looking at me like why I didn’t also laugh at that accent; when all the few dozen other people in the room were being serious with the talk (and some attendees seemed to have been old friends and acquaintances of this Indian mathematician).

There’s another faculty member here who says loudly to another PhD student, both taking it in a joking manner apparently, “don’t steal my f%$#ing car, you Albanians steal cars”, and the PhD student finds it funny and goes around telling people how funny this is. I was in the office of this faculty member when he said this; interrupting what I was trying to discuss with him. At another time, this faculty member said to his Complex Analysis class, “we have to kill the poles in the denominator”, then paused, and then quipping “let’s not talk about WW2 now”. Here, poles is a mathematical term, and Poles also is apparently a reference to Polish people.

The question is, how do I tie these incidents together with the incidents from the other post, and mention how it can sometimes be very difficult to function in such an environment, and that they should immediately stop threats of expulsion? To the immense credit of the department, I now have a new office which is peaceful. However, right in the next office is a guy who has unnerved many of the legal aliens in the department with his weird and threatening body language and behavior.

Edit: I see that some people are saying how putting your feet up is not a big deal in the US. I've seen this among officemates before, some good friends of mine, and it was perfectly fine. In all those cases, they were not pointing their feet squarely at me with such an obviously poor body language, and they were polite enough that if I would tell them I found it disrespectful, they would be mindful of that. In this instance, I told this person to stop, yet he started doing the same thing after a few days, having the audacity to say I purposefully moved in view of his feet to claim this; as if I have nothing else to do. Hence my response was a necessity.

Update: Y has currently graduated and has been taken in as an instructor within our department and is apparently going to be teaching graduate courses. The other graduate student who used racial slurs against me was called special by Z and Z told me he deserves our understanding. At the same time, I’ve been constantly harassed and hounded by the university administration and threatened by their lawyers. This of course is explained by the fact that after the Office of Diversity and HR told me everything is fine, I asked them in return how they would like it if I made these things public knowledge.

Part3:

I'm an Indian Mathematics PhD student somewhere in the US, and have been working with a faculty member affiliated to a university near mine, from the beginning of 2019. At the end of November 2019, I completed the proof of a problem given to me, under the so called guidance of this faculty member, although he had very little to do with it for a long time, except one contribution in the end, which was commendable. Once he came up with this alternate way to prove what I had already proved, he immediately began to call my work rubbish, and said, you will only write my argument in your thesis. Towards the end, I implored him to write the part that he thinks he is correct in, since it was going to be a joint paper, but he said that no, I must rewrite things and incorporate his idea and do the rewriting even when it was going to be a joint paper.

An update to this is that the paper was quite late in being written by me; months after it should have already been written. I asked my advisor then to become a co-author but then surprisingly he refused; this is two months after I had stopped speaking with him. Recently the paper was peer reviewed by a very reputed journal and the referee said the arguments are all deemed correct.

He began to continuously berate and belittle everything I have done, and grew extremely hysterical when I suggested a similar but different result was also within reach, which he didn't think possible. We were once sitting in a casual eatery, and I was calmly trying to explain some arguments, and he seemed extremely agitated, talking over me, calling the arguments wrong, but then trying to explain the same thing to me, as if it was his argument.

I would have written up the project and sent for publication, but the extremely hostile attitude of this person stopped me from doing that. After mid-December, he again contacted me in the middle of January, and he expected me to regurgitate all the proofs to him again and again till the middle of March and do nothing else in that time with him. He would condescendingly tell me what according to him is right and what is wrong, in this time interval.

It's unbelievable that he would prevent me from writing down the next result which he believed was not possible, but which would take an hour to decide on, with a receptive person. I found this an unacceptable waste of my time, and also if I had to look for jobs and graduate in 2021, this was an unacceptable delay in sending the paper to a journal, although realistically the plan was to graduate in 2022.

I'm appalled by this kind of hostile attitude on a project where the techniques are so elementary, essentially nothing more than the pigeonhole principle is used, although things become a bit complicated. I would often tell him I have certain things figured out, and don't have to write it out since it is simple enough; and he would say OK; then next week he would completely berate me saying you know nothing about this. Perhaps not accustomed to working with someone who he feels superior to, that too from India, who did things much quicker than he anticipated.

I had been speaking with a noted emeritus faculty member here, who is a renowned Combinatorialist, and telling him what was going on, and he sounded genuinely sorry for me in this situation but told me he was powerless to do anything about it. He was the only person who sounded genuinely sympathetic in this situation, when I wrote to him saying, to paraphrase, “having been in another US university, I didn’t expect this kind of ethnocentrism to be propped up like this”. I also sent a futile email to Z about what was happening, who only replied writing that my then advisor would have solved the problem even if it was not for me. In a later correspondence, Z said that there was enough reasons to expel me on academic grounds.

Upon reporting this behavior in December 2019 to the department, I immediately began to get threats of expulsion. This is at the time when I had two publishable projects near completion. For my own good, I had to think to try to work with someone else, and I tried to talk with a faculty member about a particular problem in his area of expertise that I did substantial reading on and that I found interesting and wanted to work on. He completely ignored me. Despite this, during those times, at least 4 to 5 times I heard over a span of three months that my funding should get withdrawn and that the department would not be able to keep me.

The faculty member who I was once again interested in working with, had himself started advising an Indian student who was in his 4th year, in Spring 2018, although this student didn't have any completed projects till then. Our department is such that at least five people have changed advisors in their 4th year (at any single point we have &lt;30 PhD students) in the recent past, but none of them were threatened like me; and I doubt any of them could probably also objectively defend a thesis in their 4th year, before switching advisors, if they had to. Now I'm working with another mathematician in a nearby university, and in the process I have had to change to another area of research this late, which is not a great thing.

2cxqtr,[deleted],,Searching for college scholarships/grants aimed at students with mental/emotional disorders (Ex-post from /r/depression),"TLDR - College student in search of scholarships for people with Refractory Depression, ADHD combined-type, and/or General Anxiety Disorder. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm a 21 year old from the Midwest (USA), and I'm currently in the process of re-enrolling at a very prestigious university. I originally went to college upon graduating high school, and I was lucky enough to be chosen to take part in a leadership/philanthropy scholar program, which only accepted 22 applicants out of a pool of 4000; it's a program through my university. Additionally, I have strong relationships with several top professors and administrators (i.e. people who can move mountains). I'm telling you all of this to explain why it's so important for me to re-enroll at this school in particular, rather than going to a cheaper (and far less prestigious) alternative.

My problem: I've withdrawn twice on a ""Medical Leave of Absence"" due to my mental health issues, and, consequently, I've lost eligibility for several scholarships due to taking time off. I have a 3.7+ GPA, so no problems there.

My parents are willing to help pay, but no more than 1/5 of the total cost. I have one scholarship to cover 2/5 of the total cost. This leaves me with 2/5 to cover, or about $15,000ish. Because of my mental health problems, I haven't been able to maintain steady employment to save up money. The real drag is that I don't qualify for much financial aid due to my parents' high income (approximately $300,000/year), and they don't feel obligated to contribute more than $6-7,000 per semester. They also refuse to cosign on any loans, so that's not an option. The only loans I can get without a cosigner are federal loans, which aren't near enough to cover the gap.

I'm looking for scholarships/grants for those affected by mental/emotional disorders, or ANY others I may qualify for. I have Refractory Depression (Treatment Resistant Depression; Chronic Depression), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, severe ADHD combined-type, a couple random learning disabilities, possible Bipolar Disorder, probable OCD, and if I think of any others I'll add them later.

My academic focuses:

1) History major - with a focus on pre-Civil War US and African American history (history of American slavery), as well as Gender/Sexuality history, and public policy spanning all the aforementioned.

2) Math/Statistics - focusing on building/applying statistical models to sociological-esque research

3) Writing (minor) - I've been hired professionally as a writer and editor, as well as tutoring writing

My eventual goal is to either pursue a history phd and go into academia, or working at a thinktank dealing with public policy.

Sorry for the multiple digressions, and thank you for taking the time to read this. Please let me know if you have any advice on what I can do!!

Hi,
I am in school currently to get my bachelors in Psychology but won't have that degree for another three years. I know I need my masters and possibly even a doctorate to become a psychologist. I just moved to Florida and so far no one has been able to answer my questions. Maybe you guys could help me? My first is: while I'm in school is there any type of work I can do within the field? I saw somewhere online that I can possibly be an ""after school counselor"" but have found no openings and don't know where to look. I am starting my internship this summer but have no clue where that will be yet. Second, if I get my bachelors, is there anything that I can do in the field of psychology or human services with just that degree? It is my passion to help others and I have volunteered a lot, but would like to get employed if possible. I have a learning disability so it will take me a while to get my masters.

1qerhm,orangefinger44,t2_dvfdl,Where to study physics and/or philosophy in Europe?,"I'm currently attending an undergrad program in the US for philosophy, but after a year and a half I have decided I need to transfer. Last year I made a medical request for a single room because having a roommate was throwing me into a very severe depression, causing spikes in my anxiety, and making my OCD much worse. Unfortunately, my request was denied, and this semester everything has gone to hell in terms of my mental health - doctors keep putting me on more and more medications in order to deal with my depression, anxiety, and OCD, and I don't want to keep taking meds if all I need is a room to myself. I've considered reapplying for a single room, but it seems hopeless - my psychiatrist wrote a very strong letter saying that a room to myself is very important to my mental health, filled out tons of forms detailing all the medication I've been prescribed after getting a roommate, and the housing department still decided that it's not necessary, so I don't think anything will change. 

In order to resolve this problem, I was planning on transferring to a school in Europe, where not only would I be able to finally study in another language, which I think would be a fun challenge, but I could get my own apartment and hopefully find myself in a better mental state. I have recently gotten very interested in physics (thinking about switching my major), and so far I have been looking into the University of Munich and Heidelberg as my top choices because of their physics programs, but I haven't found any programs in physics and philosophy in continental Europe. I thought I would come here to see if anyone has any suggestions.

I would consider US schools, but I think that after this semester I probably wouldn't get in anywhere as my grades have dropped from making the Dean's list first semester, to only taking 3 classes second semester, to barely staying above C level this semester. If there's anywhere that might still accept me in the US or Canada, I'd be interested to know. 

Sorry for such a long and personal post, but I'm really not sure what my options are right now with such a bad GPA for this semester.

Unfortunately, I am dealing with severe mental health issues. I suffer from paralyzing, debilitating anxiety and extreme feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy. Basically I am no longer a functional adult. I have sort of scrambled together a proposal for a thesis topic but I've now realized that not only I am not really interested, but I also cannot possibly manage to work on it - the topic is complex and would probably be positively challenging for a healthy student with a sound mind, but for me it only looks like an insurmountable hurdle. I am having panicked breakdowns on a daily basis and I cry a lot. I literally cannot even think about it without starting shaking. This covid crisis doesn't help either. I know I'm gonna mess up at one point or another and I know I'm never gonna be able to complete the project.

I am already seeing a therapist, but he can only do so much.

I should defend my proposal in a few days, but I haven't even prepared a presentation. My supervisor has no idea about any of this, he only believes I'm your average lazy brat (which I am - but that's besides the point). I'd like to speak with him about it, but first I am really ashamed, and second asking for a deferral is not possible in my case - I would have to quit altogether, because by deferring I would lose my scholarship and these studies wouldn't be financially sustainable anymore. But quitting in the middle of such an economical shitstorm, with my mental state, is not ideal either isn't it.

At the same time, I gotta be honest with my supervisor and all the other professors because they deserve to know and keeping on kicking the can down the road is never gonna work.

So what's the best way to address this?",0,2020-04-21 21:50:59,AskAcademia

I am extremely fluent in neuroscience, biology, psychology. My math is meh, but functional. I am computer science capable, never really been challenged to do anything too advanced and I find it semi-dull to do without a project. I also probably have the clinical experience of a master's student in counseling because I quite literally lived in therapy for a year, been to mental hospitals, prior to 5 years of intensive therapy, groups, AA, have had mostly mentally ill friends and upwards of 12 therapists/psychiatrists in various contexts. I love the historiography of psychiatry... etc. I am a big mental health and society nerd. I can also 3d model and I have animated someone's cancer bio Ph.D. thesis before for fun which was estimated at 15,000 shellings LOL...(if anyone needs some graphical abstracts I work for advice/conversation cause I simply enjoy making them and learning about projects!!!) my point is I can barely get myself out of bed, eating at a surplus of food is an achievement, and the only thing that gets me out of bed is the sheer joy of learning. I am completely failing to do this in a structured environment, I have had really really bad dysgraphia which makes it very time consuming to do ""non-objective based"" work. I learn by doing very much. I have had an internship at M.D. Anderson and I did so much better than expected considering I was a low functioning high school student at the time. I gave a great presentation, somehow I have quite the stage presence in spite of my terrible social anxiety.  I am horrible at showing up to class and doing the in-class pop quizzes which are standard at UH, I have missed every test, I can't get myself to go to class... I mean I know I can force myself to go and I do, it's just I cannot keep it up. I get so bored and anxious in lectures, and I know I can learn all the material on my own if I saw the point or if it was delivered in a more meaningful fashion.   
Right now I am considering getting a job where I have to be there (a commitment device for existence lmao...) like construction, or service (which I have worked before and did a little bit better) and can be less of a leach on my dad financially. I am mildly well connected I guess, hence my very nepotistically achieved the internship (I stuck out like a sore thumb compared to the high functioning, accomplished, and totally awesome international students!) But what are connections when I can't even get a simple degree, because its ""too easy and dull"" but I would no doubt still struggle regardless. My situation reminds me of a twisted and far more realistic Goodwill Hunting. Averagejoe Hunting perhaps? As I know if I could apply myself its not as though I would immediately be hired by the department of the defense merely for the biggest boy brain. I read neuroscience, psych, psychiatry, physics, etc. out of sheer interest and its the only time I do not feel so hopeless. I have recently been getting into mycological analogies to brain function and its pertinence to how the brain navigates social networks, and developed evolutionarily (downloaded a cool logical simulation software and I am going to try to recreate neuronal ""sexual communication"" given synaptic pruning, sensitization, habituation, potentiation, and glial nutrition to see if following the same principles of slime mold apply to neurons, I have found a lot of similar mechanisms with obscured by seemingly different biological manifestations of similar principles!)   
I have been called Rick Sanchez recently, which while sure its a nice compliment considering who you could get as a depressive, its sad... I want colleagues! I want my life to have contributed to a body of literature that can solve genuine human problems! I just am floundering so tremendously on paper, and I feel like I am accelerating in my education off the books if you will. It's frustrating... people talk to me and think I must be a superstar student but I'm just wasted potential at best.   
What are the possibilities of someone coming into academics from this angle? Could I ever become involved in an institution without a degree through sheer merit alone? Could journals accept (assume to be exquisite for sake of argument) theory, as I don't exactly have a lab..., from unaffiliated randoms? Does anyone have any advice for me? I have thought about starting a youtube channel, (like ""What I've learned"" but I don't know if that would really help me get into academia. I want to help people with depression, borderline personality, and frankly anything that causes misery. I want to mature badly but my depression is fundamentally resistant as it is likely the comingling of a personality disorder, trauma, and genuine common cold depression/anxiety since I was in seventh grade, I am 18 rn.

The voice in the back of my mind that wants this to be alright is saying, ""someone else simply did the hard work of going out and finding them, putting them into a review article, etc.""

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the two examples.  First is a portion of the original work by Exline (2013): 

&amp;#x200B;

***WHEN AND FOR WHOM DOES STRUGGLE ARISE?*** 

*Although struggle can be framed as a natural part of spiritual or religious development (Pargament, 2007), it can be useful to reflect on when—and for whom—struggles tend to arise. As described in the following section, many studies have assessed strug- gle in response to negative life events such as illness, and this seems appropriate, particularly given that negative life events often elicit negative religious coping (e.g., Bjorck &amp; Thurman, 2007). Yet, as we will see, there are many types of religious and spiri- tual struggle, and some might occur even in the absence of serious negative events.* 

*A large-scale study of college students (Bryant &amp; Astin, 2008) identified several religious and spiritual correlates of struggle. For example, greater struggle was associated with being part of a religious minority group, a quest orientation toward religion (see also Sandage, Jankowski, &amp; Link, 2010), and seeing God as elusive (i.e., mysterious, “universal spirit”) as opposed to beloved or protective. Religious and spiri- tual predictors also may vary on the basis of the type of struggle. Concerns related to desecration, for exam- ple, are more likely among religious persons who per- ceive violations to their sacred beliefs (e.g., Pargament, Magyar, Benore, &amp; Mahoney, 2005). Anger and disappointment toward God, in contrast, are more likely among those lower in religious commitment (e.g., Exline et al., 2011) and intrinsic religiosity (e.g., T. W. Hall &amp; Edwards, 2002) but higher in extrinsic religiosity (e.g., T. W. Hall &amp; Edwards, 2002). Anger toward God is also more likely when people see God’s intentions as cruel (Exline et al., 2011) and when they see such anger as morally acceptable (Exline, Kaplan, &amp; Grubbs, 2012).* 

*Several studies have identified individual- difference predictors of religious or spiritual strug- gle. Struggle has been associated with demographic factors such as being young (Exline et al., 2011; McConnell et al., 2006), female (Bryant &amp; Astin, 2008), and unmarried (McConnell et al., 2006). In terms of personality, struggle has been linked with insecure and anxious or ambivalent attachment (Ano &amp; Pargament, 2003; Belavich &amp; Pargament, 2002; T. W. Hall &amp; Edwards, 2002) and negative affectivity (e.g. Ano &amp; Pargament, 2003; Schotten- bauer, Rodriguez, Glass, &amp; Arnkoff, 2006; Wood et al., 2010). Anger and disappointment with God have also been linked to narcissistic qualities (Sandage &amp; Moe, 2011), such as tendencies to exploit others (T. W. Hall &amp; Edwards, 2002) and a sense of entitlement (e.g., Wood et al., 2010). Reli- gious or spiritual struggles are also more likely for those who report poor social support (McConnell et al., 2006) and family-of-origin stressors such as alcoholism (Szewczyk &amp; Weinmuller, 2006) and childhood physical or sexual abuse (Fallot &amp; Heckman, 2005).* 

&amp;#x200B;

And then here is my own work borrowing from their organizational structure and most of the citations they also used: 

&amp;#x200B;

***Religious and spiritual struggles have been associated with negative physical health outcomes and increased emotional distress*** *(Exline, 2013; Exline, Pargament, Grubbs, &amp; Yali, 2014; Exline &amp; Rose, 2005, 2013)**. Exline (2013) provides a thorough review of the literature on religious and spiritual struggles, organizing the findings between findings related to mental health outcomes and physical health outcomes, as well as identifying different groups of people who tend to experience religious and spiritual struggles. Borrowing from Exline’s (2013) approach, I will summarize who tends to experience religious and spiritual struggle as well as the links and correlates between religious and spiritual struggles and associated mental and physical health outcomes.* 

***For whom does religious and spiritual struggle tend to occur?*** *Religious and spiritual struggles occur for different groups of people and also differ based on how individuals view God and/or a divine figure. Bryan and Astin (2008) found in a sample of college students that correlates of religious and spiritual struggle included how involved a student was with a particular religion, their view of God (i.e. viewing God as a “Divine Mystery”, “Beloved”, or “Teacher”), their ability to have a compassionate self-concept, and whether they viewed their faith as a spiritual quest. Regarding viewing faith as a quest, other research has found a spiritual quest orientation to religion to have negative spiritual and emotional effects as well* *(Sandage, Jankowski, &amp; Link, 2010)**. Individuals who experience higher levels of anger or disappointment towards God are typically lower in their religiosity* *(Exline, Park, Smyth, &amp; Carey, 2011)* *and also endorse a more extrinsic religiosity* *(Hall &amp; Edwards, 2002)**. Individuals are also more likely to view God as angry when they believe God has cruel intentions* *(Exline, Park, Smyth, &amp; Carey, 2011)* *in addition to believing negative protests against God are acceptable* *(Exline, Kaplan, &amp; Grubbs, 2012)**.* 

***Differences in who experiences religious and spiritual struggles have also been observed based on varying individual factors.***  *Bryan and Astin* *(2008)* *found in a cohort of college students that correlates of religious and spiritual struggle predominated for those of a minority religious preference (i.e. Buddhim, Hinduism, Islam, etc.), were female, attended a religious institution, studied psychology as a major, and had experiences that challenged or introduced new worldviews. Another demographic factors that has been associated with religious and spiritual struggles is being young* *(Exline, Park, Smyth, &amp; Carey, 2011)**. Religious and spiritual struggles have been observed in individuals who exhibit insecure ambivalent, insecure, or anxious attachment to God styles* *(Ano &amp; Pargament, 2013; Belavich &amp; Pargament, 2002; Hall &amp; Edwards, 2002)**, and negative affectivity* *(Schottenbauer, Rodriguez, Glass, &amp; Arnkoff, 2006; Wood et al., 2010)**. Additionally, anger and disappointment towards God have been associated with narcissistic qualities* *(Sandage &amp; Moe, 2012)**, exploitativeness* *(Hall &amp; Edwards, 2002)**, and entitlement* *(Wood et al., 2010)**. Individuals who report lower levels of income and social support* *(McConnell, Pargament, Ellison, &amp; Flannelly, 2006)**, endorsed growing up in an alcoholic family* *(Szewczyk &amp; Weinmuller, 2006)**, and childhood abuse and sexual violence* *(Fallot &amp; Heckman, 2005)* *also show higher levels of experiencing religious and spiritual struggles.* 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not interested in feedback on aspects of the writing, etc. I strictly am interested in if this is academic plagiarism or not, so that I can change my approach and go about writing my literature review differently if so. Thanks.

4do416,8476929299,t2_wxhjn,"""Protocol"" if a professor knows you're suicidal?","Hello,

My apologies for the dramatic title. In a bit of a crisis. I am supposed to graduate in May (so a month and a half or so) but am pretty borderline in terms of satisfactory grades to succeed.

Not going to bother you too much with my history, but I was valedictorian of my high school class, great teacher recs, did tons of sports/community service/etc. (grew up in an environment where college admissions seemed like the life goal.....guess I never really thought about what it would be like once I got there though). Not to sound like I am bragging or something, because now I am the complete opposite---I actually had to abandon my intended major because I wouldn't be able to retake certain classes plus all of the other ones I needed to take and graduate on time. Now I am stuck with a major I honestly don't care about at all, enjoy, and leads to nothing (especially since I don't have the grades for any grad program in the entire world). I was even on academic probation one semester (which honestly didn't really affect my life at all as no privileges were taken away from me) but did get off it (not with outstanding grades, but bare minimum or higher to be off it)

I am part-time this semester (had enough credits that I didn't need to take any more, and if I did, it would cost money) and am taking 2 classes, both of which are required for my major. For major classes, you have to get a C or above for it to count (believe me, I already had to retake two....). I just got my midterm report and I have a D because I apparently bombed our midterm (the only grade so far except for homeworks, which I've done well on). What I'm really upset about is that I was honestly shocked and thought I had done an alright job. That is how every single test, paper, etc. in college has gone. If I went in and literally knew nothing and froze up and made something up, yeah, I'd expect a fail. But that's never happened to me. I do feel like I put in work but I just don't get results for whatever reason.

Anyways, I went to talk to the professor today, and honestly, reviewing the midterm doesn't do shit since it's material we won't be tested on for the final, and every question is sort of situational to itself. But I sat there and she told me what I did wrong, not that it would help me for the final (don't know how to explain since I know some people will challenge this statement, but it's just not carryover material/processes/etc). 

Okay so here's where we get into the real question: so I am in a huge crisis here. If I even get a C- I won't graduate. My parents live in another CONTINENT for that matter, and I can't ask them to buy plane tickets for graduation and then tell them I'm not actually graduating the day after the final. I told her of course I know she can't just ""give"" me a C, but I just don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong and like I said, everything is situational to itself, so nothing we've done will help me. 

So I'm honestly pretty suicidal over the idea of not graduating because a) clearly something has gone wrong that I'm unable to identify since this has been consistent for years (my guess is maybe adult ADHD? I am diagnosed, but that was about a year ago and the past wasn't really discussed in my diagnosis) b) I really need to get out of the school environment c) no degree = no job = no money = no way to survive.

More context: I have been depressed since I was 10, chronic anxiety since then too, developed social anxiety a few years ago as well. So suicidal feelings are't new, but I feel like my depression keeps snowballing from bad things happening, like this.

So question: What happens if a student were to hypothetically say they were suicidal in a professor's office, for example? I am curious simply because students are 18+.

I'm sorry this got too mental health-y but I am genuinely curious as to what the scenario is like.

**TL:DR feel like I am working hard yet poor results, on the brink of not graduating, panicking because need to get out of a school environment and parents need to potentially buy plane tickets for grad**",0,2016-04-06 22:16:41,AskAcademia
bynxzp,academia-anxiety,t2_3x1tcbi2,Dropping bachelor's thesis on hardship?,"I'm currently working on my bachelor's honor's thesis. I was supposed to have it finished by now, but took an incomplete because I had some (mental) health issues/family issues bubbling up my second semester of the yearlong process that got in the way of my thesis. I opted into the honors program which requires the thesis, which just requires an extra class + thesis over the regular program. 

However, I had issues with my thesis almost immediately in the fall semester I started it. My advisor's area of focus is not at all what my proposal was for. My advisor has also been incredibly condescending/mansplainy to me, asking circling rhetorical questions and providing no actual feedback or critique, which I've asked for in several different ways in case it was a communication thing. In an entire year, he has recommended me one book to read. We've had conversations about teaching/learning styles and approaches. 

For what it's worth, I'm doing a cultural studies thesis on a marginalized community's fandom engagement with three different media texts. I wanted to have a more ethnography-inspired approach, but my advisor has lead me in zero directions. A 15 minute meeting with an old prof I had once lead me down more prospective paths and I came out with a short reading list -- more than my advisor did in two whole semesters. 

After talking to my thesis advisor and academic advisor, I took a temporary incomplete to have an extra semester + summer to finish. 

However, here's the icing: already this summer I've been informed that both of my parents have (different) terminal illnesses. One parent is going into a sort of hospice center, and the other is in treatment for cancer. 

I really, at this point, do not have the oomph or unemotional logistical time to keep working on this thesis, especially with the advisor that i currently have. Is this worth talking to somebody (academic or thesis advisor?) about dropping my thesis? 

I'm hoping on, eventually, going for a master's (library science). How harmful would a big ole DROP note on my transcript look -- or is this something where potential applications might include a ""anything else about you?"" section where I could explain that?

The main contribution of this paper is that it recognizes the rising presence of anxiety in college students and the author, seeks to curtail this rise by addressing it via establishment of an intervention program.

**Strengths**

· This paper targets a very specific and relevant population that needs intervention regarding anxiety.

· Your paper is well-organized making it easy to follow from one aspect of your paper to the next.

· Your placement of assessments before and after intervention suggest you’re aware of the requirement to have more than one assessment in order to evaluate the effectiveness of your program.

· **All** of your sources are **relevant to the purpose** of your paper and **current**.

**Constructive Criticism**

· Your introduction lacks clarity and focus – I’m not able to ascertain the purpose of your paper until **Section BII**: “In order to get to my personal goal to decrease anxiety in college students…”

· The paper is supposed to address the **Millennial generation**, yet there are zero references in your paper to Millennials or Generation Y.

· Since your paper is about decreasing anxiety in college students, Anxiety Disorder cannot function as a risk factor for itself. (**Section AI**)

· Section **BI:** “Researchers have suggested that one way that can help students benefit of succeeding college would be to take a course that can help them learn different study techniques…” I am confused as to how study skills are a protective factor against anxiety in itself. This requires a more in-depth explanation as there seems to be a gap missing in study skills to anxiety relief. 

· Your protective factors only seem to be geared towards academic anxiety—a very specific form of anxiety, yet your paper doesn’t specify any distinct types of anxiety. **Was your purpose to attack academic anxiety only or anxiety as a whole?** Please clarify.

· While the point of the paper is stated to be decreasing anxiety, there are a few statements that can confuse the reader in to thinking that the purpose of the paper is to help students graduate. While anxiety and its relationship to ability to graduate may be related, they are not synonymous and should not be confused as such.

· **There is no quantitative information in your outline to substantiate your claims**.

**Minor Comments**

· Your in-text citations are incorrect. Stacked/Double parentheses in your introduction are not necessary.

· Use hyphens to join words or parts of words (e.g. open-ended in BI, well-being in Ba, self-report in Bc.)

· There is incorrect spacing in your bibliography.

· There are some minor spelling and grammatical mistakes, albeit non-distracting to the reader.

I’m being homeschooled (self-teaching) by my own choice. Passed all the finals with flying colors, so I’d say I’m reasonably capable academics-wise. I just can’t stand the bureaucracy, numbness, and pointlessness of my country’s school system. One is left with no choices and decisions to make, no agency, forced to sit through listening to extremely outdated and mind-numbing things. Thus I quit. 

As long as I remember myself, I’ve been an independent free-starter who enjoys little to no supervision, having flexible schedules, and working on my own. Now I’m in doubts. 

Is the academic lifestyle a good fit for someone like me? I’m scared of the thought of eventually spiraling into having even more mental health instability and problems than I already have now. 

I’m not even sure I’ll be happy with having to attend lectures every day, it’s just not my cup of tea and I learn absolutely nothing this way, as opposed to teaching stuff myself.

8fmrcd,genesis05,,What is generally required at a minimum to pass a senior/honours thesis?,"Long story short, this past year I did a two-semester senior thesis in an area of machine learning.  90% of the work I did this semester ended up being scrapped about a month before the due date as I was debugging some code for an outrageously long amount of time and was running out of time to even begin getting my results.

Despite this, I am confident that the new approach that I developed is just as well researched and justified in terms of the motivations and context of the problem I'm solving. The only problem is that I haven't had time to implement the approach and apply it to the problem being solved (i.e., my results and discussion sections are currently empty).

I'm kind of hopeless at this point because my life has been centered around this thesis for the past 8 months and have probably put in close to 1500 hours on it, all the while my other grades have been suffering, let alone my physical and mental health. My supervisor has refused to give me information about what is ""passable"" after being asked several times this past month so i'm turning to you, reddit.

The thesis proposal (due in the first semester) was worth 40% which I did well on, and I had an  oral presentation worth 20% which I did alright on. With the remaining 40% being accredited to the final thesis report itself, comparing this to ""traditional"" classes where a 51% is enough to pass the course, I feel like I should be okay.

Are senior thesis's usually strict pass/fails or do I have a chance of passing?

6r0tdx,academiaquestion1,,"Trying to petition for removal of grades due to hardship. I made a mistake and finished my courses while dealing with domestic violence and severe mental health issues. I received C-'s, but the grades were really way lower & the result of teachers curving/bumping grades (sometimes for whole class).","**Background**: undergraduate who has faced numerous obstacles, including domestic violence, homelessness, and severe mental health issues. Trying to appeal for withdrawal/removal of grades from past semester(s).

**Story**: My registrar's office rejected the first appeal on the grounds that 1) C-'s aren't low enough for removal (I wish I had known and not tried!) 2) severe domestic violence and severe mental health issues aren't severe enough circumstances.

Rejected petition in hand, I went to every academic and counseling resource I could find at my school, asking for advice. All the university officials seemed scared to give me advice on my case, as though they didn't want to break any rules by helping(?) me too much. One lady *did* tell me that I should try soliciting letters from professors.

So now I've emailed two professors, asking for help.

One of these professors gave me a C- in a class where my otherwise D/F-grade was bloated by extra credit/work. He also had a TA to whom I had mentioned my anxiety. Remembering these things, I asked him to write a note explaining that 1) my grade was a ""pity grade"" and 2) that I had mentioned anxiety to the TA. He tersely replied by refusing to acknowledge that he gives out ""pity grades,"" and then he said that the TA doesn't remember me mentioning anxiety.

Frustrated but persevering, I emailed a second professor--this one a private music teacher whose classes I received A's in. I've mentioned that I've dealt with domestic violence, homelessness, and mental health issues to this professor before. She has a pessimistic personality, thinks mental health issues are a scam, and discourages a lot of students from their career and academic goals. But, nonetheless, she's the professor I've known best and longest. So I asked her for a note supporting my petition. Discouragingly, she ignored all the personal circumstances I informed her of and instead threw out insults, lambasting me for ""trying to raise my GPA."" In the end, she has now told me she's only willing to write a ""short note"" speaking to my ""character and honesty."" But she also admonished me and insisted that my actions are misguided and going to result in a rejected appeal ""because [I'm] just trying to raise my GPA.""

**Conclusion/help request**: So, at this point, I've faced myriad obstacles, but I'm desperately trying to figure out *how to strengthen my appeal's case*. My school told me that this second appeal is my last chance at the matter. I'm going to ask my private therapist for a note( I'll reuse a note from a previous university therapist; and I'll have a note from this other pessimistic professor. The notes from the school therapist and private therapist will likely only say ""we saw this patient on (dates way after the bad semesters),"" because of their medical regulations or what have you.

- What more can I do to strengthen my case?

- How should I phrase my appeals letter?

- How can I get the committee to understand the gravity of the situation? My private circumstances remain tenuous, for example, and I am dealing with violent people on my personal life.",0,2017-08-02 01:17:33,AskAcademia
