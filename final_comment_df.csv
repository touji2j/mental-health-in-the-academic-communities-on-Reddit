For me, it helps me deal with my mental health and actually helps me focus. I think that just speaks to the fact that it impacts people differently. My advice is to know yourself and know your limits. Sometimes that comes from good and bad experiences, so be cautious.

Not once in here do you mention what you enjoy studying, or areas you are thinking about focusing a PhD on, or the career goals that need it. You do write a great volume about your relationship with your family. 

We have to fix ourselves. There's not a magic bullet list do these items and you will be happy and have everything you desire. 

The questions you are asking about how to be more social, how to make friends, how to come to terms with your parents and childhood, those are all beyond the scope of this board. 

If you have insurance they should be able to refer you to a therapist, check your insurance webpage. A general doctor can also refer you to a therapist if you feel more comfortable going that way. There are online mental health services and support groups. There are text, phone and chat hotlines. Depending on what country you live in there are a variety of programs out there. You may not immediately going to click with your therapist, you may have to shop around and try several therapists until you find one you can work with well. It's a long process, it's a hard process.

fukin31,t3_h188i9,True,ayayay_sassypants,t2_4e582e7s,"You are asking good questions. I wish I had all of the answers for you, but  I can tell you I relate with the relative isolation and limited network compared to other doctoral students. Part of why I can't help too much to answer your questions is that I was so oblivious to race as a factor in my own life for a long time--sounds weird, right? For that reason I can offer myself as an ongoing resource, but can't at this point really pin-point very many ways my race has interfered. 

One example I realized recently is that I often had to seek mentorship from senior folks/ faculty. Very few assumed in undergrad (small university) that I would be looking to a PhD and research-oriented long term, but at that time I already had my sights set. Looking back and knowing what I know now about teaching and mentorship and my own performance relative to my peers, it is surprising so few people asked about future plans and that so many people were surprised or felt the need to comment on how well I did. Still, few thought support me towards aspirations, guide me, or give me an encouraging nudge. I am especially thankful for one teacher in particular for doing this; she was a person I asked for letter of rec.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Anyway, I am determined to not let it stop me, but given how unjustifiably uncomfortable people get around me... a part of me feels afraid, and dare I say a sort of resentment towards myself for making this more difficult than it needs to be.

You've got the right idea and awareness going in, which I think can make a huge difference. If you don't mind, I'll share what I would go back and tell myself if I could go back in time: 

* trust your gut for not only following what others think are good opportunities, as your inexperience is made up for by your gut; 
* ask questions and try to demystify or concretize aspects of the culture of academia and your field as you focus on the training; 
* set aside time and energy for self-care and socializing, with an intentional effort to developing friendships or accessing outlets that nurture your culture and ""true"" self that you don't have a chance to relate to others with in your program (probably); 
* relish that you do get to play and have the cognitive challenge and nurture that part of you in the PhD program;
* find out if counseling is available through a health center or other program. Parts of PhD can be alienating and isolating by nature and regardless of your background. This has the potential to be magnified for you if you've already experienced some of this. Mental health problems too often develop among graduate students, so if you can afford to see someone regularly to help you transition into the program, I think that would be a good preventative move. 
* Consider how much you want to help people be more comfortable with you, or maybe you'd prefer to focus on the job at hand/common ground. Maybe that is a therapy topic. Basically, I think you might do well to play with how you handle this time around what you found to be a challenge in the past. 

I wrote this rather quickly and realize it's long. It's so long I didn't re-read for corrections, so feel free to reach out of any of this doesn't make sense. If you'd like to stay in touch just to have someone to talk to that understands where you are coming from, I imagine that would be mutually beneficial. My direct supervisor and advisor tend to ascribe to ""colorblindness,"" if that gives you any idea how many people I have around that know what this is like. 

I do think there are enough of us here to create a community, though we may be spread all across the globe. I have finally started to make time to seek out peers I have more in common with to try not feeling as lonely. Hopefully better late than never.",1,2020-06-12 05:25:03
ftpa48m,t3_h0yz79,True,Snowpossum,t2_738vw,"My university has stated they will continue normal cleaning procedures to reassure us. I've gotten random fungal problems from their seats. Airborne disease was also rampant to begin with. Not only will they not be wiping down desks between student use but they've already proven in the past that they can't really contain airborne issues. The cold and flu are rampant. They won't contain this and I give it 4 weeks before we start seeing entire classrooms get sick. Normal cleaning procedures are the bare minimum and staff and students are expected to clean when they see a problem, if they are proudly sticking to procedure the outcome is inevitable... Our area has also tried to open and then been shut down a week later multiple times now. We're not containing it. Large swathes of students are destined for a poor education because they'll be beyond sick, and our university is not only increasing tuition but made it clear they won't be giving refunds. If the student body wasn't made up of 70% subservient premeds begging for their med school prereqs from staff that absolutely adore the asskissing, there would be a protest. They even took down the article for our school news just the other day that was telling people they were increasing the tuition. They know they're in the wrong and trying to contain it. My school hasn't even gotten through summer semester and they're already doubling down and covering with damage control. At this point I can't help but think me and my fellow students are doomed to mediocrity. Upper staff have treated it all as a joke when approached. When I mentioned the issue with student mental health the one I trusted most directly told me ""we don't have grad students with mental health problems."". They genuinely are clueless and uncaring to anything going on. Their white towers were silly before, but now they're risking other people for it. I was on the wall before with them but covid has shown the crack in their masks and made me as a student lose complete faith that they have anything at all under control or that they care even in the slightest about their students. So no I don't see how they'll pull this off and I predict it will take a death to make them see the problem with the way they've treated this event.

fto90az,t3_h0nsi8,True,implausibility,t2_bs9vf,"Aw, you sound like such a kind person! When I was in high school (I’m from Canada), I was super focused on my studies and had barely any social life. I continued that way for a couple of years into university, too, but I got to a point where I was so lonely and my anxiety was at an all time high. I decided to do a full 180 for third year and actually prioritize my mental health and making new friendships. It seriously helped so much and I’m now in an amazing Master’s program and so much happier.

Although it feels like secondary school is the most important thing ever right now (I remember that feeling so well), my advice is to prioritize your overall self. Work hard at school, but also take breaks for hanging out with friends, exercise, and de-stressing especially since you deal with OCD. It’ll really prevent burnout and you still have your academic whole career ahead of you to work hard. You’re also already ahead of a lot of people because you know what you want to do, I didn’t know until my third or fourth year tbh. 

I think a good plan would be to just get into the best university you can with the grades you end up with. Universities also care about improvement through school and your overall potential and goals, so really stress that in your application since you already have incredible drive. Then, once you get to university, think of it as a fresh start. Get to know profs outside of class, ask about research opportunities, and learn as much as you can, but also take care of yourself. By the time you’re looking at grad schools, you’ll be in excellent shape and no one will care  at all about your secondary school grades.

I’m a computer scientist, so I can’t give you much in the way of resources, but it seems like you’re on the right track with your tutor. You’ll get there, I promise. :) Feel free to DM me if you want to chat more!

Edit: Btw, you feeling like a poser is called imposter syndrome and everyone I know in academia has it. Even profs who have been in the field for 40 years think they don’t belong with their fellow profs. I was struggling with it super hard this year, but I tried to reframe it as me being excited to learn. I could avoid reaching for my goals because I’m scared I don’t belong, or I could take it as an opportunity to learn from the really smart people around me. Then, I’m always improving which is really the best we can ask ourselves to do.",1,2020-06-11 07:21:03

His death led to the uncovering of systemic abuse by the professor toward other students and post docs over years and years.

ftag002,t1_ft8xxm0,True,YourMomSmellsNice,t2_46j2i95,"Well, it was not one isolated event, but the overall exhaustion that came from it. I got the dog out of a combination of loneliness (even though I had a roommate) and a very bad breakup. I figured that the dog would be good for my mental health and, you guessed it, would ensure that I got outside more.

What I really got out of having a dog was more anxiety. I ran out of people I could ask to babysit (having a roommate helped a bit but she was busy as hell... and doggy hotels are not always an option on a grad student budget), walking the dog for his potty breaks ended up being more taxing than I expected, (it is daily, and you have to do it regardless of weather, your deadlines, or your own health), and just the constant worry of leaving the dog alone for too long made me both feel anxious and guilty for not being a good dog owner. At some point I tried just working from home instead of the office, but it further isolated me from labmates, friends, my advisor, and collaborators that I would regularly see in the building. Also, just like a lot of people who are now working from home during the pandemic, the dog would not let me concentrate even when it was in its crate. I won't even go about the overall cost of owning a dog, or the extra logistics that it needs when you move apartments/get into relationships/take a weekend trip/get an internship/go to a conference.

So yes, I got a dog that ensured I took breaks, but it also could not get out of those breaks on days that I needed to either have some rest or work more than usual.

It seems however that you really want a dog and you may be looking into success stories. While it didn't work for me, the times I saw it work was with friends that had gotten a dog with someone else (because they could split chores, finances, and schedules), or people that didn't mind spending a significant chunk of their time and income on the dog instead of themselves. The one friend that got a dog by himself was happy about it but made a ton of sacrifices around the dog. 

Out of 5 friends with dogs, 4 got their dog on their last year of school. All of them, however, admitted that a dog came with sacrifices. Out of those 4, 3 have graduated and find it much easier to care for their dogs because they earn more and they have a more flexible schedule.

Bottom line, I heavily suggest that you keep your sight on the prize: graduation. Focus on the number one goal so you can get out soon. Then you can own a dog in a less stressful environment.

The underlying factor for why things did/didn't work in relationships during my PhD had to do with the equivalence of passion in the other person's life for SOMETHING.

If the other person is super passionate about something (job, hobby, etc), then they will understand where you're coming from when things come up. That being said, you have to also be okay being with someone who might have things come up.

To be clear, for me, relationships with people who were not passionate about something did not work out for me.

fsykrxi,t3_gx04z2,True,GugaAcevedo,t2_41u15are,"Hi! Sorry for my long answer!  
You are asking if they are ***seen***  as lesser in the US, not if they effectively are. In my personal opinion, and based on the experiences of several friends and people I know, the answer **is yes.** I am doing my PhD in Europe, and even my supervisor thinks that the US PhD's are better, so from the ***perception*** side, it may be true.  Do I believe it? Of course not.

So let's analyze it, so you can have an answer for people who tell you this:

Time:  As you said, while in the US you can go directly from BSc to PhD, in Europe you usually can't.  In fact, you need a 1 or 2 year MSc diploma before applying to the PhD, which means that your total graduate studies can take between 4.5 to 6 years, which is similar to the US. So, regarding the duration, the person who told you that, is wrong (but we already know that).

Quality: Regarding the quality of the program, I think that in any place of the world it will depend on the university, your talent and dedication, and your supervisor. If you check the QS rankings, you will se that in Top 26 (there's a tie in #25), 13 are in the US, and 13 are outside of the US, if you make that Top 50, then the ratio is 19:31 (19 in the US). This says 2 things: the first one, is that the US does have a very good tertiary education system when we talk about elite institutions; the second one, is that there are many elite universities outside of the US. The UK (where you are) has 9 universities in the Top 50 of the world, so if you analyze it in a per-capita basis, it seems to have the best university system in the world. In fact, if you are studying in one of the universities of the Russell group, your degree is among the best you can get in the world in your field. 

Publications: This is where it gets tricky. In Europe, specially in continental Europe, the focus on publications is less than in the US. While in the US people focus on having journal papers, in Europe many universities see the dissertation as the main focus. Again, this will depend on your supervisors, but I do know people who have finished a PhD in Europe with just 1 conference paper. This only means that the requirements for graduation in some doctoral schools may be lower than in the US; nevertheless, I have seen people graduating with 4-5 peer reviewed journal articles in the same doctoral school. So, it's up to you.

Working hours: I think this is a key part. In Europe most of the times you are an employee of the university, and as such you're expected to work 40 hours per week. I have worked with people who spent some time of their PhD's in the US, and their working hours increase on average 15 hours. This of course means that a PhD student in the US can make 25%-35% more research than her/his European counterpart. The cost? Usually mental health. 

The US ""We are the center of the world"" mentality: Ask anyone outside academia, and even in academia, about ETH, EPFL, TUM, LMU, UCL, Sorbonne, and most of them will not have a clue about those universities, even though all of them are Top 50 in the world. Being the largest economy in the world and the most powerful country, may lead some of its people to neglect the rest of the world, and be ignorant about it. You will find a lot of people like this, for example the prof you told us about. 

As you can see, the quality should be approximately the same. The time to graduate is similar, there are top institutions in the UK, you can publish as much as you manage, and work as long as you want. What you cannot do, is beat the ignorance that US academia has about the academia in the rest of the world. Therefore, if you want to be a professor in the US, it would be easier to think about doing your PhD in a university in the US; or in  university in the UK that is very well known in the US (Oxford, Cambridge, UCL, LSE).  If not, you can take the harder path, and explain to ignorant people, why a UK PhD can be as valuable, or more, than a US PhD.",1,2020-06-05 10:44:48

You’ve worked hard to get to where you are so obviously you want to have those years work to lead somewhere. However, I’d say your physical and mental health are a priority right now. Without sound health, you will have difficulty with your job. 

You likely have a number of options: 1) look for a related, but low stress job to get insurance and take care of yourself, 2) leave academia for now and look for industry opportunities, 3) look for a completely unrelated, low stress  job for a year or two...etc. 

It’s easy to think that the decision you make now will haunt you for the rest of your life. That’s a lot of pressure. Take the pressure off yourself by making a 1-3 year plan that you will re-evaluate when you are in a better place. There isn’t that much in life that can’t be made up. Yes, if you ultimately decide on academia, you may have to start further back than you would have, but that’s a small price to pay for regaining your life back. 

On a personal note, significant health issues caused me to rethink a lot of my life. Academia had been my dream. It took a long time to get where I am. Quite frankly, now I think this job sucks. It sucks life out of you (hello bragging overworkers), it sucks time out of you, it sucks humility and compassion out of you. It sucks a sense of being valued out of you. Of course, that’s not the case for everyone. I’m just saying that your past goals and expectations may be changed from your experiences. It’s okay to make new goals and set new expectations. What you want from your life is more important than what others think you should want from your life.

I agree with /u/CerebralBypass that this appears to go beyond general malaise. Although you turned down an offer, you feel unmotivated, unable to make a decision, unsure whether your decisions are meaningful, uncertain of what alternative paths to pursue, and uninterested in pursuing said paths.

I'd also note that by turning down a tenure-track appointment, you've already begun closing the door on academia. Word will absolutely get around that you turned down the job (but not for another offer). It's not (generally) because people want to be mean. It's because departments want to protect themselves from people who demonstrate, for lack of a better word, flaky or puzzling behavior.

You wasted a lot of people's time and energy by applying for a job you refused. These hires take a tremendous amount of committee work. I'm ***not*** saying declining was the wrong choice. I ***am*** saying there are professional consequences. The chances of garnering a TT position in almost every discipline is close to zero, regardless of pedigree. (I'll note there are a few exceptions, such as nursing.) It's not impossible, but it's unlikely you'll get more offers, especially with the unforeseen impact of COVID. But this is ok.

There are many, *many* good reasons to leave academia (and truthfully, most people either get squeezed out or left on the margins as horrifically exploited adjuncts). So, ***the issue isn't really about how or why or when to leave academia. The issue is that you feel extremely apathetic and directionless.*** You also feel ashamed enough that you lied to your advisor. So, you lied about something that they will likely learn the truth about later. I really encourage you to try therapy. It will also help you to move past concerns about disappointing others.

We ***severely overestimate*** how much people care about our decisions. Your advisors, like you, are primarily concerned with themselves (and perhaps their spouses and children). They rarely think about you when you're not physically present. Good advisors have good boundaries. We respect the decisions our students make. We respect these decisions not just because we are able to individuate, but also ***because your choices have zero impact on my life.*** (The only exception is if all of my students fail out of the program. If none of them gets a job, that's explained by the terrible job market.)

You might have to meet with one or more therapists before you ""click"" with someone, but be aware that in your present state, you may not *feel* like you click with anyone. In that case, just stick with one person for multiple sessions to give yourself a chance to make progress.

But you need to take responsibility and learn how to set appropriate professional boundaries. If she responds to your email with abuse, there is no reason for you to respond to it! There is no reason to agree to a meeting with her if you do not trust her to behave appropriately. 

I understand very well that junior academics depend on the relationships and funding from PIs, but it cannot be at the expense of your integrity. That is shortsighted, even if you only consider your own reputation and career—and it’s unethical, besides. 

I agree with another response that said you should seek therapy, which can support you in learning to set boundaries and have difficult conversations. It could also support you in finding work that you actually believe in. Good luck.",1,2020-05-30 15:54:32
fs8sg3n,t1_fs8d1g5,True,synthesis-synthesis,t2_3ev125pt,"In your original post you explicitly stated that **she is not paying you**. This is partly why I emphasized ethics rather than metrics. Your ability to pay your bills and feed yourself isn't dependent on this article; I would assume it's not dependent on any single piece of work but, rather, a body of research. 

I want to emphasize again that an anonymous email will accomplish nothing. There's no universe in which a researcher allows some unidentified rando to dictate what is and isn't published. The editor will assume you are a troll or an unhinged colleague. If, for some bizarre reason, they bother to read your take-down closely, ***they'll realize it must be the mathematician listed as an author***. Who else would be as familiar with the ins and outs of the computed results?

And it was clear to me from your post that the primary issue is your relationship with this person. That's why I stressed the importance of therapy. You can't change her or how she speaks to and acts towards you. You can only change your own cognitive and behavioral patterns. Again, **a trained mental health professional has strategies they can teach you how to use in order to remove yourself from this person's orbit in a way that minimizes fallout.** 

In response to something you said in another reply: **you should not, under any circumstances, attempt to ""discuss"" her behavior with her.** She's already demonstrated numerous times that she doesn't respect you (or anyone). You ""asked"" her permission (why?) to cut back on your free labor for her, and she bit your head off. That's not going to change.

Other posters have commented that your replies consistently make excuses and resist the consensus about how to move forward. I think you sound anxious, afraid, and unable to imagine alternatives. (Therapy.) **I don't want to dismiss the power asymmetry here.** (More therapy.) However, a few things stand out to me: 

**1)** Just because she helped you early in your career doesn't mean you're obligated to let her treat you like shit nor does it mean you're obligated to make yourself complicit in bad research. Neither loyalty nor debt are at issue here.

**2)** Everything you're doing is driven by fear of confrontation, but you're letting her aggressive narcissism (and your social anxiety) create an inaccurate sense of how much power she exercises. You're not even in the same fields. If she rages, let her rage. (But again, if you want to avoid that as much as possible, get help from a therapist.) 

**3)** Focus on your relationship with your PI. Even though this person also seems somewhat spineless, presumably they are the one who decides whether to renew your contracts, assign you to other, actually relevant projects, etc. 

**4)** Lastly, you seem too obsessed with h factor. Like, clearly her reputation is shit because all these other people have abandoned her, and she can't get any one besides intimidated graduates to support her. *Just because people tolerate someone doesn't mean they respect them.*

fs8aovi,t3_gsyhlf,True,synthesis-synthesis,t2_3ev125pt,"Professor here. This sounds like a lot. I'm sorry you feel stuck in an awful situation.

**An anonymous message will not accomplish anything.** Why would an editor--or anyone--take that seriously? It could be a jealous colleague or frustrated graduate student or an angry ex-spouse. It would either go directly to their spam/junk folder, or they'd delete it immediately. 

**You should contact the journal to remove your name from this work.** Personally, I would explain why, but that decision is up to you. 

I'm surprised that you wrote about the possibility of sticking with this publication because of metrics. What about ethics? The whole point of intellectual inquiry is to contribute to the expansion of human knowledge to the best of your ability. She undermines everyone's efforts when she knowingly disseminates bad work.

Part of being an editor is being competent enough to spot shoddy research. But even if this woman's unsubstantiated (and prejudiced, since it involves phrenology) claims made it past the editor's desk, reviewers would notice the gaps and inconsistencies. She may be ""famous,"" but peer review is double-blind for a reason. (Now, sometimes people can make reasonable guesses about who wrote/reviewed something, but that's less relevant here.)

Finally, I hope you'll consider therapy, which I think is crucial for academics. This environment creates and exacerbates mental health issues at every stage. A trained, impartial therapist would equip you with new strategies for how to deal with this unstable person. 

You can learn how to create and enforce boundaries. You can learn how to say no, both to people you dislike and even people you do like. And you can learn that you have agency over your life. No one can force you to be ""stuck"" in this exploitative situation. 

I understand and empathize with social anxiety. At the same you are also **making a choice** to engage with and work for an incompetent narcissist. Ultimately, the best way to fix this issue in the long-term is to *stop choosing this person's delusions of grandeur over your own intellectual projects and psychological well-being.* That's easier said than done, which is why therapy can help.

My advice is to report him and to seek counseling. Are there counseling services offered at your university? I’d try to find a counselor that specializes in sexual assault/trauma. 

I’ll also offer a parallel from my own experience. When I was an undergrad, I joined a lab where I was sexually harassed by one of our technicians. Being new to the lab and feeling like I was an idiot for not seeing the signs/like I brought it on myself, I was terrified to report it to my supervisor. I thought that I’d lose my position and jeopardize my academic career because it could be construed as a “he said, she said” situation, and that my word would be trusted less because I was new and they didn’t know me as well as him. Eventually, sexual harassment progressed to sexual assault. I was traumatized, still shouldered the blame, was in heavy denial, and in that mindset, thinking that I’d be fired, never said anything for several years, despite working with him the entire time. I became self-destructive over that time because I wasn’t processing the trauma, and I see now that being in that state was more hazardous to my academic career from the impact on my mental health than what he had done. Everything built up and when I was in grad school in the same lab, the stress of graduate studies and all involved brought the whole trauma to the surface to the point where I had to deal with it. At the same time, this tech was starting to harass other women in our dept, one of whom was a close friend of mine who helped me move past denial to realize what happened. After cracking, I told my supervisor what had happened several years before - absolutely sure that it was the end of my graduate studies - and he never questioned my word despite that I didn’t have tangible proof. He fired that technician that same day.

I still regret that I never said anything sooner. If I had, that tech would not have been able to harass other women and put them in the same situation as myself. In hindsight, not processing what happened nearly derailed my academic career. It was severely impacting my studies and I was to the point where I was considering quitting graduate studies altogether.

I hope with all my heart that you recognize your strength and report him. The potential consequences of not reporting him are far worse. Try to talk with somebody you trust (prof, mentor, graduate coordinator/chair, counseling services or sexual assault services at your uni, etc.), as they will have guidance specific to your university and can support you as you find your way through this.

frue00i,t3_gq9zrr,True,explorar_libro,t2_6idv5bi1,"I have been through a mental illness in my childhood, about 15 years from now.
It has not stopped my academia and currently, I am about to end my Phd.
During, my phd there were many life changing personal things, which effected my mental well being, although I was quick to recover.
I was lucky to get a good supervisor, who at least understood.
But, from my experience, I can definitely say that Phd takes lot of efforts not only in your subject but keeping your mental health well too.
It is a challenge that most of the Phd face during their degree and numerous studies are coming up, regarding the concern of the mental health of Phds.
Now, as you are already vulnerable, it will be more challenging for you to cop up with the pressure of a Phd. But, I believe if you want, like you have done in past, you can do it now too.
Be honest with yourself and tell your supervisor clearly, go in small steps, it might take more time for you, but, it's your life, hence, you will be the leader.
Please go ahead what you feel is right for you, it will be a different challenge for you, but, worth it.
I hope this might help.
Please let me know.",1,2020-05-26 05:39:41
frt0z7s,t3_gq9zrr,True,SupSquark,t2_vhfat,"I'll speak from personal experience here. I graduated with my first degree in physics (UK MPhys) last year after four years. For the entirety of those four years my mental and physical health were terrible - I was severely anorexic and threatened with suspension /  being kicked out early.  I've always known I've wanted to do a PhD and had some pretty good friends who reminded me constantly that I was about to die/ really wasn't fit to live alone/move abroad/ survive a PhD the  way I was. 

My transcript for 2nd year was abysmal - we're talking 40% for computational physics with my highest mark being 70% in the easiest exam (still one of the lowest in the class). No information was retained; in fact I have hardly any memories whatsoever. 

When it was time to apply for PhD positions my friends sat me down and made it clear that I had to get better and so I made many attempts with university counselling (which eventually worked), saw a GP etc. but I definitely wasn't fit to do a PhD. The PhD I wanted was 1300km away meaning if I got better, body would ever have to know; it also gave me a timeframe of only 6 months to be physically fit - so no, I didn't disclose to my PhD supervisor that I was (at the time) ill; I still haven't because it's not a huge part of my life anymore however (and this is VERY IMPORTANT) if I were to relapse I would be comfortable in speaking to my supervisor about it. 

Over the 6 months from March - September I worked damn hard on myself. I caught up on physics I'd never learned, gained weight, learned to cook good food and then I was ready to move abroad. I'm not cured by any means - there are still difficult days/weeks/months but my passion for doing physics beats that and there's no way you can fully commit to your passion when you're struggling constantly. Now, nobody would believe just over a year ago I was skeletal and almost dead if it weren't; for my ever more infrequent instagram rants about food.

Those 6 months were crucial and if I were you, I'd make sure you have a sufficient amount of time off before starting another degree. You want to equip yourself for a graduate degree - it's intense, fast past, and often leaves very little time for oneself. You should build yourself a support group of people ho can keep you accountable, look out for you and to whom you can go when struggling. Finally, strongly consider what you'd hope to achieve by keeping your mental health a secret from a potential supervisor - if they judge you based on it, you probably don't want to work with them; ditto if you don't feel like you trust them with the info. Supervisors are mentors and will want to know you personally, if you try to mask your mental health you run the risk of not establishing as good a relationship as is possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Best of luck! If you're passionate - go for it. You've done incredibly well to get this far already.",2,2020-05-25 21:13:14
frt0or9,t1_frrayod,True,OutrageousReasons,t2_3qvem5ue,"That is a great response from your mentor. He respected your honesty and acknowledged your aptitude for knowing what's best for your mental health and long-term productivity.

I hope everything works out well for OP. Not to be a downer, but worse case scenario...

I did the same thing with my PI last week. Explained that I was stressed out by him asking for manuscript updates every few days with all the edits corrected from him days before, in addition to edits he makes during our weekly Zoom meeting. I told him if we set a deadline (end of the month) that I would have a great, non-typo'd version for him to completely edit. I won't go into details, but we argued via email all week (which stressed me out even more). We eventually agreed that I could have until the end of the May to finish (6 days away), but I wasted a whole week arguing with him about it and being so upset about the situation that I lost more time on it than if he had just said ""Ok.""

Hopefully every else has mentors who are supportive in these awful times of uncertainty and best wishes for everyone to be safe and healthy.",1,2020-05-25 21:10:39
frsn8m1,t1_frsf4nl,True,thoughtcity,t2_h9yet,"I will add onto this comment: the experience is also very overwhelming, almost all of the time. There always seems like there is more that you can be doing. Even when I feel like I may busting my ass, I may still feel like I'm not doing enough. Whereas with a set of classes, the goal is a lot more clear and success is more tangible: to get good grades and to learn so that you can potentially apply the knowledge. But as a PhD student, those milestones are less concrete and sometimes feel like they are always out of reach. I have found that even if my experiments are working, and I'm spending a lot of time in the lab, there is a plethora of literature that I'd like to go through, which is only ever a growing list. And reading literature gives rise to ideas that I'd like to try in the lab. Then there are seminars that I may not have time for, or opportunities to network that I may not have the energy to attend.

The constant criticism is also difficult to handle, especially when mental health is at a low. I have found few things more soul-crushing than pulling long hours to prepare something in spite of being at the edge of a mental breakdown, only to have the project ripped to pieces and scrapped because there isn't the right kind of information available for us to use it. While the logical side of the brain recognizes that it isn't really your fault, it's still really rough to see 100+ hours amount to a scrapped project.",4,2020-05-25 19:12:18
frsff85,t3_gq9zrr,True,AnxiousSuccotash7,t2_3q0vf4ba,"Great answers in this thread. I just graduated from undergrad and experienced one major mental health episode where I considered taking time off. Instead I stayed on and my grades dropped - just the consequences of a decision I made. Luckily I did not fail anything, but 100% will explain that semester as mental health issues. I am in the US for reference.

I am in the natural sciences and am thinking really hard about PhD/academia. I do think I would be successful bc of how much of a nerd I am and my work ethic, but the stress associated with a PhD is seriously turning me off. While I’m years away from actually deciding on a PhD (masters first), I am making all my educational decisions by putting my mental health first. Because if I’m a mess in school I won’t be at my best and will not be able to handle it! Mental health is nothing to mess around with when it comes to school and career.

I think making peace with not being a ‘traditional’ student is important - being able to accept that things can be harder for me to handle but I WILL get through them no matter what. Finding an understanding advisor is a requirement. Also, at least in natural sciences, I don’t necessarily have to work in academia to satisfy the curiosity that I have. In the US there are government agencies I can work for where I can do research that matters, for example.

Hope this helps - just my anecdotal experience.",2,2020-05-25 18:04:21
frru947,t1_frrs7nl,True,purporte,t2_69piyhl1,"Thank you kindly for your detailed response, I have heard the environment can be quite toxic in academia, not sure exactly why that seems to happen across so many universities. 

I definitely am not discouraged, I really appreciate the advice and am open to as much information as I can get before committing to anything. I have a really good relationship with my current supervisor so he knows of my struggles. I will be going into industry for 6 months in the next few weeks and he believes I'm fully capable of doing a good job, but if the environment prevents me from becoming more confident, he suggests not staying on after the 6 months, so perhaps the the PhD environment may be one of the reasons he had reservations. 

Thank you for congratulations also, I didn't really think it was that amazing until I looked back at where I started from! I'm glad to hear that you know people who haven't let their mental health stop them for progressing in academia, it's definitely something that has been used to put me down throughout the years so hearing this certainly helps! Hope your PhD programme goes well! That's a very cool area of research.",1,2020-05-25 14:59:45
frrs7nl,t3_gq9zrr,True,__eudaimonia,t2_5s0jzr9s,"Hi there, first of all I just want to say well done on continuing your educational journey through bachelors and into postgrad! There are likely more people within academia with diagnosed mental health conditions than you may realise. I am doing my PhD in clinical psychology, so I recognise that perhaps the departments I’ve studied/worked in may be more accepting of disclosing one’s mental health status (although I would hope that the same would be true everywhere). I have friends and colleagues doing PhDs who have diagnoses, and so please don’t let that alone be a barrier to you accomplishing your dream. Regarding your first bullet point, it would be fine to explain the gaps as time you needed to take off for your mental health. I suspect that it would be considered discrimination to reject an applicant solely based on disclosure of a diagnosed condition. 

While this shouldn’t stop you, I’d advise you to really think about whether academia would be a good career path for you and for your mental health, particularly if those who know you well (and love and care about you) are advising you to reconsider. Postgraduate students are three times more likely to struggle with mental health issues; one in two PhD students will experience moderate to severe psychological distress during their degree and one in three will be at risk of having or developing a diagnosable mental health condition. 

I would suggest having a discussion about your future plans with your current academic supervisor (if you feel comfortable to do so). You say that they suggest you seek another career path; it is worth listening to why they think academia may not be the choice for you, and what advice they may have for you. The choice will still be yours, and it may be a difficult conversation to have, but I hope that it will help you with this decision. As you said, it may not be related to your mental health status at all, but having a more sensitive and anxious nature will inevitably make academia feel even more stressful than it already is. There is a lot of toxicity, rejection and competitiveness within academic culture, which may not be the type of environment that you would thrive in. I also want to highlight that it is entirely possible to continue within research without a PhD, particularly in industry/third sector organisations. If anything, having a PhD can be a disadvantage, as organisations can view you as overqualified, whereas a degree such as an MSc can be extremely beneficial. You might want to look into non-academic routes that still have a strong research focus, which may suit you better. 

I hope you don’t feel too discouraged by my reply. You have already demonstrated great resilience by finishing your BSc and working towards your MSc, so this is not to say that a PhD is not for you. It is, however, to encourage you to consider that you may be able to achieve a successful and (more) enjoyable career in research without a PhD and without continuing in academia. Either way, I wish you all the best!",1,2020-05-25 14:39:55

That's a big step regarding personal growth. We are all human and life can hit any of us hard. When I had severe health issues, I would meet a lot of people who clearly thought that this would never happen to them. It's almost as if being sick was my own fault. I could only shake my head and hope for their sake that they'd never have to experience what I went through. Good luck with your health and mental health.",1,2020-05-25 14:28:21
frrqolz,t3_gq9zrr,True,boilerlashes,t2_5x6hlwbw,"Current PI and Director of Graduate Studies here. I'd suggest a couple things: first, sit down with your current supervisor and (if you feel comfortable doing this) ask some more specific questions about why they are suggesting you do not apply for a PhD. Is there something about your output or dedication to the work that is motivating them to say this? For example, in my group I feel the main difference between terminal MS vs PhD students is a type of intrinsic curiosity - is the student going above and beyond? Reading papers and formulating questions related to but outside the scope of their current project? This is the hallmark (in my mind) of a student who will be successful in a PhD program and academia in general. If your supervisor is dissuading you only because of your history with mental illness, then perhaps you can take their advice with a grain of salt. If there is something lacking in how you do your work, though, you should know that now - it could be a reason you decide not to go on in academia, or it could be something you dedicate yourself to addressing before you apply to PhD programs. Your supervisor has both a good perspective on your work and also knowledge of the field and how academia works in general, so try to get as much advice from them as possible. This will also potentially give you a preview of how they will write about you in a Letter of Rec, which is important for you to know now.

If you decide to apply for PhD programs, you can describe your longer than average undergraduate timeline as due to ""medical issues"", which is true, without needing to get more specific. I would hold off on describing your mental health issues in detail until you feel comfortable with and know the people you are disclosing this to. 

Finally, not to dissuade you but just to prepare you - PhD programs can be much more stressful than MSc programs. Be sure you have good support - therapist, psychiatrist, GP - in place before you start any program.",1,2020-05-25 14:24:22

I’m giving myself until the end of this week to see if I can produce a work that’s worth showing or else, I will email them next week to discuss my options. I’m scared but I will do it.

The statement that having a PhD isn’t a life and death situation resonates powerfully with me after experiencing this pandemic in total isolation. It was difficult for me to come to terms with that but this past few months has been been life-changing. I used to have a lot of “what ifs” in my mind especially regarding my funded programme, but I no longer feel as scared. 

Things will be of course be challenging if I decided not to pursue this further. Nobody said it’s gonna be easy but there’s always a rainbow after the storm.

However, living in isolation without any human or animal contact no matter how comfortable your living condition is tough. I’ve moved to a studio for a few months then bam! This pandemic happens.

I’ve been observing the lockdown rules religiously. I started stocking up before everyone started panic-buying as I’ve been following up the situation in my home country where the handling and adherence to the rules are better. I only go out for fresh food but seeing most people not wearing a mask, I feel even more paranoid. 

I was so paranoid that I didn’t even go out to exercise until a few days ago after getting advice from my loved ones and people on here. It felt nice, but I didn’t feel safe. Most people are really being so casual about this pandemic despite being one of the worst-hit countries with one of the most deaths. 

I would be tested as soon as soon as I reach the immigration point and sent to the quarantine centre. If, God forbid I contracted the virus, I’d be taken to the hospital immediately for treatments. I will not see my family until end of June or July depending on my test result, but knowing that I’d be in good hands puts my mind to ease.

I can’t wait to be home where things are under control now. The economy has reopened since a couple of weeks ago but people are still observing the rules. Shops that weren’t following the SOP were ordered to close. It’s nice to know that the country is up and running again without compromising people’s safety.

As /u/tc1991 notes, this was *guidance* by the government. 

If it was impacting your mental health to not be able to take a walk for extended periods, then you should use common sense. 

I'm not trying to be mean, but I'm surprised how few people applied common sense to the situation. As for the academic discussion about legality, it is described in [this document](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/350/made): 

&gt; Restrictions on movement
&gt; 6.—(1) During the emergency period, no person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse.

&gt; (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), a reasonable excuse **includes the need—**

Through the lens of someone making admissions decisions, what they want to see is that you have some applied experience working with people who may have mental or behavioral health challenges, or experience providing emotional support to others in a semi-formal capacity. Some ways in which people have gained this kind of experience include: volunteering with community nonprofit organizations that serve individuals experiencing trauma or mental illness, volunteering in schools / with youth, peer counseling, and relevant jobs (e.g., non-clinical support services at a residential mental health center).

A track record of experience is often helpful. If you haven't yet done the kinds of things that fit into the categories above, you may find it helpful to get a year or two of experiences and then apply for graduate school. Best wishes with your applications!",2,2020-05-21 00:37:56
fr67jvq,t3_gmc5uo,True,banamana27,t2_8bekw,"I'm so sorry you're going through this. Though you're quarantining alone, you are definitely not alone in feeling this way or being in this situation

The other commenters have covered most of it, but I wanted to add a few things. 

1. Your mental health is your top and only priority right now. Set aside your Ph.D.  and any thoughts / concerns about it for now. It sounds like your advisor is really understanding, so they will support a mental health break. 
2. Please, please, please seek counseling. It will give you an outlet to talk about what you're feeling / experiencing that won't be 'burdening' someone else. That's their job. If you don't have access to remote counseling through your university or health provider, there are chat services and crisis numbers that you can use. Don't ever be afraid of calling a  crisis number just because it feels like you're not in crisis. You need someone to talk to, and that's their entire purpose. However, I do highly suggest you find someone who you can get to know and speak to on a consistent basis. It has been a saving grace for me during this time.
3. Go outside. Even if its just on your front porch for 5 minutes. Work your way up to taking a walk around the block. Wear a mask if you're worried about it, but they are finding the rate of transmission outdoors is very low (see the [UC Davis website](https://health.ucdavis.edu/health-news/newsroom/tips-for-enjoying-the-great-outdoors-safely-during-covid-19/2020/04) for more info). Sunshine and a little bit of exercise (even just a short walk) are incredibly important when it comes to mental health.
4. Once you find a more stable mental state, ease your way back in to working. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but the best way to defeat anxiety is to face the situations that make you anxious. Anxiety is a self-reinforcing system. When you avoid something you are afraid of, your anxiety takes that as a sign that you were right to be afraid of it. The more you avoid it, the scarier it becomes. The best way to break out of that cycle is to do small things to ease your fears. Someone else mentioned just sitting at your desk. That's a great way to start. Maybe do something fun (painting, eating lunch, knitting, etc) while sitting there so you associate good things with your desk.",1,2020-05-19 20:48:06
fr5ohnr,t1_fr5ne0r,True,ConstantAide,t2_6gqcv3vz,"I can relate with your comment the most. I have been experiencing a series of unfortunate events in my life since August 2018. This pandemic is just cherry on the cake. However, I really find this pandemic is worsening my mental health. I wanted to have a walk today but I ended up doing nothing as usual. I pretty much have lost my enthusiasm and zest in life. 

I somehow agree with you. Talking to therapist and taking meds don’t work for everyone. I was prescribed with anxiety meds once but they gave me gastric so I stopped taking them. I prefer talking to like-minded people who can actually relate. So far the comments on here have been uplifting and I’m gonna try to come here every now and then for moral support.

fr5o9dj,t3_gmc5uo,True,jamieejamss,t2_n7gtu,"Hi so there have been a lot of really good comments here and I just wanted to add my two cents as a baby academic with mental health and productivity issues!! It’s almost impossible for me to do a lot of the suggestions that other people have done when I’m struggling with executive dysfunction, but what I’ve learned is that watching people be productive and find reward in their hard work gets me so inspired!

I was really struggling to write my senior thesis a couple weeks ago and had no idea how to get myself in the mindset to go near it. I was the same way - too anxious to look at emails, too anxious to do anything academic but just kind of sit and wallow in my anxiety. Then I watched the Netflix documentary about women and women of color running for office in the US (I think it’s something like Tear Down the House?) and specifically seeing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez put in so much hard work, research, and dedication to winning her congressional seat inspired me so much that the next day I started doing work. A month later and I finished my thesis and am now working on more research and not feeling as stuck as I was.

Long story short, I think seeking counseling or some form of therapeutic support is crucial in trying to work through frustratingly ableist expectations of what productivity looks like and what is needed for PhD programs like yours, but I also know that sometimes the only thing you can do is sit and watch stuff or just kind of exist. I’ve put together some videos that help inspire me when I need to get out of a particularly rough episode, so let me know if you’d like me to send you some links that have helped me! If you also need an accountability buddy this summer I’m gonna be working on research for several months so feel free to DM me if you want somebody to check in with you, no judgement attached!

TLDR AOC helped me get out of my executive dysfunction episode",1,2020-05-19 18:11:09
fr5fayt,t3_gmc5uo,True,CaptainChemistry,t2_cb7gd,"I think anyone who has done a Ph.D. has felt some version of this at some point, so you are not alone. It's hard, but we're here for you. Most of my comment will be centered around advice that might help. A lot of good advice has already been shared, but I thought I'd add my two cents. 

1. Atmosphere can help
2. Planning can help
3. No tasks is too small
4. Explore your options

1.  Atmosphere

When I was writing my dissertation, I did most of it from home, which was hard after being in the office for so long with other people. I would even go to the coffee shop just to be around other people. I like my alone time, but sometimes it's nice to be social, even when not directly interacting. Anyway, one of the things that helps me is watching TV that I have seen (many times) in the background of tasks that are not brain-intensive.  This was KEY for me making figures because otherwise, your mind can get away from you. One of my friends and I listen to epic movie soundtracks when we need to get things done. They're just inspiring sometimes. If there is something similar to this that works for you, give it a try. 

&amp;#x200B;

2 and 3. Planning and Details

I used to plan a lot of things in my day in chunks that I now see as too large (e.g. ""write chapter 3"" or ""do XYZ experiment from start to finish""). One thing that has helped me is to break things down into very small, digestible parts, just like individual steps in a protocol or recipe. For writing, I find outlines for each paragraph helpful. Keep going with details until eventually, you have a sentence. Then you can start stringing those together later when you feel good about it.   

4. Options

At times like this, mental health can be hard to take care of. A friend of mine shared this video which I found oddly inspiring/comforting ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snAhsXyO3Ck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snAhsXyO3Ck)). It asks us to improve, which is hard, but it identified boundaries that we might need to carry through this pandemic into our lives after this. I have also found that regular counseling is really important to my continued well-being. I know that this can be expensive, but depending on circumstances with your country, university, family, or personal finances and health coverage, you might be able to benefit. I recently moved from North America to Europe and looked into different options. I have recently been continuing to zoom call with my counselor from my Ph.D. days, but I looked into alternatives when I first arrived. I found that [https://www.betterhelp.com/faq](https://www.betterhelp.com/) (FAQ listed here) offered a range of options, including unlimited messaging and schedules that work for you. The ability to communicate ""constantly"" through chat or to schedule phone/video calls might provide the outlet that works for you. I encourage you (and others) to look into all the options available for working on mental health. It's extremely important and often overlooked in our ""produce epic results all the time/right now"" kind of world. We need our downtime and to recharge, and we need to be allowed/encouraged to take care of ourselves and to have others help us when necessary. 

&amp;#x200B;

I encourage you to stick it out a little longer and to try  some of the things posted in this thread. See if something can work for you.

You're experiencing a mental health crisis, in terms of the disruption to your everyday work that you are experiencing. If you broke your leg and weren't able to get care for it, would you try walking on it every day? It sorta seems like that's what you're trying to do.

Is there a process to take time off from your university for health reasons? Where I am, I could take a month of personal leave or a semester/year of medical leave. Your sponsor likely has no idea what they are inflicting on you. Ask and maybe you will receive.

My heart goes out to you, by the way. I have anxiety and medical-related PTSD and this has been a tough time for me. I spent a couple weeks essentially reading romance novels and doing no work before I got my medication, my meditation, my exercise, and my sleep in order. Or closer to being in order. I also started bullet journaling, which is apparently not about being artsy but is in fact a structured way to approach your goals. I am five years into a phd and was feeling very hopeless because I am so often unproductive for mental or physical health reasons, but bullet journaling has made me feel empowered again. I also was forgetting a lot of things and panicking about that, and now it's just all in one book and I can find it. Maybe some of these techniques can help you too?

One thought: any way you could take a brief leave of absence? Perhaps this would allow you to focus on getting your mental health back on track without the stress of the PhD for a bit. I had to do this at one point during my program (it was a 6-8 week break) and it helped a lot. I also suggest getting a therapist if you can - there are some virtual options out there right now.

fr3ovfg,t3_gmc5uo,True,engelthefallen,t2_6c2hf,"This is actually not uncommon at all.  The problem is it is a vicious cycle.  You want to write, but are stressed out and trying to force yourself to write just stresses you out more.  Repeat this a few times and you now trained yourself to become stressed when you write or think about academics.  So many people fall victim to this cycle but grad school culture does not talk about it at all.  Breaking the cycle is not a one size fits all thing, but step one is to try to notice that you are getting stressed out based on habit at this point.
 
For your own mental health I do suggest talking with someone as they can help you with strategies that work to break the cycle.  There is a sky high suicide rate in academia from students who get into this place that we also do not talk about.  If you need to you can take a leave of absence until you feel you are able to continue your writing.  I had to take two of them.

fr2xx9y,t3_gmc5uo,True,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"I want to give you a (virtual) hug. It's clear that you are really struggling right now. A Ph.D. is difficult under any circumstances, and it is especially difficult in the middle of a fucking pandemic.

Some suggestions:

1. Seek out counseling, if you have not already done so. Most universities have transferred their counseling to teletherapy, so you can still get support. You're aware of your mental health struggles, which is great. There are steps you can take with the help of a professional to manage your anxiety.

2. I encourage you to have an honest conversation with your PI. You don't need to share the full extent of your mental health struggles, but I do think it is worth sharing that you've found it nearly impossible to get work done during the pandemic. I think your PI will appreciate an update on your deadline, and I imagine that you're fearing this communication with them. It may be like ripping off a band-aid, but I think you'll be in better shape having shared your struggle with your PI so that they have an idea of where you're at and, ideally, can support you academically. Perhaps the two of you can work on a revised timeline that feels genuinely realistic for you. Perhaps your PI has suggestions for navigating things. Perhaps your PI is struggling, too, and you will feel less alone. Perhaps your PI would even fully support you taking some time off. I encourage you to have this conversation in real time, if at all possible (i.e., via Zoom or phone).

3. Based on what the degree of anxiety you're describing and your stated desire to go home with family, I think taking a leave of absence is an option worth seriously considering. It would be good to relieve some of the pressure and have the support of family. To be frank, if your anxiety is debilitating enough that you will get very little done, then you might as well get very little done without the daily pressure and feeling of failure from not getting things done, as well as with the in-person support of loved ones. You can always resume your Ph.D. after you've had some time to attend to your mental health and when the pandemic has been more thoroughly addressed.

4. On that note, I encourage you to seek out social support. Talk with friends in your program. Talk with friends and family members in general. One of the challenges of the pandemic has been losing out on the kinds of day to day interactions we count on for support--catching up with a friend, or running into someone in the hallway and telling them about your day. If there are mentors you feel that you can turn to, I encourage you to talk with them, as well. You do not need to go through this alone.

5. I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself. We are in the middle of a global emergency. It makes sense that you feel anxious. It makes sense that you are having trouble concentrating. And although your level of anxiety is higher than the average person's, the kinds of symptoms you're describing (frequent panic attacks, crying spells, difficulty sleeping) are not things you chose. To be sure, there are steps you can take to address these aspects of your mental well-being, but none of this is your fault. We are all struggling in different ways right now, and it's OK that you're anxious and OK that you're struggling. It doesn't make you any less worthy as a person or any less of a good Ph.D. student.

I hope that you can get the support you need, and I wish you all of the best.",13,2020-05-18 23:53:57
fr12ih7,t3_gm1gvd,True,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"I'm sorry to hear that you've experienced an abusive environment with your senior project--there is no reason for a professor to yell at you. Given what you describe--anxiety, burnout, and disruption in eating and sleeping--it sounds like this has had an effect on your mental health. I want to encourage you to get the support you need during this difficult time. If you are still eligible for your university's counseling services, that is one option. If not, consider counseling in the community. If there are faculty or mentors you trust, you might consider checking in with them and letting them know how you're doing.

It sounds like you have already made the decision to drop your senior project. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're close (perhaps just the senior project?) from finishing your degree? And you're looking at what to do from here. We can't make the decision for you, but I can see breaking this down into three options:

1. Stay with the same advisor, and repeat / finish the senior project during the fall semester. If you do this, I strongly encourage you to open up a dialogue about how you're feeling about everything. Ask your professor what you need to do in order to successfully pass your project. This past semester, there is a chance that, for all of your advisor's criticisms, you would have still passed. Of course, it's hard to know, and it makes sense that his communication style would be intimidating. Let him know what you need in terms of clear communication about your progress.

2. If your program allows, you could consider completing your senior project with another faculty member, ideally one whom you trust to be supportive and treat you respectfully.

3. You could leave the program. It would be a shame to do so when so close to graduating. But if staying in this program is bad for your mental health, then it's an option on the table. I encourage you to not make the decision to leave rashly. Instead, explore options to successfully completing your degree.

You say that you're burned out, so please take the time to give yourself the space to rest and recuperate--you owe that to yourself. Best wishes going forward.",1,2020-05-18 14:26:23
fqxste0,t1_fqxpj2l,True,kodakrat74,t2_a5dtc,"Part of what led me to making the changes I did was talking to my PhD mentor more... he pointed out that there is never ""a good time"" to slow down. (e.g., if you land that TT position, the next 6 years will be devoted to tenure, by which at the end of you'll be \~40, then you'll be swamped with committee work, grad student work, etc and half your life will have passed). Many academics never learn to live life outside of work, and they end up clinging on to academia with no life outside of it. I was on that route since I prioritized my work so much in grad school, but it wasn't a healthy way to be.

I also do think it's possible to have success in a postdoc without sacrificing your romantic relationships, etc. I still work hard, I just try to work efficiently rather than long hours.  Another postdoc in my lab and I came in at about the same time. She's my housemate, so I can see how much she works-- and it's pretty much all the time. She does not have friends here, doesn't go out ever, etc. She seems unhappy and struggles with mental health. 

She is about one paper ahead of me. But, I still have 2 papers in the chute after working here about a year. At this rate, in 3 years she'll have \~9 postdoc papers and I'll have \~6. Certainly a difference, and it might be one that lands her to a TT position while I don't get one. But there's so many other factors at play, and my postdoc advisor seems happy with me, so I try not to make comparisons. To me, it's worth it to trade 1 paper a year to have all of the good times with my girlfriend and enjoy my life a little.

You have two supervisors for a reason - do use the secondary one for his purpose. And if you get on very well with supervisor A, then maybe share with them that you feel supervisor B is abrasive or affects your mental health, and ask them to help direct the joint meetings with that in mind to get the most from the relationship - they’ll be very keen to help you and won’t judge, as people managing is well known as one of the hardest parts of a PhD!

That way, we'll willingly sacrifice our physical and mental well-being for the chance to adjunct at three different institutions and teach five classes without health insurance. I think students and faculty struggle most when they buy into this lie and tie their self-worth to academia.

The PI I did my PhD with had many faults, but he was actually good about not feeding into this one because he joined academia later in his life. I can’t believe though how much I bought into it for the past year just by being on the faculty job market and jumping through all the hoops. I have recently scored a permanent position at a national  lab, and while two years ago it would be a dream come true, today I feel like I’m not as good as the two of my colleagues that snapped up faculty positions before the COVID mess.

gbdhbpf,t3_jp9r1v,True,manova,t2_35w8d,"&gt; Research (according to me) can only be done by people who're passionate about the subject, with a good grasp of the subject matter, and high creativity.

There are plenty of people publishing research that don't really care about research and are not particularly engaged in their topic.  They publish research because it is their job and they are doing the thing required by their job.  While I have known some really, really smart people who were excellent researchers, I think the underlying qualities that are common for the best researchers are that they are good writers and good at salesmanship. 

My friends in industry get moved from project to project.  They are not doing research because their passion for the subject, but because they have the right skill set to do their job which is to produce research.  I currently work at a smaller university where teaching is more of a priority.  I would wager at least half of the faculty I work with would be just as happy to never publish another paper again.  They find more fulfillment in teaching or doing administrative tasks. 

All of that being said, if being in their field is affecting your mental health, then it may be time to look elsewhere.  I started in chemistry and while I was pretty good in the lab, I just hated it and could not imagine myself doing it for the rest of my life.  I can remember literally sitting down with the university catalog and looking at every major trying to figure out if there was something else I could do. 

There are two ways to approach this.  Complete your degree but look for employment outside of physics.  Computer programming, finance, or analytics are some examples of fields that would appreciate your strong math background and often recruit outside of their fields.  You can also think of non-research jobs within physics such a being a teacher or science editor/writer/journalism/etc.  The other is to change your major, but you really want to think about how much that would set you back.",1,2020-11-06 18:56:31

If you're not registered or taking classes for consecutive semesters your financial aid eligibility may lapse due to restrictions that the school places on your degree time period and other factors. 

Grad school is different than undergrad. They expect you to finish what you started in a reasonable time and they do not like gap semesters. I had to take a semester off after my father died. This was during my second of four semesters and the process was quite simple. However; other than ""personal"" or ""medical' reasons there really was not an option for taking a gap semester. By personal, most universities mean dealing with personal mental health issues, family member illness/death, and the like. Administratively, universities are not going to like extending an LOA for anything other than those things that would not allow you to finish your program.

Through the collaborations I've had at those other labs (including one in industry), I now have a large ""network"" in my field.

Wfh is hard and not having access to campus resources made it difficult to do my dissertation. It’s so much more difficult to connect with people and my dissertation supervisions were terrible even though my supervisor was absolutely amazing. I don’t know if things will go back to normal by then but I know I’m not in a place where I can start a PhD right now without it being a negative experience. 

So think about it a bit and see if these things are important to you and what you are willing to compromise with.

For me, it's always been skiing and snowboarding.  In high school and college I'd get my lift ticket and spend almost every waking hour from Saturday morning to Sunday night on the slopes, and in college often on weekdays as well (I'd schedule my classes around skiing).  In the third year of my PhD I was in a funk (there's absolutely no skiing any time of the year within driving distance of my university) and was able to get a 4-month visiting student position in a great lab near some pretty good slopes (one of my advisor's PhD buddies was the PI).  

Over those 4 months, I lost a ton of weight, got into the best shape of my life, and (maybe) most importantly, came up with the research that would form the cornerstone of my thesis.  If I couldn't figure out the solution to some problem, I'd put away my computer, get in my car (I always kept my skis at the lab), and go skiing for a few hours.  Sometimes, a possible solution would come to me, and I'd end my ski session and hurry to the lab (or just my apartment) and write some quick code and run it on the server to see if it worked.  

I have grad student friends all over the country, and many of them have an outdoor activity they're obsessed with that keeps them healthy and going strong even in the most stressful parts of their PhD.  Most PIs (in my field) don't care if you take a Wednesday off to go rock climbing, skiing, hiking, cycling, sailing or windsurfing -- for those who enjoy these kinds of activities (and have access to them) I think a PhD is much less taxing on your mental health.

First, I would say, if you can, take a break.  Even if it is just for a few weeks, or a month.  Take some time away from what you're studying and see if you find yourself missing it after time away from it. 

I really wish I had taken some time between my PhD and my postdoc.  With that time I would have reflected on:

1) What I really wanted to do with my life -- particularly in light of what happened to my partner, it is a life changer. For me, it definitely oriented me towards wanting to be involved in the mental health field

2) If I had chosen a postdoc, what was the criteria that I was basing my decision off of, i.e. location, research, institution, supervisor, etc. -- I would have talked to more people about my choice, really explored more

3) My own mental health -- I think because I finished my PhD, I thought I was fine, but there were cracks in the veneer.  The same may not be the case for you, but I wish I'd sought out more consistent counseling and therapy. 

For me now, I wouldn't say I regret sticking with it. My life has been a wildly fascinating and unpredictable road of twists and turns that has taken me to some of the most beautiful places I could have ever imagined, and one thing is true about academia -- I have met some incredible humans. 

Now though, approaching my mid-30s, there are things I want for myself that I feel a bit desperate about -- I want a family, I want stability, I want a job that cares about me as much as I care about it, and a partner who fits the same criteria.  Maybe we can't have it all, but I want to start being serious about how to make these things happen for me, and realistically, I'm not sure if I can do that with academia. I'm in this weird position now where I have a great opportunity in front of me, but I'm so burnt out, I can't even pick it up.

But once (after many many years and painfully conditioning myself to think this way) i started thinking that nothing, and I mean NOTHING is more important than looking after your health (mental and physical), i started to realize it’s ok to quit sth for pursuing another path if that thing is costing you something much more valuable than whatever it is adding into your life. Anyways, i’m sorry abt this weirdly long and maybe slightly poetic reply, but basically what i’m saying is that since I started thinking it’s ok to leave a phd to pursue sth else for a while and try to do a phd again if you want later in life, I have been feeling the lightest i have felt in a long long time.

I believe we have reached this point because of the publish or perish culture mixed with some arrogance and *superioriy of mission* ideology.

She's the type of white woman that acts like an aggressive entitled man and believes putting down other women who aren't exactly like her makes her a feminist hero.
Things really went downhill and became obviously racist when she refused to write me (f, Middle Eastern Descent but born and raised in Germany and German citizen) a letter of recommendation for a prestigious university saying ""I don't think that's really a place for 'someone like you. But no, this isn't about where you are from. It's just your grades and all and you have to be good to get into academia"" (I was top of my class). She and other colleagues also made my life as research assistant a living hell by gossiping, belittling me or excluding me from activities and meetings. Any mistake that was made was immediately blamed on me - even if the usually white person who actually made the mistake admitted it. I was demoted in my tasks over this, spent weeks doing little more than just copying pages and then lost my contract at the department. My mental health went absolutely downhill during that time and I used to get anxiety attacks when I entered the building near this professor's office. This experience really scarred me and I swore that I will do everything I can to become the type of professor that empowers and values her students, and doesn't think putting down other women makes me better.

Of course the students are not the instigators, but that is what a strike does: the employees use the consumers as a pawn. When they complain loud enough, the boss will give in to the demands. 

On doing a refund: it is quite complex: tuition fees pay for a lot of things but let's assume you pay £18000/year as an overseas student. You get roughly 18 hours of lectures every week for 30 weeks. So you are paying £600/week. Not all lectures are spread evenly over the week so some students will miss 5 hours, other 15 hours and so on. Now imagine all the administration you would have to do to refund everyone for missed lectures. And then we are not discounting that part of your fees are going to the library, buildings, equipment, mental health support, cheap food, et cetera. So from that 600 a week, you will get only a small part back and to what expense. The administration will be more flooded with processing refunds and will not be able to help with other things. 

On rescheduling: you will run in problems with space (let's forget about the pandemic and assume you can work at full capacity): lecture halls cannot be double-booked. If you have a class with 100 students, they need a large lecture hall. You cannot teach on the college green. Employment law and health and safety will make it very difficult to teach over the weekend or out of hours. So there are a lot of factors that make rescheduling a very complex thing. 

Students have been on the picket supporting teachers. They understand that staff are being exploited. Students have the right to ask why teachers are on precarious contracts.

Universities and colleges hire adjunct instructors to teach specific courses in specific semesters. Some schools re-hire adjuncts regularly (it’s easier than finding new adjuncts) but technically those are usually one-semester contracts. 

Term assistant professor positions also exist. Those are typically hired one academic year at a time. 

And then there’s tenure-track assistant professor positions, which allow for promotion to associate professor with tenure after 4-7 years, assuming you meet the standards. 

All of these positions have specific requirements that are directly tied to the position description. If I’m hiring someone to teach criminal law, then their training and experience better demonstrate that they can do that.

gf6qzg3,t1_gf6kmbb,True,HumanDrinkingTea,t2_o4xhq,"It's really tragic. It's starts much earlier than you'd think, and in my experience, the brighter the student, the worse it is. 

I used to teach one-on-one piano lessons, and one particular student of mine comes to mind. She was in the 3rd grade and obviously very gifted. The sort of student who had clearly always been the top student in her class and had never had to work to understand anything she'd been taught in school. I remember many instances where I taught her a concept that was years above grade level for her, and she picked up on it without a problem.

One-on-one lessons, in general, are particularly valuable for students who are either very strong or very weak relative to their peers, because it's sometimes the only experience they have where their education is tailored specifically towards their ability level. I teach at whatever level is appropriate for any given individual, because (obviously) this optimizes learning outcomes. 

For this girl, it meant being challenged for the first time in her life. I am pretty sure that my piano lessons were the first time where she was asked to learn at a level appropriate for her ability. This meant that she *didn't* ""get"" everything the first time through. I love this girl to death, but she would be in tears every single lesson. It's hard not to feel like an awful person when you're constantly triggering an emotional meltdown in someone, but she was in tears because making a mistake or getting something wrong clearly challenged her entire sense of self. 

Fortunately, as an 8 year old, she had both me and her mom by her side to give her the encouragement she needed to be able to learn how to handle failure. She would learn to breathe and repeat to herself ""mistakes are okay"" but it's hard for a kid like her to get through it.

Failure takes practice. And whenever I taught this student and was tempted to lower my standards for her so she'd stop crying and feel less pain, I'd think about those Ivy League kids jumping off bridges.  These kids need to learn how to handle failure when they have a support system around them. I imagine her at 18 years old, alone and with no one to help her through those emotions. 

Every one of these kids has been surrounded by nothing but praise for their performance since practically the day they were born. Most people aren't mindful of how our k-12 system and how society in general perpetuates ""smart"" as an identity, rather than something you work towards and are constantly getting better at. 

I have another story of a 4(!) year old who said to me ""I'm no good at anything."" He was about 2 years ahead of his peer group, but his brother who was a year older (who I also taught) was also about 2 years ahead of his peer group, and the younger child was always comparing himself to his brother and was convinced he wasn't ""good enough.""

That's the only time I've ever seen self-esteem issues in a kid that young. Both he and his brother were absolute gems-- extremely empathic, sweet kids. The younger one was clearly the ""shadow"" child, though, and it's so painful to see children suffer like that. 

In some cases, like the 8 year old girl, it's a necessity to experience the pain in order to learn and grow (I have no idea what a person should do about the family dynamic of the 4 year old, I just added it because I'll never forget it and wanted to share). People are afraid of allowing children to experience healthy pain. They think all pain is bad. But it's all a part of the growth process.

We are losing a generation, I think, to a flawed k-12 education system. Not just on an academic level, but on a mental health level. 

I only graduated high school in 2009. I know several people who went to Ivies after graduating as valedictorian. Not a single one of them had a 4.0 (or whatever the weighted version of a 4.0 is that high schools use). At the end of my freshman year of high school I ranked #1, and I myself had a B+ on my transcript, and that was after only a single year of high school. 

Now I hear of schools that graduate *several* valedictorians, *all* with 4.0's. Meanwhile, honors students are entering college at a remedial level. Maybe this had already been going on in 2009 and I just went to a stronger school than most (I know my school was better than average, but I'm not sure to what extent). I also have heard that many schools don't rank their students any more. 

I started out high school hoping for the valedictorian spot. I think I graduated in the bottom half of my class (shit happens). But that's life. It's how I knew I'd survive when similar stuff happened in college. You fail. You cry. Then you move on and put it behind you. 

I'd hate for someone to go through what I went through (more failure than I'd like to admit). But at this point I think it's *worse* to have had nothing but A's throughout life. I very much see myself in those kids, because had I not had to deal with the life shit I had to deal with, I'd have hit failure at an older age and not had the emotional capacity to deal with it. The lesson I learned from all that failure is that I could fail every class on the face of the planet and still be the same person. I didn't believe that when I was 16, and the vast majority of r/college doesn't believe it, which is maybe why I hang out there (I try to knock some sense into them). But I believe it now. 

The ""gifted kid identity crisis"" is a serious problem that's not talked about (although there is a subreddit devoted to it-- r/aftergifted). ""Snowflakes"" or not, suicide is a serious problem, as is high potential students dropping out and underperforming because they can't handle failure.",1,2020-12-09 17:33:06
gf6hrqi,t1_gf51zb3,True,ChemMJW,t2_gzakt,"&gt;If the judgement is not foolproof and it can't be by design (the prof doesn't know the student inside out), why then should they say anything at all about the student not being cut out for the field. 

Because all decisions made by any human anywhere are based on imperfect information.  The lack of perfect accuracy or perfect knowledge of a situation does not in any way imply that a judgment cannot or should not be made. In general, an expert's opinion (the professor's) is clearly to be trusted far more than a novice's (the student's).  That's the whole point of experience.  As I clearly wrote in my original comment, experience doesn't mean the judgment is always right, but if you had to guess as to whose opinion was more likely to be correct, the professor's or the student's, it's clear whose opinion you should accept every time.

&gt;It's up to the student to decide whether they are fit for a field, regardless of how many years it would take. It's their life, and they would be solely responsible for their decisions

Of course it is.  So what?  The fact that the ultimate decision lies with the student doesn't in any way preclude the giving of informed opinions.  The student is free to accept or reject those opinions as the student sees fit.  The ultimate responsibility for the decision *and its consequences* lies with the student.

&gt;IMO it isn't acceptable for a prof to give out judgements like this to students, even if they're thinking that they're going to do the students a favour, or doing it for the benefit of the student. 

Of course you're entitled to whatever opinion you want.  But experienced faculty have a different opinion based on our interactions with many thousands of students over a career.

&gt;Things like this can have very severe impacts on the mental health of students and the prof doesn't know what the student's background is or what the student might be struggling with in their personal life.

Academic and professional standards don't vary based on a student's private affairs.  Faculty are not social workers, financial advisors, spiritual advisors, psychological counselors, or surrogate parents.  Our responsibility is to teach content X and then evaluate whether a student has learned it.  If learning is more difficult for a student because of difficulties in the student's private life, that's completely understandable.  The correct thing to do is for the student to put off further studies until the student's private affairs are in order, not to charge ahead while underperforming and then act astonished when told that this level of performance won't cut it in the field.

&gt;It's the student's own life and career, they get to decide what they should or shouldn't do.

Once again, of course it is.  But that has nothing whatsoever to do with the ability (and in the case of faculty, obligation) to give a student honest counsel.",0,2020-12-09 16:23:00

gf51zb3,t1_gf3vgai,True,etal_etal,t2_3h7ric9z,"&gt;So, professors are faced with a very tough judgement call, perhaps one that you haven't fully appreciated: do I be honest in telling a student that I see success in a certain field as unlikely based on the student's cumulative performance, or do I allow the student to move forward while struggling and run the risk of the student investing another chunk of years before the student realizes on his or her own that this just isn't going to work? Now, is a professor's judgment always foolproof? Of course not. 

If the judgement is not foolproof and it can't be by design (the prof doesn't know the student inside out), why then should they say anything at all about the student not being cut out for the field. Sure, they'll think that they're doing the student a favour, but I do not think that it's their place to do such a ""favour"". Criticism should always be in the form of - ""Hey I think currently you're not doing such and such, so you need to do X and Y to make sure you have a chance to be successful in this field"". That's it. This is the best thing a prof can do for a student. It's up to the student to decide whether they are fit for a field, regardless of how many years it would take. It's their life, and they would be solely responsible for their decisions. The profs shouldn't interfere saying leave field Z based on what they think is best for the student.

&gt;If you think about it from our point of view, it's a no-win situation: some students end up bitter and angry that a professor didn't have faith in them, and some students end up angry that their professors allowed them to struggle onward for so long before pointing out the obvious. 

The student can blame the prof saying - I wish you'd have told me earlier. But they'd be wrong, since the profs would absolve themselves of any blame once they tried everything they could do support the student. On the other hand, if the prof steps in with claims of the student being sub-par/not cut out, they're negatively impacting the students chances of success. They would be to blame in that scenario if a student says that they could have been successful if the prof hadn't stepped in and said they're not good enough. The prof can be correctly blamed in that situation. 

IMO it isn't acceptable for a prof to give out judgements like this to students, even if they're thinking that they're going to do the students a favour, or doing it for the benefit of the student. The profs don't get to decide that and it will vary from prof to prof anyway, so why dish out a judgement when it's subjective in the first place? Things like this can have very severe impacts on the mental health of students and the prof doesn't know what the student's background is or what the student might be struggling with in their personal life. It is very condescending to think that the prof knows better about what the student should or should not do with their life. It's the student's own life and career, they get to decide what they should or shouldn't do.",2,2020-12-09 05:23:30

It could be that your professor evaluates students based on how well they learn alone because these students are easier for him, he doesn’t want to be bothered. 

It’s good to listen to criticism and take a good look at your self and stuff but it is also important to realize when people treat you like garbage. Don’t internalize mistreatment because it will eventually take a tool on your mental health.",1,2020-12-09 04:57:37
gf34ru4,t3_k8zo6h,True,MeikoD,t2_a68mb,"Having been in a very similar situation, I can understand your pain. Its bullshit and it's unsustainable. A career in academia is unsustainable for the sheer majority of us. You need to recognize that despite all the hoo-ha a postdoc is still just a job. We're told its not just a job, that everything you do in it benefits your future and so working longer and harder is just for your own benefit. In real terms however, that's bullshit, its a job that we are contracted to work 40 hrs per week and are paid relatively poorly at that. Your boss can have unrealistic expectations, but in the end you only legally owe them 40 hrs per week. 

It sounds like you've already know that this can't continue on as it is. It sounds like your priorities lie elsewhere and thats perfectly fine. Live the life you want, not to someone else's expectations. It doesn't matter if your PI is disappointed in you. Aren't you disappointed in them for being a bad mentor? When did their expectations of you, start to matter more than your own expectations for yourself? I went through the same thing and recognized my priorities were focussed on a healthy balance and that continuing in academia wasn't for me. It sounds like this might be similar to how you're feeling currently. At that point I realized my PI had less of a hold over me, if I wasn't continuing in academia I needed their approval less - at worst they might give me a bad reference to industry but I could also choose not to use them as a reference. Revel in this revelation - your PIs expectations of you have nowhere as much hold over you. In industry only your skillset matters and its not like your PI can erase your skillset.  

Once I realized this, the question became why am I still doing this? Why haven't I left already? What purpose does my post-doc serve if I don't plan to continue on in academia? Does that purpose equate to a difference of 60K a year in salary? The answer for me was that I needed a paper as a sweetener for companies to hire me given the extra hurdle of them needing to support my work visa. So based on that I came up with an exit plan. Mine became publishing a paper and getting out ASAP. My goal became doing what was needed to get that paper, but also accepting I wasn't going to kill myself for it. I largely stopped working weekends and 12 hr days. It required a re-framing of my approach, I worked my ass off for those 40 hrs I was contracted to work, but I didn't feel I owed my boss more than that. If I worked overtime it was to serve my goal of getting my paper out ASAP, not to serve my PI. It was to benefit me, not someone else. As a result I felt I had more control over my life and my mood lightened. 

Develop an exit plan. Can you leave straight away or do you want to publish. Recognize if your plan is to leave in the short term that you're going to need to carve time out for yourself - both for your mental health- and literally time to work on making job application. You can't do that if you're working til midnight every night! You'll get through this time! Take back control of your life!",1,2020-12-08 19:51:20

You don't have to navigate this really challenging time on your own, and there are people out there who have all kind of tools that could help you.

I have no idea how this works in the UK, but if possible, please take some leave.  If you can't do this, establish some firm boundaries for yourself.  Schedule out your day, stick to it, and don't answer work emails after hours.  If you need to, put tasks likes grocery shopping and meal prep into your schedule and treat those tasks as just as important as your lab work.  How do you organize your work tasks?  Do you write them down or keep them all in your head?  If you're doing the latter, I highly recommend writing them down as it will be one less thing your brain is trying manage.

Few things are ever as hopeless as we fear. The good thing about life is that it changes.

Firstly, you absolutely need to be seeking treatment for the underlying dissociative episodes, ideally before starting grad school but certainly ASAP now that they are negatively impacting you work to the point where other people are noticing. On that front, it would be appropriate to tell your PI in the meeting that there are ""underlying mental health issues"" and that you are actively in treatment for. Don't just lie and say this; actually do it.

But then you should quickly segue and focus the meeting with your PI on devising a plan for how to prevent, catch, and quickly remedy any mistakes you cause from now until you stop causing them so often. E.g., workflow changes, supervision needs, scheduling issues, etc. Ideally you would come into this meeting with ideas and your PI may have some additional ones.

While the underlying causes you're trying to mitigate against are more serious/severe than normal, it is absolutely normal for a boss and a new employee to work together on building habits and processes to help the student succeed.

Of course the individual should make the final decision, I said that originally  -to consider your circumstances and get proper advice.

&gt;However the mental health is significantly lower too rn, especially from the burnout and having breaks removed. 

 I have news for you - in grown up world I have to work for more than 14 weeks without a break all  the time. Like for 20 years. Competitive programs expect you to be able to do that. Many of these specifically ask about such things on the recommendation forms.

&gt;“It won’t bring it down to make a difference” is very subjective

2 semesters of 4 -3 credit classes with all A-s is a 4.0.  With one B- is a 3.84.  That is not subjective, that is math.

Anyone at a competitive engineering job is not going to think that the P =  a decent grade regardless of the GPA.

There is no world in which the GPA is the only factor, unless you are under the minimum requirement for application, in which case this b- is not the problem  because the having the minimum GPA  for application is not going to be , on its own , competitive either.






In competitive programs there are going to be plenty of people who did not take the P and still got good grades.

I am betting if there were forced P/F and not opt in, that people are going to be asking for actual letter grade documentation at some point.

I also didn't say it was fair.  You asked what I thought would happen.  I think in competitive programs the P is going to look bad, because there will be plenty of applicants who did not take the P and I won't have to choose you.

ge060rs,t3_k34ete,True,EnthusiasticHamster,t2_18r8pk,"Right, lots of stuff to break down and this isn't going to be an answer but a list of ideas and my thoughts. 

Firstly, don't worry about the stigma of quiting a PhD program. As you've seen already, industry won't hold it against you and your friends/family will understand. So if you aren't quitting due to the stigma, don't worry about it. 

However, I'm an optimist at heart and I think there's a range of things to be done to help you out. 

Firstly, do your supervisors/Uni know how bad it is? I don't mean this to infer you're an idiot but some supervisors will filter out your personal issues when you tell them or downplay them. My old supervisor, I would have to tell him quite bluntly when I wasn't ok. He honestly cared and was nice but I needed to tell him directly when i needed help, otherwise he would think I was telling him just to keep him informed. Both my undergrad and PhD uni's provide additional support, both for mental health and for studies. By telling them, you can set the machine into action for help. And with mental health stigma in academia, most of us are like swans. Graceful and elegant on top of the water and frantically kicking underneath, good for you to acknowledge this. 

It sounds like you work best with SMART objectives (it's an acronym of essentially, small, progressive, achievable targets) and that's the way most of us work. There needs to be a balance of the stuff led by your supervisor and yourself. PhDs are meant to be independent research but that's not realistic in 1st yr and I don't know many who can say that in 2nd yr. My big objective (I'm now a postdoc but that's just more paperwork, significant less thesis) is to develop a new catalyst for a big industry purpose. my objectives on friday where take a reaction off, fix the glovebox, ask the tech's for more acetone, have (socially distanced) lunch with a friend, have a meeting, continue to learn python. Though I didn't do all of these things (damn glovebox) it feels good to tick off each of these things. And each thing steadily furthers my research or my health. It's not possible to answer your thesis question in a day so just chip away at it. My objectives for tomorrow include, put a reaction on, do some analysis, fix the glovebox, go to group meeting. 

Personally I think you need to be a bit of an arse if you want to keep you on your PhD programme. You need to stick up for yourself and drag each into a meeting to make them realise your position. Many supervisors will just trust you to be ok. So before you quit, please tell them. Drag them, kicking and screaming into a Zoom meeting room and tell them precisely how bad it is. 

Finally COVID, COVID has put a lot of stress on the system and on personel and Uni's have delegated their responsibilities to specific departments. Some Uni's are handling it better than overs but I'm glad you've found a Job which is safe. For PhD, you should already have had a meeting about the predicted impact to your work and how to navigate that. you should also be able to change that stratergy when you need to. If you feel physically unsafe due to the working environment, you need to tell your supervisor and/or health and safety team (typically at Uni this is building specific).

I believe it is an issue with setting priorities and boundaries stemming from a distorted perception of self-value in a highly competitive unsupportive work environment. As academics, I noticed we tend to prioritize our work over our mental health and this is probably because we place our value and identify on our achievements in academia. We also find it extremely hard to set boundaries for the same reason. What happens then is what happened with you, me and I am sure unfortunately many others, issues with mental health, chronic exhaustion and burn out especially when the work environment does not care about your mental health as much as getting work done and having their  reputation enhanced. As humans, our health and well-being should always be our main priority. However, it is unfortunate that academics never discuss that till they get these health issues and reflect then. Even if you hear stories, you never think it will happen to you. Some get them while doing their master, some while doing their phd and many others get them after, like you. But, it eventually happens. We have to raise awareness of this issue in our field and prevent it from happening to others.

It is great that you have access to therapy and working on your health. I think this is the most important step to take. Working on your identity, life purpose and value will bring a new life outlook. I do think that the current work environment is contributing to your health issues, but are not the main cause. The tendencies we have in the structure of our personalities can be taken advantage of in other work environments as well, probably not as much as academia does. Awareness here is key, as placing importance in health and what truly brings happiness to you in the field (ex. curiosity fulfillment) as well as finding your value in other aspects of your life should be what matter here. Also, it is important to learn how to set boundaries and when to say no and take a break when needed.

I'm in Australia so I think we have something similar re the act. I have asked for support at work a number of times but have been pushed back/told to just get on with it. So that hasn't been supported.

I do like the idea of reflecting/journalling. I do that when I have an anxiety spiral but I haven't been doing it when there are down days etc.

gds54z6,t3_k1x6jv,True,Ned_Gutters,t2_efa41,"I wonder: what do you think does matter? It might be current circumstances, it might be false association (are you really trading health for work, or do they just correlate?), but it might really be that you sincerely do not feel your work matters. Some questions, then, are why doesn't it matter? Can it matter? What does matter? It might be the case that you can take a turn and research something that does matter. Or, alternatively, maybe what you think matters is just not a candidate for you to research.  
  
Another question is the kind of mattering. I'd like to propose inherent vs. Instrumental value. In this case, the question is, even if the research doesn't matter in itself, what does it do for you and for your life?  
  
Leaving Academia can be hard, and people need to be brave to do it. It's the right choice for people. But I think asking about what matters to you and in what ways is a good place to start.  
  
And to answer your question: I often feel this way. A turn in my research might work, but maybe I just need to get out and do something practical with my interests (in my case, mental health advocacy and support seems appropriate).",1,2020-11-27 17:18:06

The key difference with industry in our case is that you don’t carry the weight of whether the work is “worth it” (whatever that means). It is natural to second-guess yourself, and to fall into the trap of familiarity breeding contempt. After several years of constant exposure, it’s inevitable that the ideas you were excited about seem mundane. 

The way I have coped with this is to periodically review my ideas and projects and ask myself if this the most impactful and interesting thing I can work on. The time and place for all things pass: is that the case for the things I started several years ago?

It hard to evaluate this yourself sometimes, and from what you write you might not be in the best emotional place to do so. Find a trusted colleague (anywhere) with whom to do a thorough review: explain your current project, where you see them going, what you ultimately hope to achieve and how you will get there. Make new plans. Work on important things. 

It also sounds like you are having some mental health challenges. These are real: deal with them. Take a break, get your life priorities straight, listen to your therapist (or change them if it’s not working for you).",1,2020-11-27 14:43:47

gddlma6,t3_jzibk9,True,Cowboy_Yankee,t2_tp6yncq,"For your situation, I would advise you to be tactful about how you bring this situation up with your committee. I am not sure how you will be affected if things don't go accordingly, so be careful. Professors talk and I know this from experience,e so the idea here is to do what is best for you, which is to get your degree with as few obstacles as possible. If the committee brings up mental health or your interaction with the supervisory team during the meeting, you should indicate your concerns in a polite and non-confrontational manner. If there is a specific person on your committee with whom you have a better rapport, I would suggest you seek them out and speak to them one on one and see if they have some idea. Often advisors and professors find it easier to talk to in no-pressure situations as they don't want to speak negatively of one of their colleagues in front of other colleagues.

There was a Professor in our department who used to cut the hourly wage of his international Ph.D. students (he knew they won't retaliate like American or PR) if the work was not up to his expectations or if the students made mistakes such as grading errors etc. However, his students started speaking to other students, and over 2 years the word had reached other Professors and the department head, and ultimately this Professor was ultimately fired.

**​ Here is my story**

I got into my Ph.D. field due to various personal reasons that outweighed my academic interests in pursuing a Ph.D. Additionally, my master's advisor pursued and encouraged me to do the Ph.D., and I believed in my personal academic abilities.

My Advisor is nice and friendly, however, he lets me do my own thing which is not something I am very fond of. There is no structure or boss-employee dynamic. I receive little to no mentorship or advice, which makes most of my work completely based on my limited knowledge. To make things worse my advisor is also not very familiar with my area of research so I do not get that advice or guidance that you might get from an experienced mentor. And this area of research is something my advisor is deeply interested in getting into, so it is not something I brought up or dragged him into.

I was frustrated with this aspect and I became aware that my work was substandard by attending conferences and seminars in my area. I realized the ability to grow in my field with my current advisor is limited. I further realized this while doing an internship in my area of research this fall.

And for better or worse the COVID-19 situation has put most of our grants on hold and my funding is ending next semester. All this motivated me to give my prelims in November and I might end up graduating between May-August 2021. So it would mean I would complete my Ph.D. in less than 3 years. I sincerely wanted to stay and do more work at my advisor's lab but I am not sure how feasible that will be.

At this point I am assuming, the best-case scenario will be if I can get a full-time job or postdoc. I was expecting to grow and become better in my field during my Ph.D. but unfortunately, that did not happen and I feel I grew very little since receiving my master's.  I can't legitimately pursue academia with the few papers I have, so a postdoc might be good but I am sure the hiring folks will be skeptical about my Ph.D. too. So ya not an ideal situation all in all. Thanks for reading the ramble.",1,2020-11-23 22:24:50

gd8k4l4,t3_jywyrm,True,littleirishpixie,t2_x3ghy,"Yep. Did my Masters as a Mom whose husband was overseas for 1/2 of it, got a divorce at the beginning of my PhD program and did the rest of my PhD as a single Mom. It's hard but doable. My tips:  


1. First of all, whatever deadlines your professor lists, your personal deadline is 2 days earlier to prepare for whatever crisis might occur like sick kids or trips to the ER when your kid decides to jump off the top of the monkey bars. No crisis? Great! Then you have another chance to proofread your work. This saved my ass quite a few times. I utilize reminders in my phone/calendar and I don't even list the real date. I didn't want to know. I would check it if a crisis came up to see how much more time I had but otherwise, it didn't exist. 
2. Set a schedule and make it clear to your family that these are your work times. Barring crises (like the ones listed above), your family recognizes these as off-limits. They don't make plans during these times and should assume that they are on duty for the family responsibility. It's a lot easier on them if it's consistent. After my divorce, this involved grandparents stepping in to give me that study time. 
3. Self-grace. Sometimes the house won't be as clean as you want and that's fine. Sometimes dinner will be take out and it is what it is. If you are a meal planner and can freeze things, cool. If not, forgive yourself and watch your waistline. (I was a size 6 when I started my PhD program and left as a size 12. I gained 50 lbs during those 4 years that I'm still working to take it off...  it's going, but not nearly as fast as I would like it to!). Hopefully your partner respects how much you can do and is holding up their end too. Just be honest and upfront about what you can do and stick to that. If you have to get creative with solutions, do it (I hired a maid to come clean once every other week at one point). These things are okay. You don't have to carry the weight of the world. 
4. Learn how to say no to good things. Like the Mom friends who make you feel guilty for not doing playdates/Mom nights or volunteering. If you choose school, school and family are your focus, period. If you choose to do those extra things, it should be for your relaxation and mental health, not to appease people. People who don't understand and respect your ""no""  lose the privilege of being in your life. It's harsh but you do get a good sense of who respects your boundaries and who doesn't. 
5. Find a group of friends in your program who ""get it."" Your family won't. They may be supportive but they can't possibly understand what it looks like for you. Having your people is about the best thing I can say for your mental health. 
6. Learn how to break down work into smaller pieces so that you can utilize times when you would be sitting around doing nothing. Example: I used to meticulously outline my papers in advance so then when I had 20 minutes of downtime, I could focus on just one paragraph and take that off my plate (and believe me, these add up to having a mostly-done paper that just needs some editing). Or I could bang out one discussion post. Focus is a little harder (and I have ADHD so believe me when I say this) but if you already pre-plan it, it doesn't require a lot of deep thinking to prove what you already decided should be included in advance. And of course, revise it later. I wrote my entire dissertation at my kid's lacrosse practices. I think this was the biggest change I made. In undergrad, I wrote all of my papers in 5 hour marathons. In graduate school, I did most of my work in small chunks. I never realized how much time I was wasting ""waiting"" for things like standing beside the stove bored while I was waiting for the spaghetti to cook, sitting in a waiting room, sitting in the school pickup line, etc. I realized that if I added those up, it gave me hours and hours of extra work time. 

People who don't respect your decision can get over it. My former in laws spent every family gathering telling me how selfish I was for being in school and working in general because I guess it's my job as a woman to let my life revolve around my husband. We obviously weren't going to see eye to eye on basically anything. (And these people all have pretty miserable marriages so I wasn't heartbroken that they didn't think we were matching their standards). It took me maybe a year of that to politely say ""I'm glad that's working for you all. That's not what we chose. Now moving on..... (insert subject change here)"" 

Sidenote: I sort of hate your headline here because why on earth don't we ask fathers the same thing? (I'm not critiquing or judging you for your wording. It is what it is. But it makes me sad to rarely see men ask these questions and we as a society rarely expect them to.)",16,2020-11-22 17:30:18
gd8e2z4,t3_jyybko,True,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"First of all, it sounds like you are feeling a lot of distress right now. While finishing up a dissertation is known for being challenging in general, we are in the middle of a pandemic, and it sounds like longstanding mental health challenges or imposter syndrome feelings may be contributing to your feeling of being overwhelmed, as well.

On a very practical level, here are some tips that I have:

1. Communicate and be transparent with your advisor, if you have not already done so. Hopefully, as an advisor, they have a sense of how far along you are in your writing. But if they don't, let them know where you're at and what you're struggling with, and work together to develop a game plan for moving forward. Helping you across the finish line with this challenging process is quite literally part of their job as an advisor.

2. There's a piece I've turned to myself and recommended for students regarding writers block called Shitty First Drafts: https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf. At this point in time, focus on just getting any words on paper. Pay no attention to how good your writing is and spend no time editing this initial draft as you write it; there will be an opportunity to make revisions later. First drafts of something as big as a dissertation will always benefit from substantial revisions. But by just getting words down, you've accomplished what can be the hardest part: you have *something* that can be submitted, and then you can focus your efforts on improving it with the remaining time you have, rather than wondering if you'll be able to write anything at all.

3. Chunk your writing. Sitting down to decide ""how am I going to write this 25,000 word behemoth"" sounds overwhelming. Select a small portion of your dissertation you feel most confident about and start there. Decide on other chunks that are small portions of your dissertation you can write a first draft of in a reasonable amount of time (e.g., a few hours, or a day).

4. How much time do you have left? For example, if you need to submit your dissertation by the end of the fall semester, that's quite soon. But if you defend sometime in the spring semester, you both have a lot of work left to do but also some time to do it. Getting organized now and communicating with your advisor will help. I'll also add that it's okay to extend your program if you feel like you need to--we're in the middle of an ongoing crisis that affects people's ability to get work done, and it's okay if you find that you need more time.

Your advisor and your program likely want to see you succeed (and if they don't, they're shitty). I want to see you succeed. I know that you do, too, and you're struggling to feel hope. So I want to emphasize that if you've gotten this far, you can do this. Good luck as you write everything up!",2,2020-11-22 16:44:19

But I'm also happy to hear that you've identified a new direction you want to move in that will be more fulfilling for you. Other helpful responses have already been posted, so I just wanted to address two specific points:

**1)** I understand your relationship with your advisor is complex, and I agree that their behavior towards your peer was transphobic (whether intentional or not). Nevertheless, you haven't described any confrontations or instances of manipulation/abuse in your own relationship with her. All you've said is that she hasn't shown interest in your mental health.

While I do think faculty should have deep empathy for their students and remember that they exist outside of the classroom/lab, we're not mental health professionals. It's important that certain boundaries be maintained, and this is one of them. It definitely sounds like she's too far in the wrong direction! But it also doesn't sound like she's actively judging you for expressing your change in directions. **So, I strongly encourage you to ask for a recommendation.** She won't offer, because that simply isn't how this particular social contract works. Most of us are happy to write for students, because we want the best for them, **but we're never going to offer to assign ourselves more work.**

*This is a professional relationship between two adults.* If you want a letter, you request one, and then she'll provide it. Don't let your anxiety drive your decision-making. It sounds like you're either **A)** trying to displace the discomfort of asking onto her and **B)** expecting her to read your mind. If she's not deeply involved in your professional/personal life and you don't ask for a recommendation, she could easily assume that you cultivated a relationship with some other faculty member you thought was more appropriate to ask.

**2) You should not, under any circumstance, ""be open about my failed professional relationship with my advisor.""** First, it will only make you look unprofessional. Second, there's no way for us to verify what you say (and while we may know your colleague, we don't you). Third, it is irrelevant to why you want to make this professional change.

The point of a statement of purpose/research statement is to explain, using concise language and specific examples, what you want to achieve, how you're going to achieve it, why you want to achieve it, why this is the right program/department, etc. ***You should never use precious real estate to discuss anything other than yourself,*** your goals, your project, your strengths, your weaknesses, your capacity for growth, your resilience, etc. You could potentially **briefly** mention your friend, since their death is clearly part of the impetus for change here.

But my experience was shitty. I had my first real bipolar episode. This was before my 2nd year of graduate school and the university therapist suggested that I take a year of absence. I was told that I could leave but I wouldn’t recieve funding so I literally couldn’t afford to do it. 

Coincidentally, my thesis advisor was abusive. I was already in a bad place while trying to control a stew of meds. I was told to take leave in December but I didn’t. And by february my bipolar disorder grew into full blown psychosis, suicide attempt, and PTSD. At that point, I didn’t have a choice to take the leave...I was being forced out. Once I was in the hospital, I took an incomplete for my courses. I knew I would not be able return for August term or receive funding for it so I mastered out in hopes of using the degree to find a job. But after everything that had happened, I didn’t mind leaving. I was already considering and I even managed to get a few PhD apps in.

But then COVID turned the world upside down. I left the hospital as they couldn’t hold me as originally planned. But I still had almost daily virtual appointments. And when I retuned home, I was lucky enough to get a few accommodations and extensions from the university and department. So while I was still (virtually) hospitalized, I got a new thesis committee and finished my original thesis in a month. I also managed to get my incomplete courses turned into completes. I formally received my Master’s at the end of this past summer term and have been adjuncting since then. It was the hardest thing I ever done and I still don’t think I recovered.

I was accepted, by some miracle, into a new PhD program. I deferred for a year and have instead been adjuncting while getting used to medication and recovering. My university ended up sending a formal apology letter about my thesis advisor. But in all honesty, none of that would have happened if I were able to take the leave of absence the first time it was mentioned. I just couldn’t afford it. 

And when I was forced to take the leave, it was extremely difficult to even focus on my mental health because my leave still became work. 

I dont know if this is the answer you are looking for but the hardest part may actually be funding. 

Administrative wise, everyone was extremely patient. Doctor’s notes helped. I would say that the leave would be great if you have money! But lol, please don’t let it get as bad as I did.",1,2020-11-18 03:21:31
gclqp0q,t3_jvraaz,True,MegMeganNutmeg,t2_8mf955rh,"Didnt read the whole thing, but here's my perspective:
You cant just ride out a burnout. As someone who tried this through a postdoc I can confirm it just gets worse. It's unfair to you, but even mor unfair to the lab. My burnout transitioned into breakdown. We have this awful culture of ignoring the health of students and postdocs. Indeed, we tend to push people to just be tougher and imply that people who need help or a break just cant cut it in academia. This is utter bullshit. No one can just work 24/7 without a break. Recognizing that you need some time is important, doing something about it is even more so. No project or job is worth sacrificing your health. Mental health is health.


Its not fair to just quit. You need to talk to your advisor about how you are feeling. You could find a conpromise (part time?), or they may ask you to stick around and help find someone who can take over for a while. You took on a responsibility, you cant just abandon it, but if you are really burnt out, you need to take care of yourself.

gcfymvf,t3_juvnh5,True,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"First of all, I want to acknowledge that what you're describing sounds quite distressing. I can see that feeling this infatuation without having an outlet to talk about it is weighing on you, which makes sense given how deep your feeling is.

My advice to you is to:

1. Seek out counseling. It is a safe place to talk about your infatuation, develop skills for managing your feelings here, and ideally work to develop skills for healthier relationships. You describe feelings of extreme distress (crying for hours, mania) and it would be beneficial to have professional support with these feelings, too. Your college should have a student counseling center that you can turn to.

2. I would recommend avoiding this professor to the fullest extent possible. Given where you are at right now, having a clear and unambiguous boundary would likely be helpful. Don't take anymore classes with him. Don't find some reason to go to him for office hours. Etc. I imagine that having a clear line will help you to do what is best for your own well-being, and will help you to avoid false hope into some sort of relationship that will never be.

3. Despite all of the firm words here, I do hope that you can be kind to yourself. We don't choose who we feel attracted to, and the fact that you feel attracted to this professor is not your fault nor something inherently bad. We choose our behaviors, and unless I've missed something, you have not acted inappropriately. Of course, the behavior that you fantasize about is one that would not be appropriate to pursue, and you're spending a lot of time and mental energy thinking about it. It makes sense to work hard, ideally with a mental health professional, to change the way you interact with this attraction: to find ways to manage what sound like intrusive and repetitive thoughts and a high degree of distress that relate to this attraction. But again, I hope that you can be kind to yourself. I hope, for your sake, that you can move forward and find opportunities to develop attractions to people closer in age and similar in power to yourself, both to have hope at a relationship that has a realistic chance of happening, and ideally, to experience the joys that can come with that.",15,2020-11-16 00:18:39

It's not a binary thing, when I have encountered these situations in other PIs and asked, ""I heard from your student that you asked them to work on weekends, what's up?"", they say ""actually they took 4 weeks offs to go skiing, while knowing they had a proposal deadline already on the calendar, and I was suggesting that if they want to make that deadline they would probably need to work the weekends until that deadline.

I bring all this up to say that while I am aware of how absurdly competitive academic fields and related jobs are, and how inadvisable it is for even people going into school 8+ years before I would be even if I went in a few months, I also don't really have anything else to pursue. I'm in the US, i'd be paying for undergraduate courses and would likely need to take out a loan no matter what, and there's not any other fields or careeers I have an interest in. I also have various mental health and more importantal physical disabilities, so even if I were to want to go into a trade or manual labor or something, I'm not sure I could.

Would you realistically say I have anything to lose by going for it?

It's also worth noting here I suppose that I don't actually have an interest in being a professor or teaching, and I guess I see acadamia more a means to an end then anything else: I just want to meaingfully contribute to the field in terms of research, have contacts and connections with researchers for the sake of my own knowledge, and especially further public knowledge and apperciation and access.

Make a template for yourself that you can copypaste into emails with minimal changes.

I had a motto that I followed throughout grad school, and it was ""no zero days"". What this meant to me was to do _something_ every workday to move my project forward. It could literally just be one small thing, but if it was at least one thing then I considered the day a success.

Second, rockyfaceprof is definitely correct that you need to talk to somebody in the administration, most likely mental health councilors first. Admins often aren’t skilled at handling ED, since they’re scared of the legal repercussions to the school should your health really take a dive. But if you have to talk to admin directly, bring an advocate you trust with you—a parent, a therapist, or a friend who can help you discuss your needs and keep you from being pressured to do something you don’t want to. Also, know that you may not need to share absolutely everything—just that your mental and physical health requires a break, and that you’re willing to provide more documentation if necessary. It depends on what your school requires

Finally, it’s valid to be scared this could derail your degree.

Most of the time you’ll be able to, but sometimes you will have to work until 11pm. So if that’s the case then you take a morning off, or leave early the next day, or something to get a bit of balance back.

But also, if you’re in a stem field, frequently your experiments may control your time, especially if you work with animals and/or cells. I do lots of rodent behavior so sometimes I have to come in at night to fast them or do postops or respond to sick animal calls that are in experiments. So if I know I need to come back in tonight for a while, I’ll head out early. I used to feel bad for not being there 8-5 every day. But I learned it literally does not matter (tho to some PIs it does if they are micromanagey but I actively stay away from those kinds). In general it matters about your experiments and results rather than your work hours. You are training to be a professional, and your PI likely trusts (or will teach) that you understand what is needed by X deadline. You will learn how to plan experiments accordingly, and I learned it’s sooo impt to factor in time for things to break/fail/pandemic. 

I just defended my MS mid pandemic and started my PhD a couple of months ago so any thoughts of regular work hours went out the window. When I was getting ready to defend it sucked, straight up. But I made sure to sleep when needed even if that meant 4am-noon bc I was writing until 3am or hadn’t slept for 2 days or something. You do what you need to. I would go in and image at midnight bc no one was around, machines were open, and I didn’t have to risk exposure to people. I was also SUPER burned out so after my defense took time to do ZERO work, sleep in, and hang out with my family ☺️

Also rmr that many people in grad school have families with kids so they also are among those working when needed at times. Some can’t come in until X to drop kid off at school, have to leave by Y to pick them up. Again, you do what you need to. 

Last couple things - I found weekend meal prepping and having things to reheat every week day has saved my mental and physical health. Also, getting a dog saved me even more!! They have to eat and get walked and play and stuff and hey, so do you, so this actively encourages you to take care of both of you. Time for pups breakfast? Cool same.

gjgnwsu,t3_kyi1wj,True,illmaticrabbit,t2_lafs7,"My take is that the work/life balance problems of PhD students and STEM academics in general mostly stem from the narrow way that scientists are evaluated. In general, “high-impact” publications and grants (which you’re more likely to get if you have publications in top journals) are the keys to job security and success. 

But getting published in top journals is not a fair game. You have to have consistent positive results and there is a level of flat-out luck involved. Papers in top journals require a huge amount of data and usually they are worked on by 10+ members of a large lab (but only 1 or maybe 2 people will get the first author position). Sometimes you have to spend time setting up equipment or troubleshooting things- activities which you can’t write about in a paper and thus people joining labs that have already established in-demand methods have a big advantage. There is also a bias towards certain (often expensive) methods that you may or may not be able to use in your research. The list goes on.

All in all, the top journals are run by for-profit companies and their goal is to make money off of subscriptions to their journals. They publish the sexiest papers and they don’t care how their decisions affect scientists’ careers. To be fair they never asked to be the arbiters of academic success.

I think PhD students recognize the need to publish and get grants, so they push for high-impact publications by significantly upping the amount of time they put into their work. Working harder increases one’s chances of success for sure, but probably by only a modest amount in my opinion, and can be counterproductive if it tanks your mental/physical/social health.

I think anyone considering a PhD should know that academia is far from the ideal meritocracy it would like to be. You need to have a backup plan because it’s possible you won’t be dealt the right cards to be able to secure yourself a stable academic job down the line. You also need to separate your self-esteem from your academic success to a large degree, because academic failures (and successes) are often more situational than the result of your personal efforts.",0,2021-01-16 14:39:04

giw2vi7,t3_kumo8i,True,small_clay_jug,t2_9cmk58ri,"Honestly this post sort of made me a little sick to my stomach remembering my undergrad years, having gone to a school exactly like the one you're describing. Implying that Trader Joes and Whole Foods are the absolute basic necessities is the kind of ingrained classism that made me remember professors snidely interacting with the ""yokel"" student population. You don't have to absolutely love living there, but you have to realize everyone else living in that town is doing it somehow. 

Most of the time these small towns have a general store in that town or in the next town over. It's not Trader Joes, but most of the time you can actually find the best regional food stocked there. Much of the time they'll even have super local produce. The general store in my hometown sells milk from a farm a few miles away, maple syrup and honey from a farm the next town over, etc. You might have luck if your college town has a little food co-op, which is what stores like Trader Joes are built after. It's honestly a little disappointing you're limiting yourself to franchise stores, some of the coolest things I've found have been in tiny country stores. I grew up in a much more rural place than you're describing, and the way my family handled getting stuff from stores in larger amounts was pick one day of the week and make it an afternoon trip. 

If you have any friends in the college, why not build your own foodie activities. Start making recipes you've been dying to try out, and invite your friends. Have them make something, like a potluck. More than that, they're going to have some insight into where the best food in the region is. You can start making recipes with the local produce-- I guarantee food coming shortly from the source tastes very different than out of Trader Joes. You're not into the outdoors, but I've found my mental health improving drastically once I started taking short daily walks, and I anticipate your mood about this whole situation would improve with a little familiar routine. 

The other thing about small towns is that they usually have something going on in the town library, or the rec hall, or something similar. During the summer my tiny town has a craft fair, another town eight miles over has a cheese festival, and there's countless other places with something similar. You can often pick up excellent quality local food and crafts for a fraction of the price what stores in the city would sell them for.

If you absolutely miss the city, book a room in a hotel for the weekend and make a mini vacation of it. We academics often have three or four day weekends scattered throughout the year.

Finally, while I recognize small town life isn't everyone's cup of tea, there's a lot small towns can in fact offer. I would really encourage you to allow yourself to explore a totally different culture, it might give you something surprising. Most of it is totally word of mouth, you're not often going to find it marked on Google Maps.

(FWIW, I also am a postdoc researcher, also in my early 30s and single, who regularly makes trips back to my tiny hometown when I can to stock up on the local food and other goods I can't find in the city.)",0,2021-01-11 15:34:17

If you are drawn to teaching, you might consider a DSW. Many institutions that emphasize teaching over research are more and more open to DSW degrees. If you would like more flexibility with where you end up as faculty, a PhD might be a better fit, although there is a focus on research.

Your work background will absolutely help you be a better candidate for admission into a PhD program and eventually, a faculty position. Social work programs like to see work experience so that you can teach from your practice experience. More and more programs that hire social work faculty are looking for some specialized practice too--mental health, AODA, corrections, etc.

Most tenure track positions I've seen are 9 month contracts, with June, July, and most of August off. I spend my summers writing and teaching a summer class.

And you call others naive yet believe that there are moral concepts that every single person in the world would agree with?? Your genocide example is humorous given the fact that some leaders (such as the Khomeini) have called for exactly this.

You seem to be operating under the impression that there are objective moral truths, and there could be, I don't know, but I'd be interested to take a look at the foundation for your own moral beliefs---that you imply as universal. And further, your evidence that they are indeed objective. At this point your dogma is approaching religious fervor. 

I also find it baffling that someone can sit here and criticize the merits of free speech in a democratic society, without even hinting at the disastrous consequences that censorship has wrought historically. Tell me, historically has it been free speech that has been the bane of liberal societies or has it been censorship? When evaluating the transition from a closed society into an open society, do we generally see free speech taking form or more censorship? 

Authoritarians love the reification fallacy. They are all about ""the common good"" and the ""good of society,"" they're the protectors of the abstract. Your ""absolute moral truth"" is no different than the Saudi's, and they like you are willing to censor any and all information contrary to the status quo to protect the ""good of society.""

Spreading lies about the Coronavirus online is dangerous and shouldn't be tolerated? What about sharing anti-vaxxer news? Should all anti-vaxxers be censored? What about spreading creationist information online ? Isn't that dangerous too? What about teaching eternal damnation to children? Don't studies show that it's inimical to their mental health? Should we censor them?

A professor is batshit crazy for being a trump supporter and spreading coronavirus lies and should be silenced/censored as a result? What about a professor that believes we originated from two humans named Adam and Eve, that a man who sacrificed himself for humanity will return and that there will be a fiery apocalypse in the near future wherein all those that lacked his belief would then experience eternal hellfire? Should this person not be allowed to disseminate such ideas on his personal twitter account?

I mean where does it stop. And who's moral authority are we operating from? Anything and everything can be censored in the name of ""civil society"" or the ""common good."" That is why it's best to err on the side of free speech than on the side of censorship.",0,2021-01-08 23:30:48

No one has suggested that OP go into detail about their medical history; that's a strawman. The issue is whether OP will face negative consequences for broaching the subjects of sexual assault or mental illness. 

If someone was in a car wreck and said, ""Yeah, I was in an accident and was in traction for 6 months"", it would not be considered TMI or ""unprofessional"". But saying ""I was the victim of sexual assault and was in therapy for PTSD"" is considered ""unprofessional"". What does that say about the definition of ""professionalism""?

Here are some of the (well-intentioned and pragmatic) comments on this thread:

&gt;No. Way, way too much information. Don't mention specific diagnoses  
&gt;  
&gt;If you are asked, speak in broad terms. Saying ""I experienced some health concerns that caused a delay in my studies, and I am healthy and doing better now"" is sufficient.   
&gt;  
&gt;From the perspective of an employer, *even a very sympathetic one*, someone with a mental illness is a risk... On top of that, most people consider mental illness and trauma to be TMI  
&gt;  
&gt;Just say health issues. You could be setting yourself up for discrimination or even just making an interview awkward with too much information  
&gt;  
&gt;You should just cite resolved health issues, yeah. The less information the better, and the less chance that it could hurt you. 

The two themes that I see in these comments are:  
1) The subjects of sexual assault and mental illness make people ""uncomfortable"" and should never be discussed at work, unlike similar issues.  
2) Those issues must be ""resolved"" for someone to be fit for a job, whether academia, government, or private sector.

So, what do these people do in the mean time? Accumulate more gaps on their CV, which will put them at an even greater disadvantage? Why can't the people *who don't even have to live with these issues* have compassion and realize that people with disabilities can contribute if they have necessary accommodations?

ghosq2x,t3_ko1urt,True,EpicDestroyer52,t2_1uh0xdx,"Hi, here are my answers as a Sociology PhD Candidate

&amp;#x200B;

1. You get to research whatever you want since everything is connected to society. Live your best life. Programs still exist that fund students pretty well, pay for health insurance, and the highest ranked programs place okayish (pre-covid). Doing your own work for 6 years can be very fun. If you net a job with a good (2/2 or 2/3 in soc) teaching load, sufficient research support, and tenure you may be set for life in a stimulating intellectual environment where you get to continue to study whatever you want. If you find joy mentoring and working with students there will be opportunities or requirements to do that as well.
2. When you get to do whatever you want, you can get lost. You might think the niche you discovered is interesting and be disappointed with the realities on the job market. You might become discouraged that policy-makers etc. don't listen to sociologists that much. Your friends and family might think your work is not useful or not understandable as a real job. A lot of sociology PhD programs fund students poorly or require them to do a lot of teaching. Even if you really like teaching, if someone tells you teaching a 2/2 while trying to complete your PhD/build your skills/navigate the job market/publish papers/discover your own academic trajectory isn't difficult: they are lying. You might find that the unstructured time poses challenges to your mental health. After getting your PhD if you want to be an academic you will have little control over where you live, which can make building a community and having a partner or family more difficult. You may have to do a series of poorly paid and temporary positions in the hope that you will be the 1/100 who lands the dream job. You might be wrong and not realize it until you get to the end.
3. The academic job market blows, it blows even more in Covid-era. Positions pre-covid regularly got hundreds of applications per position. The glut of candidates means people are adjuncting and taking jobs they are grossly 'overqualified' for (I know everyone has different perceptions of what jobs are the best so I put that in quotes). Getting a masters degree in sociology is usually a bad idea imho. You often have to pay for them and they don't uniquely qualify you for anything. Having a masters or phd in a social science could make you more compelling to a gov't data job or the rare non-profit that has money to burn I suppose - but having a sociology one in particular is often not more valuable than any other social science. And there are very often more efficient ways of getting those positions than spending \~6 years on average in a doctoral program (even if it is well-funded). I would generally say you should only get a PhD in sociology if the job you want requires a PhD in sociology - usually means you want to be a sociology professor.
4. Well, I would say plenty of academics are introverts. But even in grad school you will have to present at conferences, seminars, lab meetings and TA/teach students, sometimes in large numbers in intro/stats/methods if you're at a more populous institution esp. I'd say that liking to talk to others is helpful, since it makes networking more fun but plenty of my colleagues and friends loathe the experience entirely and they've done fine. And it surely isn't to the level of being 'on' as a true service profession.
5. Huge amount of burnout. People burnout of grad school and leave, people burnout on the job market (or can never get the type of job they are hoping for and have to make the decision to walk away), people burnout after becoming professors and leave. The thing that makes academia prime for burnout is that nothing ends. You published a paper? Write the next one. You taught 4 classes this semester? Prep the next 4. You won a big grant? Better start writing the next one. Of course people enact or try to enact healthy work life balance and limits for themselves. Some are very successful, some struggle since it's not easy to slough off the pressure of the profession to put in 70 hour work weeks.

My advice, aim for academia, apply to postdocs if you’re committed to academia, but start getting experience for non academic jobs now. Also maintain your mental health somehow. 

Unfortunately it is not common to get to your 6th year with no publications. It’ll be difficult to get a tenure track job with no pubs (at least in the social sciences and natural/hard sciences). Sometimes it’s the advisors fault for not preparing the student and sometimes it’s the students. Hard to tell from what you shared, but having a bad advisor is common.

I know that I probably would have had more publications and be more successful if I was healthy but I've managed to do well despite everything and get a permenant positon in which my field had only a handful of jobs posted this year. 

One thing that is challenging is I don't take days off. I know that sounds insane and isn't great for mental health but I save up any days off in case I am really sick and can't function. I have to work ahead on everything because my condition is unpredictable. I also tend to work a big chunk in the morning and I work best at night so academic allows me to be flexible in works hours. I doubt I could handle a 9-5 job.I don't have children and I am single so this schedule does work for me. I'm not sure what field you are in but historians generally work alone. We don't have labs so I can't speak to how to manage that. 

One thing I had to get accommodations for during my PhD was to write my exams laying down on a couch. I contacted disibility services and arranged this. I recommend you doing this if you can.

There is a alot of small things I do as well. I just invested in a gamer office chair that reclines and has a footrest.

Feel free to msg me if you have any questions. It's a challenge but I am doing it and somehow I've never cancelled a class from illness. 

I start teaching 4 courses next week and I am a bit scared. It's the most courses I've taught at once and one  new prep.

A humanities PhD puts you into a pretty challenging job market. This may be a good time to assess whether the goal of a PhD is worth it to you or the MA has already set you up for success. Dropping out of a PhD when that is done with intention and/or in order to pursue a preferable alternative option is not any kind of failure - it's wisdom.

The stressors of the PhD were accumulating after getting 2 years into a 3 year program. Part of my project brought me to Australia, already very far from my support network, I got worse, and then the bushfires started and I just couldn't cope anymore. Told my supervisor I needed to get out and sort things out. Everyone ended up being very supportive.

Once back home, I immediately started the process for therapy, rest, and healing. I didn't know what was ""wrong"" with me yet, but I was using the time to give myself the space to find out. I intentionally kept my social life to a minimum, I didn't want to be running around stressing myself out further, distracting myself from why I took a break. Then the pandemic shut downs began and I really had time to get into my shit. I found a longer term care plan to address my mental health, and when I was finally no longer in a critical phase, I decided to return to my project. Largely because of the support i received over requesting accommodation to support my return. 

Honestly the stress of academia is not something I think I will ever be able to tolerate, unless I can make real progress in my mental state. I probably wouldn't have gone back to the position if I wouldn't have then risked my residency status in this country. I am almost done now,  basically just need a defense date, so thank fuck for that.

ggifm4g,t1_ggifl8t,True,DevilRay-BlueJay,t2_8q208dl6,"On a more personal note, one thing people have to understand is that, for example, among new grad students (and not just women) many will have experienced sexual assault in undergrad or childhood. And if you're real lucky, (/s) you've experienced both. And often times, when those assaults occurred, they were \*not\* well received when reported, and that has very serious implications for one's education or career and mental health. So imagine that you are a grad student in that position, and while in grad school another grad student reports a professor for sending sexually explicit texts to them. The investigation happens, and the report is now public record. The department leaders, meanwhile, don't inform the grad students, lab techs, or postdocs of this, so it's up to some faculty and students who \*do\* know to inform others of the report. And in the report, not only do you find the details of this incident, but a substantial amount of evidence that this a repeated pattern of behavior for this prof, and that other profs were aware of this. The profs who knew are also interviewed in the investigative report, and some express outright disrespectful views that dismiss reporting rules, dismiss the severity of his repeated actions, and belittle the victims in question for being weak and causing trouble. And after all is said and done, the prof isn't fired and the department leadership still does almost nothing to inform or protect students, lab techs, and postdocs. So, as an observing grad student who already has personal experiences of being sexually harassed and assaulted and afterwards vilified and disbelieved, and now you see the same thing happen to another grad student in a situation where there is even physical proof and multiple eyewitness accounts of many of the prof's actions...do you think this is a system in which you'd feel great about reporting? Do you think this would create a professional, welcoming environment? This is a situation I've experienced first-hand, and I personally know others in a related department at my university as well as in the same field but at a different university who've experienced a similar situation.

7. I have discussed some examples of what could be considered sexual harassment and sexism. You can feel how you feel about whether these experiences ""should"" be bearable, but the fact is that many studies have shown that these kind of things, in addition to other forms of discrimination such as racism and ableism, do have negative effects on undergrads, grad students, and professional researchers in academia &amp; industry. And that those negative psychological effects can impact the student or researcher's career trajectory.

I also don't appreciate it when people bring up the frequency of sexual misconduct in other workplaces. I'm not saying that it's what \*you're\* necessarily saying here specifically, but it's something I've definitely heard from other male profs. I dislike it because it 1) insinuates that I've never worked another job when I have, 2) implies that I'm unaware of the prevalence of sexual misconduct which is extremely far from the truth, and 3) feels like an excuse not to care about sexual misconduct or do anything to prevent it. I'd also add that one of the big things I feel is somewhat different in STEM jobs (&amp; other academic jobs and probably many business or legal jobs) vs. some other work environments is the intimacy of  the workplace. Departments usually are fairly small; most people work excessively so you are interacting with the small group very frequently; conferences, receptions, and invited talks often involve traveling with others, sometimes overnight, and there's often pressure to drink alcohol at certain events &amp; be around lots of intoxicated people; you're pressured to be in constant correspondence with coworkers and collaborators via email, phone, video calling, etc. even when not at the workplace; mentoring is very close and intimate; because specific research topic circles are often so small, individuals with power can have a significant impact on not just your current job, but your ability to conduct meaningful research in that topic field again; etc. The other work environments I've experienced, and those my parents have experienced, are much more get in, get work done, get out, without the constant socialization with coworkers or intimacy of work relationships. That cuts down the number of opportunities for sexual misconduct to occur, but by no means eliminates them.

8. As far as the diversity committee goes, I'd first argue that this isn't something that is driven only by members of the committee. I'm not sure what the situation at your university is that, but this year mine and several others I've heard of have really ramped up their diversity talk. My university as a whole now has a diversity team as do other departments within the university. And as universities become increasingly diverse as the demographics of the U.S. change, I'd imagine they'll increasingly want to come off as inclusive and welcoming. So, universities and departments now \*want\* students, postdocs, and faculty to engage in diversity committees. But in my department, ours is almost exclusively women, and the few men involved are almost all of color, disabled, from another country, or gay. And this is overall unsurprising - studies have shown that members of the groups D&amp;I initiatives are targeted at are disproportionately engaged in D&amp;I work. That's because we really want the culture to change because it really isn't  working for us. 

And I'd also warn that in addition to universities and departments wanting to come off as inclusive by having D&amp;I committees, there are people outside the university who care about this as well. Our department is dealing with a large number of more recent alumni refusing to do promotional work for the department or recommend the department to prospective grad students &amp; postdocs. And I can think of two other departments who, in the past ten years or so, had some backlash from alumni, donors, and the community after a sexual harassment scandal went public. So, to sum it up, I am engaged in D&amp;I work because 1) the university and department wants it to happen, 2) I personally would benefit greatly from making things more inclusive for female, queer, and disabled members, 3) because of my experiences I care deeply about making the experience more supportive for other kinds of diverse groups such as scientists of color and trans scientists, and 4) there are real ramifications to having a noninclusive department in these changing times. I believe, therefore, that D&amp;I work \*is\* very valuable, and it shouldn't be on the people who need change to happen the most to do all the work.

2. ""If I get caught, will they do anything to me?"" -- Also very unlikely. They'll probably figure you just screwed up.
3. ""If they decide to do anything to me, do I have plausible deniability?"" -- I would figure yes, you screwed up. Or maybe the sample got tampered with, who knows.

ggdn39g,t3_kgabbq,True,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"It is a value of mine that a college or university should be invested in supporting every student and having every student be able to graduate. Students struggle for a variety of reasons: the material is challenging, lack of study skills, challenges with work-life balance, physical or mental health challenges, having to work 20 or 30 or 40 hours per week to pay for school or support family members, having family issues, and more. For students who are from underrepresented backgrounds at their university (e.g., students of color at a predominantly white institution, women in majors that have predominantly men, etc.), biases such as racism and sexism, among many others, play a role in their experience.

A college cannot eliminate every one of these struggles (though there are things they can do for some of them), and I do not believe in watering down the rigor of courses (though professors should also know what is an appropriate level of rigor in context). At the same time, it's important to recognize that a system that fails to support all students will, in effect, privilege students who come from the most well-represented backgrounds and circumstances.

I'll add that an environment in which only a small subset of students will be able to graduate will lead to immense anxiety and a lack of collegiality as students see their classmates not as friends or collaborators, but as competition. It would do this without any discernable benefit. By all means, if a student does not know the material, etc., they should not pass their classes. But that should be a rare outcome that we work hard to prevent (while recognizing that the student, ultimately, has to have the knowledge and do the work) rather than something that's built into the system.",1,2020-12-19 17:23:36

&gt;What about your role in ensuring the well-being of students' mental health?

I think it's totally appropriate to ask students if they are doing okay if you are concerned and also to help get students connected to resources. While the university counseling center is by far the easiest option (because we have on-call/drop-in services, in non-COVID times I could even physically walk them to a therapist and do a warm handoff if they are currently in crisis), I am happy to walk students through the process of seeking alternative help if they request it because I have expertise in this area and because this content is directly relevant to the course content that I teach. However, I think a professor/instructor would be doing their full due diligence by referring a student to their counseling center's referral services if they did not want to seek therapy within the Counseling Center (someone who can get students connected to mental health resources outside of the counseling center). It's not a professor/instructor's job to be intimately knowledgeable about how to make appropriate mental health referrals and I think for most professors or instructors, doing so would be pretty clearly outside of their scope of competence. 

I also want to note that while I *am* an undergraduate instructor and I *am* a therapist, I am not a therapist to any of my students. I am happy to pass students along to appropriate resources and I am relatively forgiving about due dates and crises.

In many ways I have not been able to relax since I started my PhD, which was in 2010 (I finished in 2016). The pressures will in many ways get worse as you approach the more difficult aspects of academic life, like comprehensive exams, dissertation, defense, and the job market (if you are aiming for academia).

I say this not to discourage you, but rather to urge you to find strategies that work now, so that you don't become overwhelmed. Substance abuse and other mental health issues can be quite common and quite debilitating among academics. So can things like stress eating. Now is the time to figure out how to keep yourself on an even keel. If you do not already exercise regularly I cannot recommend enough that you do. Yoga, the elliptical, weights, just going on a nice long walk at a brisk pace--whatever it is, you should be active. It will help with stress, help you sleep, and help keep you healthy. 

It will be helpful for you to find something you can do that signals to your brain that it is not work time. I personally cannot read fiction with any regularity now, ten years after starting my PhD. I'm not sure I ever will be able to again. What I can do is listen to podcasts and audiobooks, which are not the same as real reading but do help me relax while also engaging with ideas other than those for my job. I also play video games and watch TV with my spouse. This is not intellectual; we often watch quite dumb TV. You may prefer something different; that's fine. What you do need to try to do is train yourself to allow yourself these small moments at the end of the day in which you are not in work mode. Maybe you want to build models, or get into throwing pots, or volunteer.

Finally, if you are able to afford and otherwise access counseling services, you might do so. Anxiety can be a normal response to stress or it can be a sign of something clinically wrong that might be helped by medication.",8,2020-12-17 15:38:46

I prepped for my quals with two friends in my neuroscience cohort. We spent 8 hours a day together studying, and felt like we were on roughly even footing. The first time we took the exam, two people passed (me, friend A) and one person failed (friend B) but then passed on a retake. Now, five years later:

Me: postdoc, published many papers but none especially good, what I would call a very ""middle-class"" scientist looking to get off the academic track because I recognize I don't have the DRIVE TO PROFESS needed to pursue a TT position.

Friend A: dropped out of the program, couldn't get a masters due to program restrictions and undying hate for lab science, now happily married, working in science assessment, owns a house.

Friend B: postdoc @ NIH, fewer but higher-quality publications than I, rockstar network of both peers and mentors, concrete career path and plan.

All of us: 

* struggled with mental health issues (therapy, medications, NOW! Reach out to your school counseling center yesterday and be up-front about financial hardship), with the financial pressures of grad school, with family drama (for me, homophobic family; for friend A, living with boyfriend; for friend B, abusive mom).  

* had hard conversations with our PIs about the things we weren't good at (I didn't publish enough for my PI; Friend A didn't progress fast enough with data collection; Friend B didn't get along with everyone in the lab). 

* had multiple conversations about scaling back our project ambitions, because that is one of the most common conversations in grad school *period*. 

* along the way, felt crushed, burnt out, and like we should start careers elsewhere.

Nobody can tell you if you should leave. Nobody can tell you if your challenges are a sign of a bad fit (at the program level, at the lab level, at the should-I-even-PhD level...) or just of a really fucking hard time right now. But I can tell you  what you're going through sounds common, even if it's atrocious, and none of these signals necessarily have any bearing on your quality as a scientist *or* your eventual trajectory if you decide to stick with this PhD. I can also tell you that it sounds like you're burnt out, dealing with internalized family bullshit (which will not go away just because you masters out!), and need help.

With other students, we spent most of our time complaining about the PhD and talking about how hard it was. Even when we got onto other topics, we would gradually drift back to talking about either Our PhDs or The University. Yes, a PhD can be hard, and yes, those can be useful conversations, but that can't be your social life. If you spend a good chunk of your social time talking to other PhD students about how difficult PhDs are and hearing horror stories - many of which will be second or third hand and possibly exaggerated - then that is going to contribute negatively to how you feel about your PhD. It will potentially feel more all-encompassing, more overwhelming, and more difficult than it might otherwise be. 

Conversely, I also kept up an active social life with friends who weren't doing a PhD and had no interest in talking about my PhD or anyone else's beyond the usual chat between friends about how they're getting on in life. Those relationships were much better for my mental health and wellbeing, and gradually I stopped socialising with other students.

More generally, people I know who weren't close friends with their PhD colleagues seem to have had an easier time of it than people who were. Perhaps that's because people who were struggling felt the need to have more of a connection with other students - that's very possible - but I know that at least some of them also believe that it was because they had a non-academic social life. 

Anyway, I now tell PhD students to keep on good terms with their colleagues and to socialise with them if they want to, but to not feel obliged and to keep an active social life with non-students if at all possible.",5,2020-07-21 10:33:20

I hope that there are other people in your life--loved ones or close friends--who you can turn to for support through this, as well.

There is not really one right way to tell your PI about your mental health--it first and foremost depends upon what you feel comfortable sharing with him. There are pros and cons to sharing less or more--sometimes hearing a specific diagnosis such as PTSD helps a person to understand what is going on for you more clearly than describing your symptoms in broad terms, but with that diagnosis also comes stigma.

If I were in your PI's shoes, I would have a general idea that you are experiencing some mental health concerns and might not fully understand what is going on for you (which is okay! You are under no obligation to share the full details). If you want to, you might be a little more direct and specific: ""I want to follow up upon our previous conversation. I experienced a prolonged abusive situation about 2-3 years ago. I am in therapy and, through that process, coming to better understand the ways in which that is affecting me, such as my memory, ability to concentrate, etc., and ultimately a diagnosis of PTSD. I can assure you that I am doing the very best that I can right now, including sticking with therapy and medication. At the same time, I am experiencing some challenges right now with X and Y, and I wanted to help you to better understand those challenges.""

Again, it's up to you whether to be more specific in that kind of a way. Perhaps it helps your PI to better understand where you're coming from. There are also PIs who would respond in ways that are judgmental or perpetuate stigma about mental health challenges. You know your PI better than any of us do.

No one wants to talk about the crippling anxiety, feelings of worthlessness, and insomnia that comes from being a part of academia, because everyone wants to seem like they’re doing well and have it all together. I think grad students are the best at discussing this, but after you get out of school, no one wants to keep talking about it. For your students, sure, but for you and your colleagues? It’s instead joked about over beers. It’s no secret that the academic world can be incredibly toxic, but I feel like it’s avoided the higher you get through the ranks.",1,2020-07-04 04:21:47

My advice for a potential linguist specifically (I'm planning to submit my phd in sociophonetics in the next few months), is to spend as much time as possible upskilling for industry while you're there. The more programming/statistics/data science you learn, the more employable you're going to be both inside academia and outside it. My heart's in academia but I don't thin my mental health can deal with it long term (even assuming academia wants me in the first place, which is never a guarantee). But ling degrees, especially if you lean hard on the STEM aspects, give you a unique skillset that make you desirable in a lot of other areas. People I know that have graduated within the last 4-ish years have jobs in gov't, immigration, statistics, business analysis, national security, policy boards, and indeed postdocs and a TT or two.

fwlweqq,t3_hjd6lp,True,variablyinstrumental,t2_fz8on,"I had a lot of trouble with this in grad school (and still do).  The biggest shift in my thinking was to treat grad school more like a job.  Unless I had a big deadline looming, I tried not to do any research outside of time that I had designed to be ""on the clock.""  (This usually meant I did TA/RA-related tasks in the evenings, after I had come home from the department, but those never felt linked to my self-worth in the way that research did.)  If I felt exceedingly anxious/exhausted on a particular day, I tried to accept that this was my body's way of indicating I needed rest and that, if I forced myself to work on research, I would be both miserable and unproductive.  A lot of it came down to trusting in my work ethic -- it is unlikely one gets to grad school without a good one, after all -- and that I would get the work done, eventually.  Knowing when to step away is an important part of the research process.

On a more practical note, hobbies are really helpful.  I think this is especially true if they let your mind work in ways different than your research.  I'm in a very quantitative field, and I found a lot of release in running, playing piano, and reading fiction.

I do enjoy the flexibility, the fact that nobody is really checking on me on a daily basis but there is way more admin to sort out than I would like - I just never thought about what went behind the scenes I guess. I always thought, as a student, that teachers/profs would just get paid to speak to an audience and that was it. The amount of paperwork I have to produce is at times rather insane. Then, on top of this, there are all sorts of other good/bad dynamics that you will have to learn to deal with: student mental health, relationship with colleagues, department politics. It is really a multitasking career and you have to be ready to use your brain in various ways, which is not necessarily a bad thing.

The thing is, you didn't actually *apply* to over 30 places if you weren't applying directly to posted, funded jobs.  All you did was ask 30 places if they *happen* to have a job available at the moment.  The fact that they didn't is no big surprise:  if you have a funded grant and a need to get some work done, you don't just sit around on your money waiting for people to email you.  

The typical lab probably hires what, one postdoc per year?  And they'll have that job open for, let's say, a month?   So the odds of you happening to hit a lab that happens to have an unadvertised open position is maybe 10% at best.  But then, some places with funding will already have a candidate lined up.  Some places simply won't (or aren't permitted to) hire without advertising.  So that number is realistically probably a lot lower.

I suggest you focus on applying to actual advertised, funded postdoc jobs.  It'll be a far better use of your time and you'll be able to clearly target your application to their needs based on the job description.

But, if there are no other jobs in or out of academia on the table, I don't think you should put yourself in the precarious position of unemployment, especially now. Remember that you can leave whenever you want.

I'm a young professor who did my PhD at an Ivy and now work at a highly ranked R1. Some of my fellow junior colleagues approach their research and teaching with a lot of distorted cognitive/behavioral patterns. These include catastrophizing, negative self-talk, black and white thinking, etc. I know one person who convinced herself last year that she had to wake up 3am to do course prep (there was no logical reason). I have two friends who constantly insult their own work in casual conversation and struggle to acknowledge and celebrate their achievements.

**I don't do any of that. You don't have to either.**

Some of it is temperamental. It's not that I don't feel stress; it's just that I respond to stress by reminding myself that I'm competent enough to fix issues that are in my control and smart enough to let go of issues that aren't.

Some of it is nurture. I grew up really poor and was the first person in my family to attend college, so that helps keep things in perspective.

I love this job, but it doesn't define me, and it doesn't make me special. Universities want to convince us that being in academia is a gift, not ""just"" a job. That way, we'll willingly sacrifice our physical and mental well-being for the chance to adjunct at three different institutions and teach five classes without health insurance. I think students and faculty struggle most when they buy into this lie and tie their self-worth to academia.

You can take this job and perform it in many ways. You can kill yourself trying to become a ""rockstar."" **Or not.** I'm able to spend a lot of time on my hobbies, which include playing the piano and writing fiction. I give myself reasonable research expectations and generally meet them *because they are reasonable*. I assert clear boundaries with colleagues and students (for example, I don't check emails after 5pm/on the weekends).

I catch up with long-distance friends regularly. I'm living in my first nice apartment. I grab drinks with colleagues to celebrate birthdays, publications, and the last day of class. When I feel like it, I travel on breaks and during summers. Other than my two teaching days, I control my schedule. I always do what's most important to me first. Everyone else's needs/wants come second.

As long as you have clear boundaries around your work, it's great. Teaching is the hardest area to get under control, but it gets *a lot* easier after the first year. I do sympathize with packing up and moving to an unfamiliar town/city alone. That's been the hardest part for me. Most faculty, junior and senior, move with partners. (You might consider seeing a therapist to process the stress of the PhD and the possibility of transitioning to a faculty position.)

There's a good article entitled ""The Awesomest 7-Year Postdoc or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Tenure-Track Faculty Life"" that I think would provide some helpful framing.

However, she also contributes greatly to literature searches, as do the other undergraduates in our lab. If a student is writing as much as you are- they’re first author. Hard stop. That’s the ethical thing to do. 

The misconduct would come in as well if I made my undergrad mentee write the bulk of a paper going towards my dissertation. My dissertation will involve some data collection at sporting events, and my RA mentees will be assisting in that. That’s completely ethical. But all analyses and write ups, such as the discussion, should be my own. 

Our RAs are compensated by research credit. 1 credit = 3 hrs of work a week. Most take 2 credits so they work 6 hours. We NEVER require them to work more than that unless they ask “hey I need next week off so can I work a little more this week and a little more in two weeks?”. There are also weeks where there might be a little more work to be done- for example all the undergraduates present the project they’ve been working on to the undergraduate research symposium. The week the abstracts are due and the week the posters have to be printed tend to be more hour heavy (despite constant reminders sometimes they like to procrastinate)- we take this into consideration and make sure they have leeway in later weeks. So it sounds like you might also be taken advantage of here too. You’re not getting compensated at all, plus it sounds like you put hours upon hours of work in. 

I’m sorry your research experience is going this way. I hope you at least learned something about the research process (it sounds like you did!) and will get to see your name published before you graduate. I also hope you haven’t been turned off to research and that you find a more supportive (and ethical) environment.",1,2020-05-08 03:44:10

Are there other things you would need, like access to therapy? 

I will be completely honest that if a student told me they had bipolar II and recently began medication, I would be hesitant to bring them abroad, especially for a year-long period. That's not fair to you, but that would be my first reaction. I would be very worried about what would happen if the student lost access to or stopped taking medication, or got very unwell. These concerns would be amplified if medical care in the country was not accessible or did not treat mental health issues well. I would be worried about being responsible for your wellbeing, which is something I'm worried about with all students I travel with, but I would be extra concerned about you based on experiences I have had with childhood friends who have bipolar or bipolar II. 

I would do a lot of introspection on this: first, get as much information as you can -- without relying on your professor as the source of information -- about access to prescriptions and medical care. You can even consult your current doc and ask for their opinion, both on the access and on whether they recommend you travel for this long period. There should also be a travel office on campus that can give you some answers. second, really reflect on whether you feel like you're in a secure and stable place to make this move.",1,2020-05-07 13:16:45

Start with something like, ""I take a medication that I worry will be difficult for me to procure in \[destination country\]. Have you or anyone you've worked with had a similar situation when conducting research abroad?"" On the off chance he *does* need more information about the specifics for some reason, he can tell you as much.

I also highly doubt that your mentor is the *only* person who can help you with this. Your university's study abroad office, your psychiatrist, and even your country's embassy in the destination country are all likely to be helpful resources. You are certainly neither the first nor the last person to need to navigate issues of managing medications when going abroad for extended periods of time.

Also, I'm honestly sure there's out there on the internet that you just haven't found yet. Have you tried googling the names of your specific meds to find out whether they're restricted in your destination country (this will have a huge impact on how you need to proceed)? Are the meds a controlled substance in your home country (because if not, you can often get some sort of travel exemption to get several months' worth at once)? Have you tried googling how people of your citizenship generally get prescriptions for physical health issues filled in your destination country? Do they need to get re-diagnosed by a local doctor, or are evidence of their home prescriptions generally sufficient to get a new prescription issued locally? How do things like insurance and payment work? The answers to these questions are likely to be similar to those to your questions about prescriptions for mental health, but will be much more widely asked and answered online.

Now, all of that being said, from the perspective of a fellow MA student (so definitely take this with a grain of salt), I don't see any reason why you *couldn't* get specific with your mentor if you think the relationship you have with him would make it appropriate and comfortable for you to do so.

fpk0038,t3_gdws9m,True,late4dinner,t2_771bx,"In academia, rejection is one of the most common of experiences. It never goes away because we keep being evaluated (e.g., for publications, conferences, grants, programs). It always hurts more early on in this career, but it's important to develop an effective coping mindset. In my experience, a good strategy is to try viewing rejection as taking stake with how an idea, application, or whatever is currently seen. Maybe this means you need to communicate something in a different way, maybe it means you need to work on an aspect of your CV, maybe it means nothing and was just luck. There are so many factors that go into successful/unsuccessful outcomes in this type of occupation that viewing those outcomes through a self-centered lens is really problematic for our mental health.

fphypoo,t3_gdk90q,True,synthesis-synthesis,t2_3ev125pt,"Professor here. First, congratulations ! I'm glad that you have clarity about whether or not to pursue an academic career. To answer some of your questions:

""Should I feel guilty for not wanting to pursue these?"" **No.**

""Can I tell them (my past advisor) that I do not want to pursue them?"" **Only if you want to.** Since you already explained you don't want to go on the academic job market, they shouldn't be surprised.

""Can I request they stop asking me to work on this?"" **Yes.** It's somewhat surprising they've been hounding you if you already communicated your desire to leave academia.

Your advisor isn't the only person from your university who can provide a reference letter. I assume you had a larger dissertation **committee**. I also assume you took **coursework with other professors**. Make sure to keep those relationships in good shape, at least for the next year or two. As soon as you get a job, you'll start developing a new roster of people who can vouch for you.

You provided further context to Quant\_Liz\_Lemon when you wrote ""I think they’re adamant about getting the papers published because they are a co-author."" **This is not your problem.** This is especially true because they are **1)** *tenured*, **2)** in a different research area, and **3)** did not fund you (beyond a 60 day period).

Even if they funded you for a significant period of time, that doesn't obligate you to expand their research profile. *Your mental health and your boundaries are more important than their ego.* It's also very possible they think the work is valuable and their reasons are mostly altruistic--that still doesn't obligate you.

I'll also give them the benefit of the doubt since you haven't explicitly told them you're not going to publish.

When you write , express gratitude for their guidance over the years. Then tell them you're not going to pursue publication. Thank them again for their time and wish them well. **Don't JADE:** justify, argue, defend, or explain. That makes it seem like you're doing something you don't have the right to do or like you require their approval. **This is your intellectual labor, and you're no longer a student.**

Don't mention future job references in this particular email. No need to link that with the frustration they may (or may not) feel about your boundary setting. They may or may not respond. Just reach out in however many weeks or months to secure a reference. If you have any suspicion at all that this person would undermine you, then seek references from other faculty and staff.

foyg0e5,t3_gaagaz,True,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"Some thoughts:

1. Yes, by all means it's okay to link to YouTube videos. Sometimes, someone has spent a lot of time and production quality doing something you'd like to show, and often there is no need to reinvent the wheel. Make sure that YouTube videos you link to are at a level that is accessible for your students.

2. Think about the distinction you'd like to make between what you show yourself and what you want to link to. I teach classes about mental health and counseling, and when I use videos in-class or online, I often try to think about what kinds of videos can offer something I can't myself; for me, that is often videos where people with a mental health condition share their first-person experiences, or clips of therapy sessions. For you, that may be different; I'm not sure what STEM field you're in, but I could imagine things like chemical reactions, physics demonstrations, etc. being great to show in video format rather than conduct yourself. I typically don't use external videos as the only source of key course concepts; rather, I think of them as a way to build upon key concepts that I've highlighted and prompt discussion. I encourage you to think of what you'd like to provide in your own videos, and then think of how outside videos can build off of that to make your online class a richer learning experience.

3. All of what I just said is ideal, but it's also the middle of a pandemic, so do what feels realistic for you. But I will say that just because there are well-produced YouTube videos on a variety of topics in your field doesn't mean that students would prefer to watch an assortment of professionally produced videos from various YouTube channels. There is a value to continuity with a single person (that being you!) and explaining things not just in sleek professional videos, but in ways that build nicely on each other in the context of your class and feel accessible to your students. It's all about balance, and I encourage you to think intentionally about the mix of your own videos and external videos you'd like to include.",2,2020-04-29 14:50:51

GPA: 4.0

GRE: haven't taken it yet but am currently studying my ass off for it

Research experience: I've been on one team for 2 years and joined an additional one last year. The most recent team I am on is funded by the NIH and can be also counted as a NIH research internship. (2 years of research experience on 2 teams); presented 2 posters at an APA affiliated conference and at a school conference. \*\* the research is about mental health and developmental psych

Internship: worked at a refugee services center and helped develop a mentorship program.

Things that I hope to accomplish before I graduate (and can add on my resume):

possible publication, possible internship at a rape crisis center, mental health technician (for domestic violence), joining Psi Chi

I am also in a sorority and have done many fundraisers and have volunteered, but i don't know if that's relevant

I've always had an existential bend in my thinking so I was compelled by the relief I felt when consuming art and getting lost in those stories. That slowly led me to reflect on how my entire life is a story I constructed and how I participate in a storied world, full of things we have all chosen to view as ""reality.""

I'm interested in everything from the ""God gene"" and how it has manifested in people across space and time, and how their ecology influenced this. I'm interested in storied selves. I'm interested in using one singular word/theme and exploring how that concept manifests itself around the world (i.e. death, birth, time, etc...). But I don't know where to go from where I stand.

but the literature needs to be bulked up, there needs to be a deeper exploration of the brain, its emergent properties like culture and experience, and how it relates to the collective, to culture creation, how culture colors experiences. for example people who hear voices in the u. s. often hear more alarming or persecutory voices, some tie this to our culture having little formal space for voice hearers in society. in other cultures where voice hearing is accepted or admired, the voices are experienced as more helpful and more integrated into the self. 

psychology and the mental health industry (in the u. s.) is full of flawed post positivist research trying to prove to the health insurance companies psychic health is worthy of being reimbursed for. it leads to rigid schools of thought that dont account for socioeconomic context or cultural differences in experience. it leads to reinforcing the fucked up structures in the psychiatric industry that harm real people everyday. 

so. your work might actually be helpful in changing a portion of the Healthcare system. 

but you could also go in to medicine, public health, sociology. you could also go into a more anthro/tech direction and kinda work to develop the current next edge in thinking aboit reality and humanity. i think again, think strategically. you can become a cult academist with a ted talk and the book deal without getting a graduate credential. you could be extremely well read on the subject without a graduate credential. you probably cant carry out a large scale research project especially with govt funding without a credential or at least a close affiliation with someone who does. but things like participatory action research make things more accessible depending on what you're tryna do.

find journals and journal articles that get at what you want. dont just look in academic databases. there are collectives, zines, and artists who self publish critical work all over regarding similar things, and that work enters academia as well. follow the careers of folks of all ages you admire and the fields they contribute to. figure out your strength and pov.

It doesn't necessarily make you a *better* researcher, either - just a researcher with a different perspective and other strengths and weaknesses to bring to the work.

What can suck is the psychological toll, especially if you're doing research on the problems and challenges of your communities. I've conducted research on chronic illness, drug abuse, mental health, harassment and violence in disadvantaged populations. Sometimes, confronting how entrenched, systemic, and persistent your communities' problems are can get depressing on an existential level.

And it *absolutely does* change the way that you think and feel about your community. You'll have a deeper knowledge of the threats, challenges, opportunities and strengths in your community in a specific area than the vast majority of the world. Sometimes, that knowledge will absolutely frustrate you in a deep, deep way. (I have a PhD in a health sciences field. My mental health sucks right now.) Change isn't always a bad thing.

foc6kyw,t1_foc1ya2,True,aomines,t2_gl429,"Hi - so it is actually very common for mental health professionals to encourage their patients to google/talk about their disorders and things like that. My therapist did it with me when she gave me the diagnosis and told me to tell her what I thought about it the following week. While I learned a lot from her I also learned much of what I know about bipolar from other people online who have it, as well as medical websites and such.

I think my point is that things like terminology and ""real mental disorders"" aren't only decided by researchers. The people who are experiencing the struggle themselves are going to know their mind and body the best, even if they don't know the nitty gritty details that come with vigorous research. Telling someone their disorder doesn't exist is incredibly invalidating and could possibly trigger their condition to be much worse - especially for people with mental disorders as self-validation is a skill many of these people lack. I know at my worst, if someone told me I was faking it, it would have felt like the end of the world and I might have had another suicide attempt.

For an anecdotal case, I was misdiagnosed several times before I finally received the diagnosis of bipolar. Even trained professionals who have been at it for decades don't always know best for a patient.

My other point would be, I don't think the specific label matters too much. DID is one illness out of many that can be treated in similar ways. There are some disorders that benefit more from certain treatments (BPD with DBT for example) but in general, therapy and medication are typically tailored to an individual's needs anyway and a large amount of mental health treatment is trial and error. Also, when things are comorbid, when you treat one illness sometimes the others are more manageable.

In short: mental health is very subjective, and I think trusting the experiences of people who have disorders is important. There is no reason for a perfectly healthy individual to fake having a bunch of comorbid illnesses so regardless of the specific label, it is clear they must be struggling in some way and go to therapy.

EDIT: mental health care is also very expensive, especially in the US, so they might not have the resources available to them to get a proper diagnosis!",1,2020-04-23 18:48:22

&gt;Another reason is if it could affect my professional development, but it could also help round out the set of skills that I'm lacking in.

PhDs do not grant you much of a skillset over a master's degree other than in original research. If you don't intend to work as a researcher, it is typically not worth pursuing a PhD over simply having work experience in whatever you actually want to work on. I don't know what skills you are lacking in but unless it is related to research of some sort, it's probably not what you'll get from a PhD project.

&gt;there are still some thoughts I have that feel discouraging. For example, how long it would take me to complete my research and if I'm only doing it because I want to attend certain schools for the experience and to say I received a PhD from there.

As stated above, a PhD is not worth doing unless you have a firm grasp of what you want to do with it. It's a big time investment - not to mention that just having some sort of empty bragging right for having one is not sufficient motivation to carry you through the program.

&gt;Lately, I have been feeling burnt out and I saw that is something that is a reason majority won't pursue or drop out/""master"" out. Although, that could be because of the pandemic going on and not being able to do daily activities I was once able to do and being stuck inside trying to fixate most of my time studying vocabulary words.

If you felt burned out during your education before then that may be a concern but it depends on the root causes. If you are feeling burned out only very recently NOW in the current ongoing pandemic, I would not take that as much of a hint of anything, except to take good care of your mental health in these challenging times. PhD students are not gods and we also get stressed and frustrated by the current situation. Don't be too harsh on yourself when it comes to the current crisis and take care of yourself.

Finally, my general advice to you is more to make sure you know what you want to do with whatever path you pursue and to read up on the type of education that people in the jobs you eventually want to get have gone through.

I'll note, since you're prior to the start of your doctorate, that my personal opinion is that given the current academic job market,  someone should only pursue a PhD if one of the following is true for them:

1. They are absolutely sure they want to become a tenure track professor.

and/or

2. They have a (very) serious itch when it comes to inquiry, learning, and research in the field they're pursuing their doctorate in.

The latter was true for me, and I don't regret it for a moment. I absolutely loved getting my PhD. Barring some bumps in the road that are pretty standard, it holds as one of the most profound and personally meaningful things I've done in my life. I only mention the above criteria because without at least one of them (and, if the first is true for someone the second should be too), it's unlikely someone will complete their PhD. To my knowledge, the stats are that about 50% of those that pursue doctorates actually complete them. You don't make it through to completion unless you're quite dedicated to the goal - it has way less to do with intelligence than perseverance, combined with a lot of supportive conditions (and that's saying nothing of the stats, which are far lower, of those who earn the doctorate and then go on to get TT jobs).

All that said, I have great news for you! You're planning on studying in a field that has lots of great options outside of academia, and you also seem to have an orientation and interests that would make you a good candidate for a pretty wide range of jobs.

You've got good options as applied researcher or evaluator in a range of public, non-profit, philanthropic, or private sector organizations that are connected to (or even less connected to) your field of study. These could include:

**Public (federal/state/municipal)**  \- These might be social service or education agencies at various levels, and the nature of the job would look different depending on what level you're operating in. Cons here are that the pay usually isn't very good, and there's often quite a bit of bureaucracy (at best) and organizational dysfunction (at worst, but this is everywhere really). Upsides tend to be the possible impact - applied researchers working in settings like these often do work that has scale and reach, and can inform policies/practices that affect many people. I know lots of folks that do great work and have satisfying 'alt-ac' jobs in these settings.

**Non-profit** \- these could be community based mental health or education organizations, national organizations focused on research and advocacy, etc. The dynamics can be somewhat similar to the above, though much more variability on each of the three dimensions I noted (pay/ bureaucracy/scale), as those usually tend to track with size. A big difference here as that there also tend to be more options in this space to remain connected to the academic community and do things like publishing/sharing research, depending on the situation. This is especially true in non-profits that have a very specialized content focus (e.g., early childhood development research) and also think tank jobs, where researching, writing on, and, to some degree, advocating around specific areas of policy is the bread and butter of the work (and yes, there are jobs in think tanks that are not 'political', at least in the narrow sense of the word, for folks specialized in various applied social science disciplines).

**Philanthropic** \- these jobs are somewhat more few and far between than either of the above, but they're out there, especially if you're connected to a subfield that's ""hot"" in the philanthropic community (early childhood is one in your general area, as is social and emotional learning). In my experience, research positions in foundations tend to do a mix of evaluation work and strategy work, depending on the size of the foundation and its orientation towards the research community more broadly. Definitely better pay, and variable on bureaucracy and impact, depending on how much money they give out.

**Industry** \- there are certainly jobs in industry for those involved in psychology, though I know much less about this space and where folks from psych go in terms of industry. My sense is that some of these tend to be more in the realm of either industrial/organizational psychology. There are also many people that are former academics and don't continue their disciplinary focus, but bring their methodological skills to that table. I have numerous former grad student friends who were in psych and education who went into the tech sector to work in data science positions, as UX/UI researchers (both qual and quant positions), or even just in general organizational strategy positions. Obviously better on pay, same in terms of variability on bureaucracy, and almost always less oriented towards pro-social impacts.

The one down side of all of these, in terms of what you shared, is that doing things like teaching and mentoring grad students is not part of the job. Teaching is always possible at local universities (though, \*very\* poorly paid, on a per course basis), and it's possible to maintain jobs in the areas I mentioned and also teach - employers often like it as it bolsters the credibility of their research staff. But mentoring students in the broader sense is out - that's reserved for those in the TT. It does happen in teaching individual courses - I've done so and really enjoyed helping students think about their research areas and dissertations - but not the same as the 'full' version that TT faculty get to engage in.

All's to say that there are plenty of options out there (and, by the numbers of jobs available, more than in the TT academic world, TBH), so you've got many pathways outside of the academy.

By all means, reach out to your professors. Let them know that you're planning to apply for graduate school and that you'd like to chat to get some guidance and advice. You can preface this all with the fact that you know that this is a difficult time for them and completely understand if they are not able.

The age of psychologists as master clinicians who can diagnose and treat complex mental disorders is done. Increasingly public and private health agencies are replacing us with social workers and masters level therapists who may have a single year of clinical training. The average psychologist has 7 years of graduate school, an MSW can be completed in one full year. Psychiatrists don't respect assessment and don't realize how little they know, ms providers don't respect research, and our market share is consistently eroded. 

Roughly 20% or less of applicants get into a psychology PhD. More than half of med school applicants are accepted to one medical school. 95% of med students graduate, compared to about 80% of PhD. Psychiatrists spend 4 years in formal graduate didactic schooling, psychologists spend 6-7. And yet psychiatrists are the default leaders of teams despite the fact that they aren't as acquainted with the research, aren't qualified to do assessment, and half the time don't know what they are looking at.

Here is what you should do. Take the easy path. Go to some random DO school, become a psychiatrist, and live on easy street forever.

A given psych PhD accepts about 5-8% of applicants. Harvard law accepts almost 20%. There is almost nothing harder in the world than this, and nobody around you will recognize or understand this.

ON the the other hand, learning can be marvelous and I believe it to be one of the only very few sources (  and i mean ""you can count them with one hand"" amount) for finding meaning in life as along with love 

Learning and personal development are one of the only things that give you that sense of progress, like if you unlocked a new ability in a game or a new tool. That in turn leads to wanting more, to see the ramifications of what you learned, and the causes of it.

So yeah, I would say it is pretty addicting.

Hummmm what do you actually enjoy? video games? movies? music?

Try thinking what you enjoy about it. This often (if not everytime) leads to some academic or artistic discipline.

If that alone does not make you feel like picking up that discipline, you could further think about how taking part in any community, say for example being a gamer, you can be someone that purely consumes games and adds nothing to the community, which although completely fine still puts you on the more passive side, and creating games and content related to them furthers cements your position in your community and might something that appeals to you.

If none of these produce even a slight bit of interest nor motivation, I would maybe just think about mental health more for the time being, trying to study enough to get acceptable grades to maintain a situation where both you and your parents are satisfied, and maybe just try to ""enjoy life"" by trying different arts (films, music, cuisine).",1,2020-04-13 05:15:37

That said, I also agree with everyone else that's posted. The stress and expectations of a PhD program are 100% too much for June 1 and you need time to grieve. Perhaps there are other options, like starting in September? Would it be possible to move in with a supportive friend rather than your parents and see how you feel?

What if it way you, and somehow afterlife existed so you could still wish things. Would you wish your lover got stuck in grieving you and live a terrible life? I bet not.  Life moves on, everything heals, and what remains is a healthy dose of missing your loved one.  A healthy dose of grief. Focus on good memories, try to smile when you remember her, and keep in mind that she'd always want to see you happy and at peace.

I was 22 when I lost my dad, it was right at the beginning of my 4th semester of my BA.  All of a sudden, lung cancer.  This stuff works differently for everyone, but I found myself just going to school after the day of his burial.  Not really a conscious decision, more like my gut dictated me that I needed some fresh air, some ""moving things"" in my life. In retrospect, I did have episodes of grief and of just not knowing what I was doing, but I believe it also helped me not go down a spiral of bad mental health.

So if you listen to yourself and feel like your PhD might help you cope with things and you can focus on stuff in the coming weeks, maybe pushing on through could be beneficial to you. But if you feel that it'd be detrimental both to you and to your education/career, and/or you feel you need to stop and grieve her, to hell with everything else, take the opportunity to the deferment. In doing my MA I'm learning that people who didn't do these stuff are completely ignorant how much emotional labour and stress is involved in this thing, so I'd only take advice of my colleagues and supervisors.

The truth is there´s increasingly more competition in academia and there are some people that work around the clock and some supervisors that would expect you to do that. Working all day everyday doesn´t necessarily mean that your work would be better. I´ve seen plenty of grad students go to the lab every weekend and stay 12 hours everyday. They weren´t always the most succesfull and they ended up burned out. 

I´ve seen people who were succesfull in terms of career but they were always crying in the halls because of all the stress.

I used to be in the same situation. I had a toxic PhD supervisor who, after losing interest in my topic, did not care about my project anymore (not even read my dissertation). She postponed to review my manuscript until the last minute and I had to cancel my defense. I graduated eventually, with only one publication and mental health issue.

Unlike you, I've never asked for help since I thought it was my fault and now I really regret it. A few years have passed and I still feel like shit. I was an honor undergrad student but, hey, look at my PhD. It could be better than this.

Last year I got a job, however, my team started a collaboration with my PhD supervisor (she is very well-known in my field). It's not publicly outing her, but I opened up to my team about how manipulative she is and how she treats me and other students. During the project, my PhD supervisor was upset with me and just lied to my boss that I never showed up at her lab (I was there every day we have cctv). I was called by the committee. Some doubted me. My boss didn't believe her but she just said that she didn't care about my relationship with my PhD supervisor or how she is, she cares about the work output.

Remember that a PhD does not define you. We are taught to believe this in academia, our social lives, every waking hour are focused on this goal. But there are countless stories of people leaving academia and finding much much happier lives. Hierarchical institutions are inherently abusive, and I am always checking in on myself if this is something that is worth enduring. Can you see yourself without a PhD? Would you be a happier person?

Do you have any other professional mentors that you can confide in? Perhaps they will be able to offer advice specific to your situation.

If you are set on getting a PhD, is it possible to switch advisors? It sounds like you are nearing the end of your PhD and I understand that it will not be pleasant to effectively restart your PhD. But perhaps with the skills you've learned you can find a better advisor and do your phd very fast. PhDs in the EU are already much shorter than the US or canada. And finding an advisor that isnt' abusive will create a much more productive and enjoyable environment. It sounds like the M-C EU commission is privy to your situation, perhaps they can offer advice on the best way to transition to a new lab and maintain funding. 

The other option is to just suck it up and finish as fast as possible. But I would worry about your mental health with this option.

fmye2p7,t3_fxw1is,True,timefortea2020,t2_5ljmeij7,"I defended and got my humanities doctorate in 2010. I had several journal articles in okayish journals, a book chapter in an edited volume, had organized several postgraduate conferences, and received 2 prestigious external scholarships to fund the doctorate.  I knew the job market would be tough, but I expected that I would find something. I believed and was told that I was a competitive candidate. When I started, I was told that there were few jobs in the field, and I accepted that. I still thought that if I worked hard enough, I might succeed. Then reality hit.

My applications were a washout on both sides of the Atlantic. Very, very few jobs were posted in my field.I applied for those that appeared, no responses. I got one interview for one of the few non- academia adjacent jobs related to my field. That was a no go.

Fortunately, my PhD-granting institution was able to take me on for a year as a temporary instructor. (It was made clear funding could not exceed that.) Actually, I filled the teaching hole left by my former advisor who left our shrinking field for a more secure job in our adjacent non-academic field. So yeah. A year spent temporarily at the literal desk formerly occupied by my advisor.

Of my cohort, only a handful ever found academic jobs in our field. It was a washout. *My former department is still turning out PhDs, and  I have absolutely no idea where they are ultimately placing - there has been a severe lack of academic jobs in the field for the past decade.*

Ultimately, I decided to do a second master's in a different area with more teaching opportunities. I have now been in my current job for 5 years on an annually renewed contract.  It is not the career I imagined, but I generally enjoy teaching (in spite of the COVID-19 washout semester we are currently in). I am very fortunate to have a partner in a good, stable job. This made getting the second master's possible and compensates for my okay-but-not-great FT NTT salary.

Thinking back to 2010, I can offer the following advice/comments:

1. Sometimes it isn't you. There are many good candidates.
2. Look after your mental health. The academic job market can be draining. I felt a massive sense of failure, guilt, and regret for a long time.
3. Formulate some kind of backup plan in terms of a career/job.
4. You will eventually reach a point at which you no longer want to apply/ it feels futile. Once you reach that point, assess whether you are still a viable candidate/want to continue. For me, after a year of applying to different things in my tiny field, I knew it was time to peace out. Jobs were going to candidates with far more years and publications under their belt.

&amp;#x200B;

It was hard to say goodbye to my field. Even though I was no longer in the field, I eventually published my thesis as a book. Since then, I have moved on to new things and no longer identify as being  a X \[insert noun form of person in field\]. It was sad and difficult, but I am in an okay place now. Part of me does regret not leaving teaching entirely - a NTT job is very risky in the current climate.

Hope this wasn't depressing - it wasn't meant to be. I hope things work out for you. Just know that even if you don't end up working in your field, there will be other opportunities if you pursue them.

I don't really want to sound harsh but if you're saying not much changed w.r.t. your approach to teaching after all this, and also the above, that's not good, you're probably part of the problem.

I've been doing MOOCs on my own time since 2012.  Since then I've self-taught myself programming, then did a BA in literature, then self-taught linguistics and started an MA in linguistics last September. In the last 8 years I probably watched hundreds of hours of online lessons on youtube, used many MOOCs and read a tonne of material, be it usual online resources or books. All in all, if I rinse and repeated that ten times, it would not equal a semesters worth of proper learning.  It wouldn't make half of a single seminar course. We lost all that, and almost all our social life, and many of us are struggling with many other problems be it social, health (loved ones falling ill or dying, also mental health), or economic (shitty students' work, and loans).

From a more personal perspective, writing has always been my strong point. Providing care and support for people on the ground, as I’ve been doing for the last few years, has been rewarding, but has taken its toll on my physical and mental health. 

I’m aware that being back in the library after spending a few years “in the field” may bring back some of those “ivory tower”feelings I had as an MA student, but my hope is that bringing my work experience together with my academic background will give me a sense of fulfilment that neither one was able to by itself.

Third - The UK system is different to the US one, so reaching out to supervisors and having publications is really not so much the way it's done. No one cares about social media, so don't worry. 

I have no direct experience of the history field directly, but my expectation is that for a funded route you need to be right on the top of the pile. This is basically true in STEM, and arts and languages are even less well funded.

fmjp5b5,t1_fmjlxjj,True,SurvivingJupiter,t2_45mmqa9l,"Sure. WFH means you won't get any social in the day. Being professional over zoom or skype or slack etc is still draining, you will likely need down time to decompress and/or see friends. Else you risk the trying to treat everyone at internship as new bff which can go really badly with stuff that isn't workplace appropriate. Mental health needs downtime. Unlike classes where you get little breaks, full time work you are expected to be ""on"" and going the whole time except lunch. Endurance is something I've seen a lot of students struggle with in new roles. Commutes like 30min to 2 hrs depending on where you live, thats 1hour to 4 hours gained in a day. That's not enough for a second full time job. 

Second what if meetings concerning research overlap with internship hours? It's likely other students or the PI will check in with you periodically especially if WFH. Are you willing to risk internship thinking you're moonlighting? 

Which is my 3rd point. The internship is full time. They are expecting your full effort, not distracted by research obligations.That means you well rested too. You will want the networks formed by this. You want to have a good impression. 

If those 4 empty weeks are at the end of summer could you start the research then? Or see if there's anything brief you could do for 4 weeks before the internship, full stop, then pickup in the fall? Talk to the PI. 

Worst case of only doing one? You have some bored hours after work to pick up a hobby, read articles, see friends, cook, workout, craft, play video games etc. Worse case of you doing both? You lose friends as no time to see them. You get caught doing both and lose the internship and the opportunities from it. You mess up something due to being not 100% and lose some opportunities. 

It sounds like you are really set on doing 2 internships in one summer. I dont advise that. If you absolutely want it, I would talk to both bosses and get the okay. But I would expect them to have reservations similar to mine and potentially feel like you don't really want their opportunity. 

Oh amd to address b - really solid research experience can happen in a school year. Doing 3-4 months extra in summer won't make or break it.

Perhaps to help you better understand the multiple roles grad students juggle, here's my experience. Most graduate research fieldwork is over the summer. Mine is 11/12 months of the year, w ~5 months working 60-80 hours/week, hiking and driving up steep cliffs, carrying packs, caring for animals. I also take courses, TA, have other lab responsibilities as an RA, train and mentor undergrads, and lead volunteer efforts during this. Before the pandemic I worked side gigs during my ""lesser"" weeks of ~50 hrs/week, bc as grad students know well, we're not paid much. Tbh your example of waking up at 5 AM, done by 5 PM, that wouldn't phase anyone that does fieldwork, especially with wildlife. But I'd still take my actual field research over any other job. It's the analyses, writing, *thinking* that I'm totally burnt out on. That was the point of this post. 

As for putting food on the table, I hope most grads have career objectives in mind before pursuing higher education. It sounds like the lieutenant you knew did not, and that happens!

And again, starting off by an MA is, in my opinion, the best way forwad. It's grad work, you get a taste, you specialize a bit, and you get a good idea of what it'd be like to do a PhD, without the all or nothing of a PhD program. You can always enroll in a PhD and you will have covered many (most, actually) of the courses required prior to starting your research. In other words, it's not an extra year or two that you add in. Regardless, put yourself and your mental clarity and balance FIRST.
Best of luck.

Edit: regarding your question about your mental health as a reason for having performed below your capacities in undergrad...you not need to disclose any of that, and if you choose to do focus on NOT victimizing yourself. A quick ""I underwent some severe mental health patches in my undergrad which partly account for my performance in some courses"" should do. Right after, show how you did very well in other courses, to counterbalance and to underscore the good, not the bad.

Regarding good habits to get into that can help you: find a good system that works for you in terms of keeping up with the literature. Keep an annotated bibliography, and thematize it. Attend talks and lectures, ideally go to conferences if you can. Learn about the ""art"" of giving paper presentations and behaving like a scholar among other scholars.

g2scmtk,t1_g2nw64g,True,needlzor,t2_43i1t,"&gt; Or should I be asking potential advisors if I’ll be having time to write?

Advisors who are desperate for students will say anything to have you work with them. They will also behave perfectly for the first 6 months, until it's time to start courting their next victim, at which point they will throw you into a metaphorical dungeon and begin their hunt. I used to think I could detect this behaviour by looking at the size of the student pool of an advisor: PhD farmers tend to have a lot more students than the ""normal"" ones, but then I met with people who supervised 12-15 PhD students and somehow made time for all of them so I know my rule of thumb isn't good, but it can be an indicator. 

My only piece of advice would be to contact a few of their students (with different starting dates) and ask them about their opinion of the lab and their research environment. Mention that you are thinking about applying under their advisor but don't ask them directly about the advisor - if they are a psycho they will tell you by themselves. Ask them how the university is treating them, how much time they have to write, what the expectations are, etc. If one of them seems talkative offer to buy them a coffee at the school cafeteria (grad students rarely refuse free coffee) to ask them follow up questions in person (but at a distance, COVID and all). 

It takes a bit of time but think of it as your first research project, with the null hypothesis being ""spending the next 5 years in this institution and under this PhD advisor will not harm my mental health"".",1,2020-08-25 10:40:40
g2odgu0,t1_g1sr4na,True,LankyTower,t2_33g5203t,"Hey thanks for the reply!! Ooh fair I'm guessing something social sciencey then so I'm sure you know what you're talking about. And that makes sense, I suppose one's capacity to be a good student transcends your level of study at the end of the day. I would say I'm not a terrible student, I just had a bit of a rough time before getting to uni and I needed some time to work stuff out after having got away from some of the bad stuff at home, and unfortunately that coincided with starting my degree. I try to make the effort in lectures and seminars and I read a lot outside of whats set just because I'm interested in everything we're doing but I just need to get better at organizing myself sometimes and then hopefully I'll be golden (luckily the uni is giving me free counseilling for that so woo).

And yeah, everything you're saying is completely fair, I can't imagine its exactly a walk in the park but I do realise nowadays that my own mental health should be at the fore of my considerations in life. I have been thinking maybe go for a masters like you said and see how I feel from there as maybe it will be a good gauge as to whether I'm suited for study beyond that. I suppose I do feel like I've got my life together sufficiently with several years now of being far more aware of my mental health and having been treated for it now I do feel far more resiliant than when I started but I do take your point it is rather like playing with fire. And again, yeah no I completely agree, the academic job market does look rather abysmal especially at the moment, and especially for a subject like social anthro, I suppose I just genuinely love it as a subject so much that I do feel a genuine desire to go as far as I can with it in terms of qualifications and training, I just need to be wary of what you're saying about academic jobs as well. I've got myself trained in business admin and the postgraduate course I'm looking at also has a big filmaking element to it and I've been trying to teach myself to edit video footage so that maybe whilst I'm doing postgrad and maybe beyond if the jobs are scarse at the time I can always have a supplementary form of income. But I completely see where you're coming from and it's definately something I'll factor into my decision of what I do in terms of study.

And thanks dude, I really hope you do too, one thing I will say is that none of the jobs I've had outside academia (at least here) have really cared about mental health, and in some cases have almost preyed on it to get me to work beyond my means, and at least in academia in the UK there does seem to be a lot more understanding of people's limits when it comes to this stuff, but obviously it can always be better.

My dream really is to go to Manchester and they’re quite competitive for anthropology so I’m just thinking would a transcript with lots of blanks on look a bit bad even if it was for mental health reasons?

And yeah that makes sense, I’ve been asking myself a lot whether I think this career path is right for me and whether I’m actually cut out for it but I genuinely want to do it so badly, like past the kind of idealist dreams of what it would be like I feel like I really do want to do a phd so that i can do teaching and research but I realise I obviously need to be in the right state of mind before I start, Will probably think about it a lot more in the meantime

And yeah you’re right again, I suppose it’s just a bit daunting sometimes seeing all these smart looking profiles on LinkedIn and researchgate etc just makes you feel a bit slow on the uptake sometimes lol, and yeah I really want to get onto a research assistant role but I’m unsure how to go about it really, I’m going to email my tutor in the next few days and mention it but yeah just because we have a really small department and covid seems to have messed up 90% of our research projects I just worry that this kind of thing won’t be practical next year, but I will definitely try to find one though it’s a really good suggestion, I will definitely be doing a masters first I think I’m ok with a bit more student finance and I get welsh sf so I get a pretty good deal

g2lcoqr,t1_g2l3lpy,True,ExplainsSocialNorms,t2_xztrr,"&gt; That implies that it's either bloated unnecessarily, or that new tasks or more of the old tasks need to be done. That said, I'm not really sure what those new administrative positions actually do,

It's a little bit of both, which is what makes defining ""administrative bloat"" so challenging.

On one hand, there are the endless VPs and deanlets making inflated salaries to do very little, and the assistants to these people who work hard for low pay but wouldn't be needed if we didn't have an Office of Useless Paper Pushing to begin with. We could easily get rid of a lot of those sorts of positions, but at most schools, only a handful of administrators make big money, and some of them have to pay that much if you don't want someone completely incompetent doing the job. 

The obvious solution is to cut the waste (thus saving at least some money) and promote from within the faculty to fill the top administrative positions whenever possible. The catch is that most faculty don't want to spend all their time begging alumni for donations and many aren't great with admin details, so finding a willing and able candidate may be challenging. I'd like to see top admin positions start going to unemployed PhDs and exploited humanities adjuncts, but fat chance of that ever happening!

On the other hand, the university's legal obligations have grown and so have students' needs. As the university serves a more diverse population, you need more staff to help students transition into college. For instance, if you have a bunch of first generation college attendees, they need more help navigating the university's byzantine bureaucracy and strange, opaque norms. In part, the problem is that the university is filling in for non-existent social services that *should* be provided by the state but aren't. Healthcare costs for faculty and staff have increased, and so have the costs of providing mental healthcare to students. 

This is the difficult part. Do you rollback regulations, at the risk of for-profit hellholes exploiting students or letting profs sexually harass students or leaving disabled students to fend for themselves? If not, you need staff for that. Do you cut student health services just because it should technically be the community in general that provides such things to all people (not just students) who need it? If so, does that mean we don't care about students who have mental or physical health problems? Do you cut programs designed to foster success among students who face greater challenges (e.g. first-gen, diverse populations)? If so, isn't that stacking the deck in favor of students with more social and economic capital?

Some of this work could probably be done by faculty and graduate/professional students (e.g. get the law school to help with compliance, assign faculty mentors for at-risk students, staff the health center with as many psych grad students and med students as legally permissable) but like...do you want to take time away from research and teaching to do that kind of thing?

When most universities in America are located in underserviced rural areas and aspire to serve such diverse populations, from students from underperforming high schools to disabled students to older students, it's inevitable that they become self-sufficient min-cities - which implies a variety of non-faculty employees that are central to student success.",1,2020-08-23 13:20:21

It will, however, leave a “bad mark” of sorts on the department that runs the training program, since they have to report to the NIH what all their supported students have gone on to do. I would think about the motivations of this professor in giving you this advice, as he/she may not have your best interests in mind.

If it is an F31 (though it doesn’t sound like it), an early termination is not a big deal. They are happy to take the money back and know that circumstances can change. This changes a little once you are a postdoc - as the first year of an F32 would have to be paid back to the NIH if you quit the fellowship within the first year. 

But I’ve never heard of anyone being blackballed from NIH funding for moving programs or exiting funding early.

As someone in a major where a Masters or PHD is certainly valuable enough to find myself tempted into grad school, I say get out now. Students spend 13 years in a crap education system just for another 4 years tacked on so we can get the bare minimum to reasonably enter the work force at decent wages. Tack on a 4-6 year PHD program and you're almost 30 before you enter the real world or get an actual job in your field of study. My impression of college academia after my 1st year is that it is inherently insular, suffocating, and downright meticulous on how much obsession is required to reasonably thrive in this environment for a job I'll learn most of the valuable skills for after graduation. (Lots of weedout classes where I'm at so I'm a bit bitter.) If I had to work a job that dominated my life this much for more than a 6 month contract I would quit from the burnout and find something that let me thrive more. It sounds like you're in a similar situation except at a much greater cost than just your mental health. (ie. Tuition and lost wages.)  


Just get out man, if you have a bachelor's then YOU HAVE MADE IT. You've crossed the finish line, and if this is the bare minimum then don't take any shame in that because at the end of the day doing a good job with the bare minimum is better than self destructing on a track that isn't even your own aspiration any more. Forget what sounds right on paper or what is best for your future... because frankly you don't know jack about the future if this pandemic is any indicator.

My dad wasn't abusive, per se (there's an argument for  unintentional emotional abuse though), but I'm pretty sure he has undiagnosed borderline personality and/or bipolar (especially given our family mental health history and both his kids, myself included, having a bipolar diagnosis). He went off-the-rails any time anything triggered him my whole childhood. This was often directed at me (I was the scape-goat), so I have some *very* unhealthy issues with authority that I tend to transfer to authority figures in my life (professors, bosses, etc). Unlike you though, I don't want to be loved by them, I'm very oppositional - which is also really not good. My first instinct is to fight with anyone who tries to control me in any way, but my brain takes someone just being my teacher or my boss as trying to control me... so... lots of issues there. 

I know therapy is frustratingly slow, but it does work - over 20 years later and I'm so much healthier in pretty much every single way (even things I didn't go to therapy for, just because it's been over 20 years of working on my mental health).

This is probably more difficult during the pandemic, but when this is over, set-up a pub night (if you can legally drink) or invite your classmates to a local diner. It might not make the pull go away, but it might help you refocus and still build some strong relationships. 

The other thing I've done is find a career with a very horizontal hierarchy (hello, community college!). I found it far too triggering to work in environments with strict vertical authority and hierarchy, so even when I worked in industry jobs, I would seek out companies that were more horizontal in structure (the more the place is into ""company culture"" and being ""cool"" the more I've found they lean towards coaching-style management instead of authority-style management. This doesn't necessarily help you in this exact moment, but you may find that if you tend towards transference with authority figures, finding environments with less authority will help in life.",1,2020-08-20 14:19:17

Editors aren't in the business of embarrassing themselves and ruining their journals' reputations by publishing trash, so if the journal is reputable, then your article is being published because it's publishable.

Two specific issues I see here: 

**1) You're overestimating how closely most academics will read your work.** We have so much to do and so little time. Yes, there may be a handful of people who end up reading your article closely because it ties directly into something they're working on. But they're reading it *for what they can get from it and use in their own work.* They're not interested in meditating deeply on its flaws unless you've said something egregious.

**2)** **You have an unsubstantiated sense of panic about how they'll interpret or react to an inconsistent sentence/paragraph/section.** To be frank: no one is as preoccupied about this article as you. Most scholars are generous readers who will see that you tried, but stumbled or failed to pull something off in a particular section. Other scholars won't notice, because what you perceive as a flaw doesn't relate to the elements they're interested in. Anyone who notices and *does* take issue with your inconsistent treatment of XYZ will forget about it pretty much as soon as they put your article away. People have many demands on their time, and your piece is just one of many that they'll read in a given day or week.

Even when we read things closely and form nuanced opinions about them, we don't spend our free time imagining how incompetent the author must be ***if they haven't actually demonstrated true incompetence.*** What you're describing is just your own sense (not verified by anyone else) that you didn't explain a distinction well enough. 

**I have a strong suspicion that no matter how this essay turned out, your brain would have chosen** ***something*** **to cling to as evidence of your failure.**

So, I say this kindly and without judgment: **consider therapy.** A competent and compassionate mental health professional can help you navigate the distorted cognitive and behavioral patterns you feel stuck in. To be clear--I'm *NOT* trying to armchair diagnose you, and we **ALL** experience distorted thinking. Common examples include catastrophizing, black and white thinking, mind reading, etc.

The vast majority of academics--whether graduate students or faculty--would benefit from therapy, even in the short term. There are many false narratives that romanticize and idealize what it means to be an academic. One common element is that **they mistakenly tie one's self-worth to one's research/teaching in a way that diminishes and demoralizes people.** Institutions need people to buy into these narratives, because they're what convince us to work as an adjunct teaching five classes at three different universities for $1500 a class without health benefits. I say this as someone lucky enough to be on the tenure track.

Others have mentioned something else important, which is that you've learned a valuable lesson about how ***your perfectionism actually becomes a form of self-sabotage.*** By continuously nitpicking at the article, you actually lowered its quality (at least in your estimation). This is, again, something a trained professional can help you overcome.

My perspective is informed by the fact that although I grew up very poor, I ultimately earned my doctorate from an Ivy, held a fellowship at another Ivy, and am now a young professor at a top public R1. Many of my friends from these institutions and others have been unable to get TT positions over the years, despite their accomplishments. I love what I do, and I'm good at it, but it doesn't determine my value or anyone else's.

I got a BA, two MAs and a PhD. I teach undergrad and grad students, at the BA, MA and PhD levels. Some of them are great, some of them mediocre, some of the rather poor students. Each one of them comes from a different background. This is what I think, and I hope it helps you.

The thing that matters the most is your health. Whatever you choose to do, do it so that you grow better, brighter and bigger. Make your choices open doors. Don't set yourself up for failure. And if you've been depressed and even suicidal, don't play with fire.

I'm a pretty easygoing guy. Happy-go-lucky, no drama. I got into my PhD program and became depressed, gained 40 pounds in 3 and a half years, started having anxiety, palpitations and panic attacks every day or two. I'd wake up in the middle of the night having nightmares. Its been a fews years since I graduated and I still get anxious some times. PhDs in the US (in top schools) can be brutal. Don't put yourself through that. In the UK theyre more relaxed, but the uncertainty of the job market can make it awful. As a social anthropologist you will not be in a good spot to become a lecturer (since that's what you want). And as a degree, it won't open you amhy more doors than a MA would. It's possible that once you graduate you'll land a postdoc, maybe two. But the academic job market is DREADFUL. And thag will mess up with you loads. 

The reason I brought up my students earlier is because I see many of them go through the same I went through in grad school. Even the ones who come with a possitive disposition have troubles finding a nice position. Most of them end up giving up after a while and try to get a job in industry or the government.

I wish I could say it gets better after graduation, but that's a big disclaimer about research - it will never be done, no matter how much you work, there is not some magic time when you have ""discovered enough"" and can cool off. It took me awhile, buried in my own work, to realize this - I spent some time with a few ""big"" shots in my field who were approaching their 90s and still going to lab, they certainly didn't seem like they had ""gotten"" anywhere. People who feel like they have made that type of a contribution are probably arrogant asses.

The good thing is that there are also a ton of people out there in academia/research/what have you who understand this, and are still happy, fulfilled by it, and most importantly, understand that their work is only a small part of their life. I know it seems impossible to have all that, and maybe it is for certain people in certain careers (for instance, I realized quickly that working as a professor at a big fancy school was definitely not for me). 

But I am absolutely convinced (though I sometimes forget it) that research is not worth going into, and it is doomed to fail in general, if it is going to keep asking people to sacrifice their lives and mental health to practice it as a profession. No matter how many papers, citations (yuck), etc. people have, if they are making your or other people's lives shitty by making you work too hard then academia would be much better off without them. A future of grimmer and grimmer competition and work addition is not something the vast majority of people want to be a part of. 

Sorry for the novel. This is all to say that you are worth far more than your work, and you should not feel bad about thinking that. There should be people at your institution that are paid to help with this (at least there were even at the fairly conservative university (Texas A&amp;M) in the US where I did my studies, I went to a lovely therapist from day one).

You can absolutely do a PhD with a 2:1! That’s still a great degree, and the majority of unis, including research intensive universities (e.g., Russel Group) accept a 2:1 for PhD programmes. It shouldn’t reflect badly on you that you took longer to get your degree. You can always disclose it as “medical reasons” &amp; most wouldn’t ask further questions than that. Good grades don’t necessarily mean someone will be cut out for a PhD, and the opposite is also true! 

I know it’s cliche, but I’d try to not compare yourself too much with other peers who may appear to have more on their CV. I can almost guarantee that those folx would just as easily be able to find someone else’s CV that makes them feel the same sort of imposter syndrome you’re feeling right now. We all feel that way sometimes. In terms of things you can do to boost your academic profile, I’d suggest trying to get a Research Assistant position at a uni. Even if it’s not in your exact field, it’ll give you great research experience, the pay is usually decent &amp; it’ll look great on applications. If a masters is an option for you, that would also be beneficial, both in experience &amp; as another qualification, but it can be very expensive to do so.

My project for example is partially funded by a local government body looking to invest in local biodiversity and climate science.
2. I have an unbelievable amount of opportunity here compared to America. I went back briefly after my first stint here and it was not good for my health or well being because my basic needs weren't being met and I was overworked. I could not find work anywhere in my field because they did not fund basic things. I worked for the Parks Service on a major, major US history site and we had our budgets cut when the new admin came in.
3. Speaking of which, there is the stability of that funding is a lot more consistent here from personal experience. 
4. Better data accessibility within my own field.
5. People here don't generally fight me that climate change is a thing, thus making it easier to teach and a relief on my own mental health.
6. I can afford to treat my mental health and physical health before things become a problem.
7. Food quality is better, so I am healthier.

g1g6j7b,t3_i99nw6,True,pastaandpizza,t2_5g1cw,"I was ""unbiasedly"" diagnosed by a new doctor.  I moved cities to start my post-doc so I had to find a new primary care doctor.  On my first visit they had me fill out a long health questionnaire on an ipad.  When he came in to see me he basically asked when I was diagnosed with ADHD and I laughed and was like sorry you've got the wrong patient.

He said on my survey I scored very high for adult ADHD.  I laughed again and said doesn't everyone score for ADHD nowadays? No one can pay attention to anything for more than a second.  He was not laughing with me and basically said less than 5% of new patients score for ADHD and those that do are mostly all already diagnosed and that we had to address this during this visit.  

Without knowing anything about me he said that there is a large group of people my age (25-25) that weren't diagnosed as kids because 1) we grew up in an environment were ADHD wasn't widely considered ""real"" by that generation of parents 2) were smart enough to be able to get by in school ie you could still do your home work without paying attention to 100% of the lesson in class 3) having good grades means you were less likely to get flagged for behavior issues which typically are the tipping point for psych evals as kids 4) are currently still high achieving academically 5) have found methods to ""self-medicate,"" particularly caffeine addictions or habits you need to stabilize your mood.

I was embarrassed that I literally checked off every single box.  I was like well doc, I just got my PhD and I drink 64 ounces of caffeinated drinks a day, but I don't really think I have the symptoms of ADHD.  He basically told me I fit the mold so well that if I were to try medication for it I would instantly realize what my symptoms are, as they can vary between people, and the extreme 180 of being on the meds will make what was ""wrong"" before super clear once the meds make it ""right"".  

Taking my first Ritalin completely changed my world view.  The very first thing that changed was not what I expected. Taking out the trash used to cause me physical discomfort - tension in my chest and neck and just an overall mental dread of thinking I have to take the trash out - and I just assumed everyone was like that.  When my wife would take out the trash I just assumed it was a passive aggressive move against me, because its such an awful task she's just showing me she's willing to do it and I'm not. 30 minutes on my Ritalin, while I was thinking ""this stuff isn't working at all"" my wife asked me to take out the trash and I was like yea sure and took it out no problem.  Why WOUDLN'T I want to take out the trash? It would make the kitchen smell bad if I didn't and it's like 10 steps from the trash can to the garage.  When I walked back inside and realized I had just basically *wanted* to take out the trash I nearly cried.  To think how many things in my life have been difficult, which could have been easier, and to think how many times I completely misjudged other people's actions based on my assumptions (my wife taking out the trash was somehow passive aggressive and not a normal or kind gesture of taking care of our home??) just completely rocked me.

That being said, I don't respond super well to medications (non-stimulants give me bad side effects and even max dose extended release stimulants only last a total of 6 hours a day for me) but just knowing and understanding the condition has helped me significantly.

All you can do is manage it so that you only do these tasks during certain windows of time. This may not sound like enough, since you're asking about how to avoid this unfortunate reality, but it makes a massive difference. 

One small example (with huge ramifications) is writing on my syllabi that I **don't respond to emails after 6pm or on weekends**. (Ideally, I also don't check my email either, but this can vary. Regardless, no replies.)

I also **don't check work email before noon** on most days.

It means my mornings (unless I'm teaching) are purely for myself and my research. It also means that no matter what happens in the afternoon, I've accomplished what I need to take care of myself (a nice breakfast or a gym workout) and to move forward in my career.

You train others how to treat you and what to expect from you. If you're sending out/responding to departmental or student emails at all hours, then they will think of you as a 24-hour ATM.

We’ve also gotten regular emails about mental health issues, including a comprehensive list of the resources available.  When everyone was truly locked down in the spring, we had a ton of opportunities for wellness (workouts, yoga classes, guided meditations) and cultural events via Zoom, although that’s lessened during the summer.

The question of where you want to end up is really pertinent here. If you want to end up teaching at a 4-year institution in any capacity, you’ll almost certainly need a PhD. That said, even in a field like CS where external funding is relatively plentiful, faculty positions are very difficult to get at the best of times and likely much more difficult for the next decade as higher ed realigns and adjusts to the post-COVID world. Those faculty positions which do and will continue to exist are almost certainly going to emphasize research, at least at the point of hire. Plus, 4-year schools that hire tenure track faculty with a higher teaching commitment, like liberal arts colleges, are likely to take a bigger hit from the current economic and public health crises and be in a worse position to hire new faculty in the coming years. As already pointed out, you’re likely looking at contract positions (lecturer, adjunct) which will pay significantly less and range from 1 to 3 years in length, with or without the possibility of renewal. Also, in an economic downturn, contract faculty are liable to be let go as a cost cutting measure with more of their burden getting shifted to tenure/track faculty. 

So, it sounds like you’re aiming for less choice positions since you’re not really as interested in research jobs. In a lot of fields this wouldn’t necessarily be a problem since these might be jobs that fall off the radar of those who really want the more choice positions. However, in higher education, the cycle is a killer here. Tenure track and prestigious contract jobs/fellowships get advertised in the fall. This is also where you’ll find those longer term lecturer positions (ex. 3 year renewable “semi-permanent”) but even though these may be teaching focused, the coin of the realm is research and if a school can get somebody who’s a very good teacher and a very good researcher they may take them over someone who’s an excellent teacher and a middling researcher. Teaching focused contract positions (think shorter term lecturers and adjuncts) typically get advertised later in the spring when programs know where their teaching gaps will be for the next year (ex. Who’s on sabbatical.) This application pool gets flooded with applicants who didn’t get tenure track jobs in the fall cycle, so you’re going up against a pool that’s just as big and qualified. 

Making a living on short contract positions in higher ed (your 1 year lectureships, 2 year VAPs, adjuncting gigs) can be difficult, bordering on impossible in some cases. It’s not even a matter of the low pay (which can be very low) but also of the insecurity of knowing that you need to apply for jobs year after year because you’re only on a 1 year contract. There’s also the matter of maybe having to move every year or two or three because your contract in one place ended and you got another 1-year job 2 or 3 states away. This may sound hyperbolic, but I assure you it’s not. I have friends who have been taking 1 or 2 year contract teaching positions for almost a decade and are emotionally and mentally cored out from having to uproot themselves (and in some cases their families) regularly and move somewhere new while knowing they likely can’t get too comfortable there because they’ll probably be gone in another year. This is aside from having to learn new systems and departmental politics. 

Before the economic downturn, I would have recommended that folks who are interested in teaching should look at liberal arts colleges. That market is now both saturated and taking a financial beating, probably to the point where many schools will close or at least will take several years to get their hiring going. Even if they’re “back to normal” in 7-9 years when you finish a PhD (if you plow straight through) you’re going to have to worry about the backlog of all of the folks who graduated between now and then and who are still on the market hunting. 

This has all been a very long-winded way of saying “be very careful and systematic if you want to teach without doing research at a 4-year institution.” If you do want to teach, your best bet is going to be hitting that research hard, despite these early frustrating experiences. Another option might be to look at 2-year institutions. Find a CS instructor at a local community college and see what their life is like and what the credentials are. Because of pay scales, CCs have tended to favor instructors with a Master’s vs. those with a PhD, but that depends talk to people on the ground and see what they have to say.

g0j88b8,t3_i4m477,True,Licanius,t2_3rzyj7,"Yeah, this is a tough one. There are positions that are permanent that are teaching only in university departments, especially departments that are research intensive, because they need to cover teaching releases for professors who get big grants to focus on research. This means that well-payed teaching-only positions do exist, but I've only ever met a few people with these positions. What's way more common is the lecturer position, which don't pay well, as you've mentioned, and also have next to no job security. This is enough downside for no academic in their right mind to feel comfortable recommending that career path to an undergraduate.

As for research... research is hard. Even when you have a good supervisor, things can be really frustrating. There's a reason why so many graduate students have mental health issues. But research can also be so interesting and rewarding that people decide that the tough bits are worth it. As you have specific courses on conducting research coming up, I'd wait and see if you find it more enjoyable. 

I guess I would recommend that you wait and see how the next year goes, and if you're still interested in teaching at the university level, to try a master's out.  If after a master's, you realize it isn't for you, at least you'll have a master's in a CS area and probably be pretty hireable if you play your cards right in other ways during your degree. If you decide you don't like research, maybe a position at a college is more likely to not be research-heavy?

fznyvec,t3_i0875x,True,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"It's very normal to feel nervous before starting a Ph.D. program! After all, the fact that you've made a commitment of 5-6 years to a specific program, field, and city is starting to feel real now. Certainly, doctoral programs all involve a level of stress, and it makes sense to feel concerned about that, too.

A few tips:

1. Your advisor wouldn't have selected you if you weren't qualified. And, at the same time, being qualified doesn't mean that you don't have a lot to learn. There will be things that feel challenging to learn and many stresses along the way, but none of that means that you aren't cut out for this. You'll learn and grow over the course of your program.

2. A doctoral program is a not-insignificant chunk of your life. It's still your life, so do your best to treat it that way. (I'll admit, I wish I would have listened to this advice more myself in grad school.) Take the time to explore your new city. Work to establish a new network of friends--even now when everything is virtual, and especially once it's safe to do in-person things again. (That can include your cohort of fellow grad students who will also be in a new city where they may not know anyone!) I encourage you to avoid resigning yourself to being lonely for the next several years. You can complete a Ph.D. program and also build strong relationships. But you may have to take extra efforts to make that a priority.

3. If you're worried about your mental health, be proactive now. Consider seeking out therapy in the university's counseling center or broader community, especially as you navigate this difficult transition. (Most universities will offer e-therapy due to COVID, if safety is a concern for you.) And concerns about mental health are all the more reason to prioritize establishing a good support network and taking care of yourself in other ways (e.g., getting exercise, getting ample sleep, eating well, etc.).

Also, I never falsely ascribed you any positions as far as I can tell.  My stance is that prospective hires should not be screened because of the role of screening as a discriminatory practice.  I don't really know why you're describing me as 'nasty""; I went back over my posts and it doesn't seem like I was trying to attack you.

I'm simply trying to answer your question: 

&gt; Should prospective hires be screened for grandiose narcissism, given that this personality disorder is allegedly disproportionately represented among faculty and that Millennials allegedly score higher on average on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory? 

Screening may be unlawful under Title I of the ADA

&gt;Title I requires employers with 15 or more employees to provide qualified individuals with disabilities an equal opportunity to benefit from the full range of employment-related opportunities available to others. For example, it prohibits discrimination in recruitment, hiring, promotions, training, pay, social activities, and other privileges of employment**. It restricts questions that can be asked about an applicant's disability before a job offer is made**, **and it requires that employers make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities, unless it results in undue hardship.** Religious entities with 15 or more employees are covered under title I. ( [https://www.ada.gov/cguide.htm#anchor62335](https://www.ada.gov/cguide.htm#anchor62335) )

This site also offers some clarification:

&gt; [https://www.jgllaw.com/blog/can-employers-conduct-mental-health-screenings#:\~:text=Because%20serious%20mental%20illness%20is,phase%20of%20the%20hiring%20process.](https://www.jgllaw.com/blog/can-employers-conduct-mental-health-screenings#:~:text=Because%20serious%20mental%20illness%20is,phase%20of%20the%20hiring%20process.)   
&gt;  
&gt; In regard to potential hires, the ADA prevents employers from asking questions about disability status during a pre-employment interview. **Because serious mental illness is considered a protected disability under the ADA, employers should not conduct any type of screening for mental illness during the interview phase of the hiring process**. 

Since your initial questions involves the screening of prospective hires, then it seems that institutions should not be legally allowed to do that as it is illegal to questions a person's disability status during pre-employment.

It would seem it is also illegal to attempt to identify any possible mental health issues in the pre-employment process.

Also, I'm not sure if NPD is necessarily categorized as a disability, but it apparently has a high rate of comorbidity with other mental disorders ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic\_personality\_disorder#Comorbidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder#Comorbidity) ). 

I think maybe rephrasing the question would help.  You point out in another comment that you wanted to 'spark a spirited discussion' but the question is declarative and seeks a declarative answer: ""Should prospective hires be screened...""  I say no, because it is possible it is illegal under the ADA and personally I think it seems rather arbitrary.

Your position seems to be that the screening should occur given some of your comments on other posts.  

I think a better way of asking this is ""Would screening faculty and students for Narcissistic Personality Disorder be ethical?"" or ""What are the ethical implications of screening faculty and students of an academic institution for personality disorders?"" or ""What would the be the costs versus the benefits of screening personnel? or something in that vein.",1,2020-07-24 12:56:57

There are a lot of variables at play here. Is this a report of past mental health challenges that are now well managed, or does it refer to ongoing concerns? If you in fact have tenure, the bar for taking away tenure from a professor is high, but it will vary from institution to institution; reporting past suicidal thoughts should not cross that line, but reports of certain types of behavior might (particularly if there are any crimes, etc.). If on the tenure track, I do not imagine that you could 'count' such a book toward a tenure application unless it directly relates to your field of research (e.g., clinical psychology). Ultimately, while I fully believe in de-stigmatizing mental illness, I also cannot guarantee that writing about your mental health challenges will not contribute to the attitudes of your colleagues.

1. Refer yourself to student welfare. Explain the manipulation that you are being made a victim of. Explain your mental health background. Make sure they know the whole situation.
2. Provide any evidence you can that your landlord has been leveraging you this way.
3. Anticipate a collapse of your relationship with your landlord - explore alternative accommodation arrangements, and - where possible - see if student welfare are able to help. This is going to be hugely variable from universities to university, let alone country by country.
4. With student welfare engaged, report the academic misconduct. At this point the welfare team should be able to act alongside you, or at least provide some support or even representation.

Without knowing the extent of activity which can actually be evidenced, or how your academic misconduct panel and welfare team react it's impossible to really say what the outcome is likely to be. There will certainly be some consequence to you, but it could range anything from  warning to expulsion.",1,2020-09-24 08:27:44

g5d5811,t3_it4dxy,True,Opulent_Grapefruit,t2_7pds5n8g,"I totally get it! A few things from a fellow medication user who still frequently copes with focusing issues...

(1) Exercise!

I know there are studies out there to back it up, but I'm not going to go down a rabbit hole to find them since I only have a few minutes left on my Pomodoro timer. I find that I am ***so*** much more focused when I go for a run/bike ride in the morning. There are days when I convince myself I ""don't have time"" to exercise for 20 minutes and then spend the day kicking myself because I waste waaaay more than 20 minutes trying to find focus.

(2) Pomodoro timer

25 minutes of intense, focused studying/5 minute break. There are plenty of apps for this (I use Focus Keeper but also occasionally Seconds Pro which is actually a timer for HIIT exercise lol). Play around with the time intervals and see what works for you, then STICK TO IT and treat it like it's a law you can't break. The minute that break ends, get back to work.

(3) Foam ear plugs underneath noise cancelling headphones

If you have over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones, invest in a large container of foam earplugs. This + noise cancelling + brown noise (personally find it way more tolerable than white noise...buy a track of your choice and play it on repeat) are a MUST. COVID has seriously screwed up my finely honed work habits, but this helped immensely.

(4) Freedom App

I found this really useful as well. There are days where no matter how much I tried, I could NOT get myself off time-wasting websites. There's a free version you can try, but it basically blocks whatever apps and websites you want on all your devices and there's an option you can choose so that there's no way to un-do it until the session is over. I have these set up for repeating sessions throughout the day, which helps keep me focused.

(5) Positive talk

Ok, ok, this one might sound cheesy but it's real. Tell yourself over and over that you are good at working from home/with distraction/etc until you believe it. Take it from someone who had a few breakdowns early on in the pandemic... you have to acknowledge what you're  feeling and how crummy the situation is, but then decide that you're stronger than that, and get back to work.

(6) Stick with a schedule

This one is another crucial one. Set boundaries for yourself. Working from home has made it difficult for everyone...now all of a sudden you're expected to be available via email/zoom/etc at all hours because they know you haven't gone anywhere. I stick with a schedule of when I'm going to work, and when I'm going to call it quits. There is ALWAYS more work to be done, so don't fool yourself into thinking that you have to work for just one more hour. You could work forever and you probably wouldn't be done/caught up.

(7) Know when to take a break

If you set up a schedule and get into a rhythm, but then find that there are days when you **just can't focus** no matter what you do? Call it quits. Trying to force yourself to do work is going to make you miserable, and is just going to cause you to burn out more/be less efficient/repeat the cycle. Take the day off, do something you find truly relaxing and enjoyable, get some exercise, then start again the next day. It's probably a good practice to do this once a week or so....as you go, you'll start to figure out what time span you need between days off. For me, it's around the 9 day mark that I start to crack and know I need to take a day off, so I just build it into my schedule one day before that happens.

.

.

I hope that some of this is helpful. I apologize for writing a post a third the length of Moby Dick, but I totally know the feeling of being miserable because you so desperately want to work but can't. I sincerely hope you (and everyone else feeling this way!) can find some ways to work effectively in these crummy times, while simultaneously taking care of yourself. Wishing you good mental health and a good day.",27,2020-09-15 15:32:35
g5c64wr,t3_isqveo,True,Kireina_Michan,t2_3a602vqk,"It will depend pretty much on the Professor / Lab Head of the lab you are applying, really.

The best thing you can do, of course, is pitch your CV and your motivation letter to the lab you are going to send them to. Make an study of the lab (I am assuming you are applying to a lab / research institution), and evaluate your CV and experience in those terms, so you highlight the aspects you´ve learnt, or the subjects you´ve taken, that most closely relate to the project.

Have an idea of the research they are doing, and try to think about yourself in that context. Mention the things they are doing you feel most motivated about, and the aspects you´d like to work on the most. 

I also recommend you to reach other team members and ask them how is it the work there, the environment, etc. Sometimes, there are places / labs that look awesome from the outside, and when you look inside... they are a nightmare. 

The times I got students (I am a postdoctoral researcher in a Neuroscience lab), the things I appreciated the most on them where: motivation, curiosity, interest and illusion for the work and the project. I think those should be qualities that most of the labs would like to see in their PhD Students... sometimes, more than their marks in the degree (but when you are applying to a position linked to the application of a fellowship... in that case, of course, being above the cut is essential!!)

But, just for your own mental health, I recommend you to make yourself a psychoanalysis, and consider what type of environment you would like to work in, what type of people you would like in your team. There are many many many many different types of labs, and if you get into one that just doesn´t align with your way of being, and your way of working, you will have a hard time. It´s better to wait, being selective, and just join a type of lab that truly aligns with yourself, and where you really feel comfortable. Doing science in an environment that doesn´t work for you, could set a premature end to your career (it has happened to me... but in my postdoc :\_(  and I know it wouldn´t have happened if I had had these aspects in mind)

g58pu9a,t3_ismcij,True,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"This student is new in a Ph.D. program. We're in the middle of a pandemic and everything is harder than before.

I'll also add that there is a large shift between the expectations of being an undergrad volunteering on a research project and being a Ph.D. student. On some level, there may be a need to directly clarify expectations.

I'm glad that you are planning to have a real-time conversation with her. Hear your student out: what challenges is she facing right now, are there expectations that she is unclear about, etc? To the extent that she is experiencing challenges (and no doubt, transitioning to a Ph.D. program in the middle of a pandemic, she is), show empathy. This is hard, no one predicted this a year ago, and it is important that you come from a place of support, not punitiveness.

There is also room for a conversation about the ways in which you would like to see growth. I would very much so frame this as you did in one place above: part of normal growing pains between undergrad and graduate research. Share your expectations with her and explore and discuss what feels realistic for her right now. What feels realistic from her right now may be more than she is doing now and perhaps it's less than what you might like under better circumstances. If everything is remote, know that so much of the socialization to a Ph.D. program happens from informal in-person experiences (e.g., conversations in the lab) that may not be happening right now.

Finally, there may things going on for your student that you are not aware of. These include: mental health concerns, struggling with isolation, fear that vulnerable family members will become ill during the pandemic (or grief and loss, if loved ones have died), or caretaking obligations (e.g., if she has children or elderly parents nearby). While you don't want to pry, per se, know that there may be more going on.

To sum it all up: listen. Come from a place of support--so clearly and explicitly supportive that, even though you may be clarifying your expectations and asking her to do more, she will feel supported. Affirm whatever she is doing well already, share that you see her potential, validate that this is an incredibly difficult time, and acknowledge that the transition from undergrad to Ph.D. student has a learning curve. Make sure it is clear that she is not ""in trouble,"" but that this is an opportunity early on to create a plan for success rather than let the status quo go on longer and create more significant problems. Use ""I"" statements and take great lengths to avoid accusations. Conversations like these are never easy, but how you navigate a conversation like this can make or break how the student feels in your lab and the program, so I encourage you to view this as an opportunity to both help your student get on a better track while also building your rapport with them so that they feel you are a person they can trust going forward.",10,2020-09-14 15:41:10

She may not know she’s not meeting expectations if no one has directly told her what those are, especially coming straight from undergrad. It’s also very important to have some flexibility right now. You never know what else she’s struggling with balancing outside of the program, and I’m sure this is not how she was expecting to start grad school. Everyone’s mental health has taken a hit to some degree. If she’s done well in the past, she probably knows she’s not at peak performance right now. I’d personally normalize her slump in productivity and talk with her about what priorities she’d like to set right now for herself. Also, I’m not sure that it’s always a reasonable expectation for someone to get to an e-mail on the same day it’s sent. There are lots of time when this may require doing some additional work or figuring out the best response. Maybe it’s more reasonable to suggest that she at least try to respond to confirm she’s gotten the email.

My first career I was a musician and did everything “right” in that regard: got into a good, rigorous and well-regarded program and hated it. I am now working in academia and love it (after a winding career road doing a lot of different things). The interesting thing is they’re very similar in terms of pressures and the shiny fantasy you’re sold vs the hard reality it actually is. The biggest difference in me enjoying an being able to work in academia is my mental health hygiene. I have many more tools available to me now that keep me well and even when I get the inevitable rejections, challenges and bumps to my confidence, I can stay even for the most part. Investment into your coping tools is the single most important thing you can do now to be successful. I have done it both ways and I can honestly say, the potential experience you could have of your life is not even conceivable to you yet. It’s hard, hard work that is uncomfortable. It’s not a straight line but slow progress is better than no progress. 

Finally, at this stage, I was given some advice and it really helps when I’m stuck as you seem to feel. Do the next obvious thing. By all means, have big dreams and plans and all the rest. But, when you can’t see the point or what to do with yourself, do the next obvious thing. Big picture, that might be finishing your degree and getting your mental health handled. Small picture, that might mean get out of bed and have a shower.

While it seems like the circumstances you mentioned are causing most of your anxiety, consider that these circumstances might to some extent be the effect of your current mental health. My biggest piece of advice would be to speak to a counselor or therapist. It's rather blase, but they really are good at their jobs, and a good therapist can work wonders. 

Second, don't worry about your career prospects right now. The point of a liberal arts degree is not to simply make you more employable, i.e., the product of a cost-benefit analysis. The beauty of a liberal arts education is that it frees you (""liberal"") to live the life of the mind even outside academia. You don't have to enter the academy or do a PhD to appreciate good art and read powerful works of literature. Regardless of what you end of doing for a career, you're being specially equipped by a liberal arts education to follow your intellectual pursuits to your heart's content.

As for employability, this is an area where the humanities and liberal arts take a lot of flak. But the truth is, as I'm sure you know, studies have shown that liberal arts majors are just as employable as anyone else, and sometimes more desired because of their reading comprehension, critical thinking, and writing skills, etc. It's cliche, but you'll be fine with regards to occupation. You have a ton of time left to figure out what you like to do (your college's career center is invaluable here), and something will always work out. Don't overthink yourself into thinking you regret the choices you made.

Although I don't believe you're as unemployable as you think you are (in fact I think you're mixing up the effects of your diagnoses with an evaluation of your talents/abilities), it certainly seems like academics march to their own drums regardless.

Being neurodiverse feels like being told to drive on a road when everyone else has a car and you have a boat.

I have two suggestions for you:

1. Prioritize your mental health. You don't say whether you're still in therapy, but if not, I encourage you to go back. Going beyond specific diagnoses and medications, I imagine that working with a therapist on exploring this crossroads in your life and on enhancing your self-confidence / not putting yourself down so much may be helpful. You also note that you have ADD; some of your concerns are very common among people with ADD. (That is, you are a bright individual who makes some brilliant connections, yet also struggle with things like organization and time management, and feel guilty and low on yourself as a result.) If you are not already in therapy, you may see if you can find a therapist who specializes in working with adults with ADHD. All of this is a long-winded way of saying: I think working to more effectively manage your mental health concerns may help you to be in a space in which you can more effectively plan and work toward some long-term goals.

2. Your college should have some sort of career center. Use their services! Some things a career center can do for you now include providing career assessment to help you to identify potential areas of interest, and helping you to identify potential jobs and occupations that overlap with your interests, including some potential fields that you may not have heard of or thought about before. For example, as someone interested in intellectual pursuits, there are far more less known options than professor or teacher, just as for someone interested in healthcare or helping others, there are career options other than becoming a doctor. Also use the Career Center's services next year when you are applying for jobs (or sooner, as you apply for summer internships, etc.), schedule appointments well in advance to get feedback about your cover letter and resume/CV. Many career centers will also do interview practice. Figuring out what you want to do next that feels realistic for where you're at now is something that is scary for most students, and you may both benefit from some guidance from professionals who know their stuff, and just knowing that you're not going through the process alone.

I'll also note that, for all of your struggles, you're doing OK. You are thinking about job and career prospects at a time when many students have not yet thought as much about these things. Your GPA, while not the highest, is likely about average for your institution. (Also: as you note you are attending a selective institution, know that you are surrounded by high achieving folks and it can sometimes be difficult to see just how much you have and are accomplishing when ""achievement"" is the water that everyone seems to be swimming in.) I know that you don't feel a lot of hope now. Certainly, at least some of your pessimism is grounded in awareness of some very real personal and professional challenges that exist. But I do not think things are as gloomy as you think they are, and I think that if you take the time now to explore future options and plan for a future career that meets you where you are at, you will be able to find something that you like.",19,2020-09-13 15:43:41

It sounds like academia already exacerbates your mental health problems, so you might be able to find jobs that stimulate your intellectual needs, but down add the pressures of academia. There are other avenues to address your love of literature and critique. You could be an English middle or high school teacher, you could be a copy editor, and so on. The trick is finding that avenue that excites you without making you think you're compromising on your goals.

Academia is an extremely niche kind of field. Not everybody is suited for it, or will succeed in it long term. There isn't any shame in that. Find something that will satisfy you and allow you to live a satisfying life.

You will give up 15-20% of your working years to graduate with a piece of paper giving you few advantages with recruiters compared to where you are now.

Not to mention that you will risk facing the issues you identify with discrimination, toxic culture, and mental health (which will take decades to change).

g4zdmhb,t3_irah9t,True,Verdris,t2_6cki2,"Set boundaries.

Make sure you and your advisor come to an early understanding about your expectations of each other. Learn what your advisor expects of you as a student with regards to work output and time commitment, and ask them what you can expect of them as an advisor. If they have seemingly unrealistic expectations, it's likely that you'll be able to manage them effectively without overworking yourself. 

Codify work hours and stick to them. Grad school is a job. Once you've put in your hours for the day, stop work and go be a person. Working more hours does not mean you produce better work, in fact research shows the opposite is true.

Take weekends off.

There will be exceptions to the above, of course, for example your advisor might need a few paragraphs for a proposal, you may have a deadline suddenly change, or your experiment stopped working one week before a conference. There will be times when you need to crunch in a heroic effort in a short amount of time. Once you push through these times, take a three-day weekend. 

The Pomodoro method and instrumental music work wonders for productivity, as long as you respect the breaks. Read up on this method and you'll understand what I mean. 

Have an exercise routine, even if it's just walking around the block three times a week. You don't need to get swole, you just need to stay active.

Eat well. Drink water. I mean it. 

Talk to people as often as you can, especially during pandemic times. I used to dread lab meetings, but now it's a time to catch up with friends. If your meetings are all ""camera on"", put on some nice clothes. 

Get a good ergonomic chair and do your work at a desk. Don't just slump into the couch with a laptop for 8 hours a day, you'll wreck your back. 

It's okay to take a mental health day once in a while. You don't even have to take a full day off.

A day wasn't wasted as long as you accomplish *something*. Anything like ""I responded to emails"" or ""I gathered the papers I need to read this week"" are good, actionable tasks that you could check off from a list.

If you make to-do lists for work, make them achievable and detailed. Don't put ""write journal article"", instead break it down into the individual steps required. You'll get to tick off more boxes as you go, and it'll be more satisfying to progress. 

Make to-do lists for real life, too.

Multiply your predicted time frame for any deliverable by 3.

Network, and take advantage of any career resources your university offers. Make connections that will serve you well when you graduate. I've seen several colleagues go through their PhD staying laser focused on work, and when they graduate, they have a useless piece of paper and no leads on a job. 

Pick up a hobby that requires some sort of investment. I know money is tight as a grad student, but by investing money into something, you'll naturally want to spend more time with it. Cooking is a good one, you need to eat anyway so why not throw a few extra dollars into better ingredients and some cookware and make excellent meals? It's important to have hobbies because my biggest piece of advice is...

In so much of our culture, we’re taught to expect frequent congratulations and plaudits. It’s typically meaningless and hollow (employee of the month type shit), but between that and hoping for more likes on social media, it’s how our brains are wired. In academic life, any outcome or achievement takes a lot of time. If you can keep your personal life for simple gratification, perfect (I had a cat and biked to and from campus; I looked forward, every day, to biking home regardless of weather, and sitting with my cat to watch TV).

It has never been an issue and they will actually bring it up and offer to try other times, in situations where I would have been quite willing to skip a class.

Having been through my PhD mental health crisis, exercise was the single most important thing I did to make my therapy more effective, and it's the most important thing I do for myself now to hopefully avoid needing therapy again.

Covid makes this harder, but for me it has been the most important buffer around my mental health.

g4xr7ma,t3_irah9t,True,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"First of all, it's so great that you are aware of potential concerns with mental health in your Ph.D. program, because there is so much you can do proactively to both protect your mental health and increase your feeling of well-being. My suggestions to you:

* During this transition period to your Ph.D. program, focus on becoming adjusted to your new program, people, and surroundings. Yes, there will be plenty of work and there can be some learning curves. At the same time, this is an opportunity to establish friendships among your new peers and get to know your new city, if you're moving. Some of that is harder in the pandemic, making it more important for you to be intentional in your efforts to reach out and build connections. Ultimately, having these connections is both good in its own right, and builds a network of social support for when you experience challenges during your program down the line.

* Know what makes you tick. Maybe it's exercise and fresh air, maybe it's cooking special meals, maybe it's artwork or another hobby. Whatever it is that makes you tick, make sure you make room for it still. It can be easy for a Ph.D. program to feel all encompassing, but these are years of your life, too, and it is important to make room for your full self.

* Know when you've done enough and that pushing harder will not help. There is always more that you can be doing, and finding the line to stop at can be difficult in my experience. But sometimes, staying up later to crank out some more work leads to sleep deprivation, which leads to feeling tired and having difficulty focusing the next day. Have priorities (e.g., what must be done now, what can wait) and find a balance between getting your hands involved in the kinds of experiences you want and that will help you to develop your career, while also being open to saying ""no"" when you have enough on your plate.

* Seek out therapy. Notably, you don't have to wait until you're experiencing a mental health crisis to go to therapy. The transition to your program--which, while a good thing, of course--is inherently stressful, and that is reason enough. You can work with your therapist to have a place to process what happens in your grad program and build skills that help you to cope with the ups and downs of your program.

g4xnchg,t3_irah9t,True,Chiquye,t2_awsc1,"Remember it is a marathon. Try to find and make good friends in your program but, maybe more importantly, outside of it. I am in my 4th year and I can tell you that Qual exams are probably the hardest I have been pushed in my academic career. Enjoy coursework and try to make it work toward other long term goals (sections of your dissertation, maybe use it for publications) if that is how it works in your field. 

I would set up a system to take notes and streamline how you study and set up. I am in the humanities so I use things like Zotero, note apps (Evernote), resource organizer (Devonthink. I bought it with my first paycheck), and a word processor (Scrivener). Having a structure that you adhere to is better than racing to finish things constantly. 

Take mental health days. Everyone acts as though you need to work at least 8 hours everyday. Don't do this. I couldn't because I have a family but I watched cohort mates burn out in 8 months doing this. Most switched to 5 days at 8-10 hours or 6 days at 6-9 hours.

For example a post like ""I'm about to quit, all I do is cry all the time, I try to keep going, I'm so scared about what my supervisor or parents would say if they knew the truth etc"" shows the extent of the isolation.

IMO work out your support points before you need them. Make sure you know about your universities mental health services and go there if you get a little low, don't wait until you're really bad. Maybe get a private therapist if you can afford it. Talk to your parents and friends about how some people have mental health challenges during a PhD and ask them to keep track of you.

If your supervisor is unreasonable or puts too much work on you tell them that immediately. Say stuff like ""the amount you gave me last week made me feel overwhelmed and it was a real struggle trying to work on it."" Sometimes a good and caring supervisor can think everything is fine until the blowup happens.

Then there's taking care of your body in other ways. Hydration, vitamins, healthy food, exercise. A PhD is emotionally and physically brutal - you spend all your time indoors hunched over a laptop. You have to take care of your body. Make sure to get out for short (or long!) walks, get some fresh air and sunlight.

Start therapy now so you're already seeing someone you like when your first Very Stressful Event happens. It will happen.

Make friends with other grad students. These are your people now. They're your battle buddies. They get what you're going through and commiseration will help tremendously. 

Build into your schedule dedicated off-screen time. No screens at all. It's best if this is what you do right before bed (better for healthy sleep). 

Develop a routine and maintain those boundaries whenever possible. For example, I have email notifications turn off on my phone at 7pm and I don't work weekends unless I have a big project.

The big exception here is your advisor. It is one thing to not get along great with your advisor, it is another thing entirely to be completely dismissed by them when you come to them with these very important concerns that deserve multiple serious conversations. If I were in your position, I would reach out to someone else like a department chair, someone in the administration involved with student retention, or another professor. Universities generally do not like to let go of PhD students, so you have some leverage. Perhaps they can put you at part-time or give you a semester leave of absence to work on your mental health. They can also help in switching advisors- you will want others on your team so that it is understood that you tried to communicate with your advisor and it was not successful (stay professional - do not bash your advisor and only talk about objective facts). Every program is different, but I’ve known people who switched advisors/had advisors leave and they did not add on significant time to their PhD. At least have some conversations about your options. 

When I was struggling, I knew that I wouldn’t be able to get past it if I dropped out of my program. I know some people who left programs due to bad advisors or having children and they are happy with their decision, but it of course is not a fond memory for them.

My advice isn't going to be perfect, since our situations are different, but I'm in the US in social sciences so here we go. 

I quit my program with no intention of looking back after coursework but before exams. I did occasionally miss it (got intellectually bored from time to time), but I \*never\* regretted the decision nor did I think I \*failed\* b/c I wasn't smart enough. It simply was no longer a fit for me at the time. And I REALLY was happier having the ability to just ""turn off"" in evenings, not stress about work work work all the time. 

Fast forward 3 years later and I have the itch to return. I have a much happier and healthier personal life, I'm married--seems like it's worth reaching out, right? And lo and behold they were thrilled to welcome me back. Needed some shuffling as my PI was just about to retire but they let me back in and worked with me to find a good fit. Another 2 years down the road (to now) and things are going smoothly. I'm entering year 5 now (6 year program normally, so I'm on track), and it's OK. 

Point of the story is not to confirm that you'll regret it -- only you can know that -- but the bigger issue is that whatever you do, you have to do this the right way. It can't be about the advisor, it's about you and your mental and emotional health. If you decide to leave, present it as a desire to seek a different career path for now. If this is still too daunting see if there's a model for taking a leave of absence and getting your mind right.

Do ***not*** pursue a second BA. **The vast majority of universities don't even allow this.** It's also a waste of two precious resources: time and money.

When you apply to Master's programs, apply widely and plan on applying at least twice. Make sure your statement of purpose is clear, concise, and compelling. Your narrative should explain the *specific* reasons driving you to make this transition. You can also make yourself stand out if you can **frame your anthropological background as a benefit, rather than as a lack.**

In other words: while your statement should foreground your familiarity with the field of psychology, you can also explain how this other area of expertise will uniquely inform you as a researcher/mental health professional. (But also make it clear that you understand there are massive differences between these two fields.)

**And if you haven't familiarized yourself with psychology in your spare time, then take a year to do just that.** Read some canonical and contemporary research in the subfields that interest you. Take (not for credit) online courses on Coursera or EdX. Reach out to a psych. professor from your undergrad/grad institution and see if they might be open to a *short* conversation with you about pursuing the PsyD. 

If haven't been doing this already, you should reconsider whether this is the right path for you.

If your application only discusses your interest in psychology in vague terms, then you're not going to convince a committee that you deserve a place in their program. Now, this is also true for people with undergrad degrees in psych., but their obvious training gives them a clear advantage.

Mentorship is not something that you can really achieve outside of a formal environment. You’ll have to wait  grad school if you want that. That said, especially in grad school, you will have to develop enough independence to take initiatives like submitting articles on your own, without your advisor being “moral support.” Your advisor cannot supplement your self-confidence, and it’s not really their job to provide emotional support.

g453cl6,t3_imyua5,True,mafiafish,t2_kl4z9,"First of all, have you sought support from the university and/or medical professionals? I found that talking through problems and anxieties and a few weeks of anti anxiety meds helped me turn things around during the darkest days of my PhD.

Secondly, a little reality check: your life is not going to fall apart if you get a 2:1 in chemistry from Imperial, which it sounds like is the worst case scenario (other than your mental health).

You've presumably got at least one full academic year to pull things back and find more motivation Try to reach for positives, rather than run from negatives. - you'll be surprised how willing academics can be to help you if you ask them in a structured and positive way - it takes courage to admit you're struggling, but given your obvious aptitude, there's no reason you can't catch up and make a higher grade. Do you have the option of taking resits for courses you'd like to improve your grades on?

Don't feel that you can't reach your goals with a low 2:1 - I got the same and still went on to get my DPhil from Oxford after getting my mojo back during an MRes degree.

Finding some support and people who are rooting for you to turn things around, or people holding you accountable in a positive and constructive way can really help to get an alternative source of motivation other than pure passion for the course or subject. After you start seeing improvements and gain a little more confidence you may even get a little boost to motivation given the results.

A warning though, one you've probably read a hundred times - don't do a PhD unless it's a great fit for you and your passions and you like the supervisory team. There's a reason the mental health stats are so bad for PhD students and rushing into one is not to be encouraged and they're kind of all-or-nothing, you don't really get credit for 75% of a PhD like you would for 3 years' experience in industry or business - if you don't complete it, you can feel that you've wasted a chunk of your life and potential earnings.",1,2020-09-05 16:44:59

On the not worth it side:

I got totally screwed on pay scale upon transition, as it is well known that PhDs are coming from salaries of 20-35k (or even less).  This will be used against you and you will not have much leverage at first.  I was offered significantly less than both someone with a Masters who had 1 year in the role and significantly less than someone with a postdoc in the same role with no experience, and I completely outperformed both.  I am in the process of renegotiating my salary while in discussion with another 2 companies that, if I get an offer, would double my salary, PLUS bonus.  

I probably did irreparable damage to my body by over drinking in grad school.  Not good.

I trained myself to rarely seek health care, mental health care, spend money or take vacations during the PhD.  Not good.

The PhD trains you to accept what you have instead of leaving for something better.  Not good.

Didn’t make retirement contributions for a long time.  Not good.

b) Ineligible areas of study

Individuals are not eligible to apply if they will be enrolled in graduate study focused on clinical practice, counseling, social work, patient-oriented research, epidemiological and medical behavioral studies, outcomes research, and health services research. Ineligible study includes pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic, and behavioral interventions for disease or disorder prevention, prophylaxis, diagnosis, therapy, or treatment. Research to provide evidence leading to a scientific basis for consideration of a change in health policy or standard of care is not eligible. Graduate study focused on community, public, or global health, or other population-based research including medical intervention trials is also not eligible.

c) Ineligible proposed research

Individuals are not eligible to apply if they will conduct research for which the goals are directly human disease- or health-related, including the etiology, diagnosis, and/or treatment of physical or mental disease, disorder, abnormality, or malfunction. Research activities using animal models of disease, for developing or testing of drugs or other procedures for treatment of disease or disorder are not eligible. Research focused on basic questions in plant pathology are eligible, however, applied studies focused on maximizing production in agricultural plants or impacts on food safety, are not eligible.

d) Limited exceptions to ineligible proposed research

Certain areas of bioengineering research directed at medical use are eligible. These include research projects in bioengineering to aid persons with disabilities, or to diagnose or treat human disease or disorder, provided they apply engineering principles to problems in medicine while primarily advancing engineering knowledge. Applicants planning to study and conduct research in these areas of bioengineering should select *biomedical engineering* as the field of study.

Your career goal is the type of job where the typical career path is still starting at entry level and working up, maybe picking up a master's along the way to be eligible for upper management roles. One reason for that is that the skills and concepts you're learning in the grad programs will have limited overlap with the day-to-day of the job. It's actually common to have applications from people who are clearly smart, but who would need a lot of extra training relative someone less credentialed but more experienced in industry, because what they have been trained to do fits for academia but not for an office job. To that end, most businesses wouldn't know what to do with somebody who is this credentialed but has no or limited work experience.

I just wanted to call out these comments first just because they feel like there is a lot of underlying judgement, and possibly towards yourself. Procrastination is normal and you shouldn't feel any negativity towards wanting time to yourself every now and then. It only becomes an issue when it becomes chronic, and even then, it still isn't some kind of terrible personality trait because it is a product of underlying challenges. 
  
You are allowed to let yourself feel upset and to step away from your responsibilities to take care of yourself. The important caveat is that you bring awareness and non-judgement to how you manage whatever is challenging you.
  
I would absolutely recommend therapy based on your OP (therapy is never a bad idea, even if you feel like you don't need it). They can help you explore your thoughts and feelings, and really put a language to your experiences. It is a very empowering opportunity and can make sure you are equipped to be aware and non-judgy of how your mind is responding to the challenges around you.
  
The other thing I would suggest if you really don't want to do therapy right now is mindfulness meditation. The idea behind anxiety is that you are in a constant adrenaline rush thats triggered by stress. If the brain doesn't practice calming itself then it rewires itself to more efficiently operate in a stressed state and you end up just feeling stressed at a basal level. Mindfulness teaches your brain how to focus and observe your thoughts in a non-judgemental way so that you can give your brain the space to move on.

3) projects are also sometimes allocated by named personnel in grants.  So if person A is supported by grant A and B and C they do work on those projects.  If person X is supported by grant Y they do that one.

For instance, I have a trainee with a medical background and one with an engineering background- both great skillsets but totally different. They are going to fit with different projects, some might be further along than others, have different skills, and need different coaching from me. 

I say this because most of your distress seems to come from comparing to this other student. First, that just doesn't matter. Second, this will bring up huge red flags in running a lab, and I've seen many students get tossed from labs for petty behavior thinking things aren't fair. There can also be tons of other things going on with this trainee that you don't know about and don't need to know about, because they just don't impact you.

It is also incredibly difficult to train new people due to rules on how many in a lab and how close together. So much of this is temporary. And in any time, that first year of a PhD is tough. I've seen so many students feel like they aren't doing anything or don't know what to do, again normal. So let's focus on what you need. Are you 100% ready to hit the ground running when your study can start up? If not, those skills or organizational things (participant recruitment materials, writing code, anything else you'd need) are what you work on now. If you need training in an area, bring that up. And reading is 100% an appropriate thing to do right now! 

It doesn't sound like your PI has really done anything wrong here. But working with them on a timeline might be helpful. Or say things like ""I'd really like to get involved with X, or learn Y skill, are their any opportunities for me to do so?"" can be helpful. DO NOT SAY ""SALLY GETS TO DO THIS AND I DON""T!"" That is not a mature or effective way of handing things. Remember that your PI is also under insane stress, and they need to get whatever they can get done in these hard times done, so they are going to go with the sure bet. Do not add to their stress with interpersonal issues. And you need to show they that you are mature and can handle things. Right now there are some red flags. 

Mental health should 100% be taken seriously. Do not just blame your distress on the situation, you need to address your mental health as it relates to you before you can take anyone on.",1,2021-02-20 14:24:50

Also (sounds obvious) but do something you love! It makes it so much easier to self motivate. I've met a lot of PhDs that slog through 4 years because they think the topic is important but the people that are genuinely excited by the area seem to happiest!

Third, as a BIPOC researching “hard” science (neuro) you have tons of exclusive opportunities for fellowships and grants. While this may be somewhat true in all disciplines, medically-relevant “hard” science has the most funding opportunities overall.

This is about a manager dealing with this exact dilemma. How you do contribute to the destigmatization of mental health issues, without oversharing? Read the comments for a variety of perspectives, but a general consensus that while mental health issues can be an explanation, they cannot be an excuse.

This article talks about how ""being professional"" means maintaining a relatively even keel, and not letting a bad day or bad mood significantly impact how you interact with people.

\#1 here talks about how sharing feelings isn't great in the workplace. While this is about mandatory sharing of feelings, it shares similar dynamics to regularly sharing the state of your emotional health -- not really appropriate for the workplace because it shifts the burden of managing your feelings and emotions onto others.

I think it's good to be aware that students see you as having ""mean days"" and nicer days, and think about what it is that you do differently during these different kinds of days. Try to find what's working well on the nicer days and do more of it. And try to find out what the connection is between you having a down day and coming across, to your students, as mean, and seek to stop those kinds of actions before they happen. (They may be subtle things! You might even, at some point, consider taping a few class sessions--all the easier if you are teaching remotely on Zoom right now.)

I do not think it makes sense to give a daily announcement of your emotional state. As another commenter remarked, this is essentially asking your students to manage or respond to your emotional state. If I were a student, I would feel some sense of slightly nervous anticipation wondering whether today my professor was going to say they were in a good mood or a bad mood. And I'd feel a bit on edge if they said they were in a bad mood.

That said, I do think it's good to convey your self-awareness to students in a way that is appropriate. If you're having a particularly rough day, it's fine to start class by saying ""Hey students, I'm finding that today is a difficult day for me. Each day I do my best to be present with you when I teach, and I'll continue to do that today, but my best today might not be the same as my best on other days. Know that I'll be flexible with you, too, if you're having an off-day."" An announcement like that, if it's once, maybe twice in a semester, shows self-awareness and humanizes you. But if you were making such an announcement, say, once a week, then it would feel like a lot for students to manage.

It is also essential for your mental health as academia is often quite lonely and stressful as is. The effect of a prestigious university is not negligible; however, so it depends entirely on what your end goal is: academia or industry.

The problem was not the XX expected hours spent in lab but that it didnt correlate with success (despite ivy league place and well known lab). We had a lot of mental health issues and one attempted suicide (persons stopped eating for weeks and stopped sleeping towards the end so he could work harder). You could easily work 14h a day, but there was no point as you could get moved from your first authorship to mid-author because the PI wanted an undergrad as first author so the PI would look good in the department. Threats were for visa/GC typically or not getting a refence letter ie destroying your career. People that tried for TT and  made it to the interview after 50-100 applications, they found out the PI had written a shitty letter. And as the PI knew they were on the market they became ""technicians"" in the lab. 

It was a lot of uneccessary hard work because we had to re-invent the wheel constantly. For example the PI would hire a post doc with no  experience for the given project sometimes the equipment is in another location too...the post doc was promised a great learning experience,then arrives to the lab to start the project but there is no training and he has to set up everything on his own within 3 months or the circus starts. Sometimes the data produced by the stressed post doc wont even make sense, because the person has not established the technique and years are spent on the project until new post doc takes over and has to spend time cleaning up and then re-inventing the wheel.

 In summary, you work hard, your publication record is 1 paper/year in Impact 5-10 journal, you wont get a reference letter for a TT and probably cant even compete with your publication record ...The PI has been reported XX times but used to have 5 R01  (now maybe down to 3-4) and start ups so Department would not touch him.

*Truly* abusive professors are reprehensible.

glkw522,t3_l9uhqo,True,goatsnboots,t2_rswxz,"Yes! I do! This question was made for me.


I have been tracking every minute since the start of my PhD two years ago. Note that my contract states 35 hours a week, and this means 35 hours sitting at my desk available to work. I also started off using the pomodoro technique, but even if I stuck to that religiously, I'd only actually work 5:50 a day. Then you factor in some longer bathroom breaks, chats with coworkers, waiting for meetings to start, etc. and my median work hours per day for the past two years are 4:25. Pretty bad. 


That being said, look at my days without pomodoro and it's a pretty wide mix. There were days that I sat at my desk for 7 hours and did 2 hours of work because I was so unmotivated (I should also note that attendance is pretty strict here, otherwise I would have just taken that as a mental health day). There are of course some days that I worked longer. My record is 12:42 one day, doing actual work. That was during a 3-week period where I think I was pulling off 60-70 hours a week before a deadline. Obviously, I did not do pomodoro those weeks. 


The bottom line is work the way that's best for you. Sure, pomodoro means that you'll work a little less. But working 4 hours a day with pomodoro is better than 2 hours a day without. Also, don't limit yourself to that system. If your alarm goes off and you don't feel like you need to take a break, do that.


Also, for what it's worth, everyone who doesn't track their time inflates their hours. I have a colleague who complains about working until 10pm or midnight every day. And I guarantee I work more than he does in my 7-hour shift. He might be physically at the office for 11 hours, but I see him at his desk maybe 2 hours before I go home. Some people need to move around a lot and take lots of long breaks, which is okay too, but know when you might need to fix that in order to be productive.

I knew I always wanted to be a scientist ever since middle school, I was fascinated by the prospect of discovering something new and learning how the universe worked. My father was a scientist and professor (different field from mine) and I was always fascinated. 

However, life had a few other plans. During my graduate school years I had mental health issues and I could not deal with the isolation and culture shock that came with being in a new country. I got my masters and left, took nearly a year off to recover. Decided to get into biotech/ industry. I’ve been in a few biotech and government jobs and although I love the work life balance, I have more free time to pursue my hobbies etc, get paid a reasonable wage, I have realized I very badly miss research. 

I miss being the in the lab, doing experiments that lead to pieces of a puzzle. I miss the intellectual freedom to pursue literally whatever I like and follow where the research goes. I miss the collaborative and open nature of academic science. I strongly feel that’s where I need to be, and something big is missing from my life. I’m hesitant because the path to a tenure track position is uncertain and difficult but if I don’t at least try my best I will regret it. 

I plan on applying to PhD programs again after working in industry for about 4 years and a total break from academia for about 5 years. I actually feel like this experience and perspective will help me do better this time.

gt6jlg8,t3_mg33lt,True,roseofjuly,t2_oeiny,"Well, first, I would counsel you that there is no ""wrong"" decision. I don't think there's any such thing as a pre-destined path that is your ""correct"" career - there are probably a variety of careers that you would derive varying levels of satisfaction and contentment from. It's possible, for example, that you would be *equally* happy doing medicine and academic research. Also, from a practical standpoint, there's no reason you can't switch: you can do a post-bacc and realize that medicine isn't for you, then do a PhD; or you could do the MA and realize you should've gone to med school, then do that instead. I've seen people do *both*. Or you can get an MD and then do a postdoctoral fellowship and go into research.

That said, how I knew I wanted to do academic research (or research in general) vs. clinical practice was thinking about what I wanted to do every day and what level of impact I wanted to make. I did not want to talk to clients/patients every day, and I did not really want to spend my days helping people with their individual-level medical/mental health issues. I wanted to spend my time thinking about *ecological level* health issues, and spend my mental energies trying to solve problems for entire populations of people. I like writing and reading and statistics, and I wanted to spend my days immersed in those things rather than every day practice.

Here's the thing, though: both of those careers offer you the flexibility to do both clinical practice and research, depending on how you arrange your time and pursue your degrees. There are lots of MDs and clinical psychologists who balance clinical practice and research. So I'd really pick the field that has the approach that you want to take towards research and practice. Clinical psychology and psychiatry have *very* different approaches towards mental health science and treatment.",1,2021-04-02 21:18:16

In my case my advisor reacted fairly positively when I eventually talked to him, but once I talked to him it was immediately obvious that things would've gone so much more smoothly if I had talked to him much earlier on.

I think there's a strong possibility that your mental health issues are coloring the way you view this situation. 

First, your chair is not trying to ""trap"" you into anything -- she is in fact providing you with very concrete, practical life advice. Your supervisor is doing you a favor. There are all sorts of obvious reasons why you should not let your work supervisors and mentors know you are planning to leave or even considering leaving your career until you are walking out the door, and I assure you that academia is not unique in this regard. If you cannot figure out what these are, well ... 

Second, no one is going to do anything more to ""rope"" you into staying or prevent you from ""untangling"" yourself than say, ""Geez, sorry to hear that, we'll really miss you!"" and immediately cut your funding / health insurance / etc. I think that if you try to read this from your advisor's perspective, it might look like you are the one trying to **en**tangle her in a nonprofessional relationship that does not respect her boundaries.",1,2021-03-30 21:45:54

Not saying it's right, because I agree 100% with you - their focus should have been on your mental health, making sure you're feeling safe and supported. And maybe asking what factors actually informed your decision, hello. Also, it was *kinder* of you to let them know now so they can factor it into departmental decisions.

I also remember the middle two years of my doctoral program as a dark memory hole - not much besides despair and agitation and painful insomnia. Ugh, I'm anxious just remembering them.

That said, I did really well on my comprehensive exams, and things got much better in years five and six, once I figured out how to order my life, got myself back into therapy, and got to work on my dissertation.

In my case, my lab also lost funding right after I got back from surgery, and then COVID happened like 6 months later. 

I took another post-doc to avoid an an employment gap (because maintaining continuous health insurance is now critical), but this whole chain of events has largely closed the door on an academic career for me. I'm from a working class family who can't financially support me, and I have student loan debt, so I can't justify the risk of trying to play the academic lottery when so few stable academic research positions exist and the competition is greater than ever.

If it's cancer, then to be honest, it's probably going to radically affect your life. When you're living in the shadow of a terminal illness, it casts a lot of things in very different lights. I was top of my class in grad school and passionate about my research before I had cancer. Now, I don't care about it at all. I know that it's unlikely to benefit anyone but publishing companies, and I feel like the time that I've put into science and the hobbies and relationships that I've lost in my pursuit of an academic research career were all just sacrifices on an alter of vanity.

 I'd rather spend my time with people that I care about and having fun instead of working all the time on shit that won't benefit me. Maybe you're different, but I know that this was not the outcome that I expected for myself at all.",1,2021-03-12 02:28:31

I don't have direct experience with the non-lab based positions in the industry as much. I work closely with many of them for things like clinical safety feedback, regulatory communications, toxicology, project managers, external business development, legal, etc. There are many different avenues into the industry that don't require lab work.

I can't speak as to what is expected or regular for the non-lab positions. However, in my area of Biologics Process Development a PhD would be required to eventually reach the salaries you have listed. For reference, with a PhD, I just started a new position in the past couple months that brings my salary (including bonus) up to ~135k. As I have worked longer in the job, the amount of time I have spent in the lab has decreased as I have taken on more management roles, managing the research associates (BS &amp; MS positions) that actually carry out many of the studies that I have designed and manage. For example, in the past three months, I have only been in the lab a handful of days as the work that needs to be done is being handled by a combination of our contract manufacturer and a couple of our research associates.

In general, I would only suggest a PhD if you are sure about it. /r/gradschool is littered with posts about the mental health toll that a PhD program takes on grad students. I have helped several of my grad school colleagues out with getting jobs in the industry. The first job you get is always going to be the hardest. Once you are in the industry, it is much easier to move around within that bubble and all the companies I have worked for encourage people to explore moves to other departments inside the company. This is a way for these companies to retain talent even if their current position isn't a great fit, as that is really the limiting factor in a very concentrated area like the Boston area.

I'm also a master's student in Physics from India. I get where you're coming from.   


I would suggest finishing your MSc and maybe working for a year or so, in a related area. I know that post an MSc you can apply to be a scientific officer in Government institutions and labs and such. BARC, ONGC and other places come to mind. Maybe take a year to do this and see how you feel. It would certainly reduce the kind of stress you're feeling while trying to study, but also keep you occupied and in touch with what you've studied, atleast relative to a job in a completely different area. At the end of the year, you can take the entrance exams again, if you so wish to. Alternatively you could just take a year off after the MSc to figure out how you want to go forward. Maybe you can even prepare for the entrances then.   


In either case, I would suggest seeking help from a mental health professional. Your university might already offer people (although knowing India this is likely either absent or just bad). From personal experience, it is very difficult to focus and/or study when your mind is racing and the anxious thoughts don't stop. And because you can't study the thoughts get worse. It is important to break this vicious cycle. Maybe try picking up an unrelated hobby and set aside time where you are not going to study and just going to do something to relax.",1,2021-03-09 07:38:31

Read for pleasure. You'd be surprised what can inspire you. And if you burn out on academic writings, you run the risk of not being able to force yourself to read something important when you need to.

Take time to recharge. Whatever self care is for you, do it. You'll need it.

Take the free time to get into a healthy routine. Balance is a huge challenge in grad school; having a routine of sleeping 8 hours a night, exercising, stretching (avoid that student posture!), resting your eyes periodically, cooking healthy meals, etc that you continue into the more stressful periods of your graduate career will be immeasurably beneficial. 

Similarly, start taking a multivitamin. You wouldn't believe how much more energy and mental clarity you can get from nutritional balance. 


Find a therapist. This one was already said, but worth repeating. Do it now. Trust me. 

Take time to see/talk to friends. Don't neglect your friendships, both with labmates and non-grad school friends. This will help you recharge and will ensure you have strong friendships waiting waiting in the wings for that first (and fiftieth) grad school meltdown. 

All of these practices will make you a healthier, more balanced person. And, contrary to popular media, health and balance are beneficial to being a scientist. *(Obviously getting nutrients from your diet is preferable, but not realistic for most people.)*",1,2021-03-09 04:13:56

eubur7m,t1_euasu4r,True,NTGuardian,t2_10is70,"A cheap shot would be to say that Normal random variables have no minimum or maximum so since there is a minimum or maximum grade, grades cannot be Normally distributed. This is a cheap shot because lots of phenomena that's effectively bounded this way are fit to Normal distributions and no one bats an eye since the probability of being that far away from the mean is vanishingly small (albeit non-zero). However it could matter to grades since a larger standard deviation in grades and clumping of grades near the higher end of the distribution could mean that the probability of seeing an impossibly high grade is higher than tolerable if the grades were modeled with a Normal random variable.

Next we should agree the the objective of grades is to measure students' understanding and competency, with an ""A"" grade meaning ""This student has mastered the material"" and an ""F"" meaning ""This student is not competent in the material"", which ranges anywhere from the student knowing something about the material but not enough to the student basically knowing nothing at all about the material. If the class size is somewhat small, it will be hard to see a Normal distribution naturally arise due to the natural fluctuation of students' innate ability. It's easier for instructors to get ""smart"" classes where the students overall are above-average, and also to get classes where the students are not like that. Part of this is just randomness, part is associated with semester and time of day. But there should be some natural variation due to random sampling that can make natural grades not look exactly Normal with some specified mean and variance. This could be less of a problem for ""jumbo"" classes, though.

Now let's talk about grading. There's likely some scheme that awards points to students based on their performance. These schemes are never perfect and always arbitrary but there's generally some truth in the resulting numbers. Some people say that grading this way produces bimodal distributions, suggesting there's clumps of students that either do or do not get the material. I often observe left-skewed distributions, where most students range between mediocre to good, some are great, and some are *catastrophically bad*. Neither of these are features of Normal distributions.

So to get a Normal distribution one would have to take grading based off of points then determine each student's percentile in the class and then see what the corresponding grade would be for the respective percentiles if grades were actually Normally distributed.

Two things: first, this produces a distortion in how points work. You get non-linear benefits for points scored on anything, from homework to quizzes to tests. Specifically, it's possible for the third point to be more valuable to your grade than the second point, and the second less valuable than the first. This is technically already true since grades are generally thresholds, but each point has an equal contribution (withing their own assignment) to reaching a particular threshold. This will not be the case if grades are curved. Students are going to struggle to understand and appreciate that.

Second: when you're doing this, the Normal distribution actually doesn't matter. You're effectively assigning grades based on percentiles, not Normal percentiles specifically. You could make the grades fit any distribution you want this way, from Normal to uniform to beta to Cauchy to exponential and so on forever. You're just saying that the lowest 20% will get Fs and the highest 20% will get A's (or the lowest 5% will get Fs and the highest 5% will get As, if you're actually sticking to a Normal distribution). But you're putting artificial distance between, say, the students at the top; two top students could have mastered the material but one got an extra point because of luck, yet her grade will look *much* better than the other stellar student. This is because of how tails work in the Normal distribution. In fact, if students at the top figured this out, they'd start obsessing over every single point because every point would have a big impact on their grade, which would be bad for their learning and mental health.

So summing up (or **tl;dr**): aside from being literally impossible, natural student grades don't look like they're Normally distributed; they have statistical features Normal random variables don't exhibit, and there should be natural variation in scores. When you force grades to follow a Normal distribution, you must distort the value of points and in the end are just grading based off of percentiles, which doesn't seem fair.",3,2019-07-20 21:18:50

In short, yes, it is way worse than in the US in terms of job availability. Realistically, *you will not get the job unless you are a Canadian citizen or permanent resident prior to your application.* This is because Canadian universities are state-run and therefore strictly must make a strong case that there is not an equally-qualified candidate among the Canadian talent pool if they are going to sponsor you for a work permit. You're probably not going to qualify for permanent residency express entry without a few years of domestic work experience under your belt either, so realistically this is a challenge if you want to aim for a TT position.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as discrimination, it depends what you mean by discrimination. There are really good benefits associated with maternity, decent mental health support, decent disability protection, etc. Work hours and flexibility are going to be essentially the same as any TT job in the US or Europe. Health case is public and paid for by taxes; you can get insurance through university employers which will cover dental, mental health care, prescriptions, etc., but heath care in general is public. This is obviously not the case in the US. There is currently a major push to hire diversely, which includes women candidates and candidates from ethnic minorities; this seems to apply in the US as well.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the big issue with hiring (aside from the challenges associated with landing a job if you are not a citizen/PR) is that there just are not a lot of jobs in Canada. There are maybe a dozen major research institutions in the entire country, and some smaller community college style schools, but there just isn't the same sort of abundant private school and SLAC culture you have in the US. Schools are essentially all public at the provincial level and funded by a combination of provincial taxes and relatively low tuition. Many courses end up being taught by adjunct faculty because there simply isn't budget allocation at the state level to pay for faculty and because tuition rates are legally frozen at the provincial level. Additionally there is a whole class of postdoctoral fellow in Canada, the Banting Fellowships, which serve to transition a postdoc into a professorship role; these fellowships generally transition seamlessly into professorships without an open search. So, most of the actual hires at the TT level don't happen through open searches.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, it's a decent system if you are in the top 10% of your field AND are a Canadian citizen/PR AND have the time to wait around for the job to open up AND are eligible/competitive for a Banting or are willing to adjunct it up at an institution for years on soft money. But if you're not Canadian and don't come from within the Canadian system? You really need to be the best in your field to have a shot.",7,2019-07-12 13:57:27

Work hours and culture will differ between countries. The two countries also have vastly different healthcare systems; i don't know what that means to you, but you will have to decide for yourself. As it goes, IME, grad students have very good health care compared to average Americans, so I wouldn't necessarily equate pre-conceived notions about American health care with grad school health care.

The rest are things that are either likely shunned in both countries IME (mental illness issues) or are not really something I have found different from talking with grad students from Canadian undergraduates (like assistance for those with disabilities, or much non-cultural bias against woman).

Tips for finding a good masters program: pick a lab based on where you feel welcome and happy.

Think about what kind of job you’d like and look at whether you need the PhD to achieve that career. If you don’t absolutely need the PhD, it’s a huge commitment in terms of time, stress, and lost potential wages. So many people are ending up in jobs outside of academia because there aren’t enough spots for all of the new PhDs being produced. If you think that you’ll end up outside of academia, I’d think long and hard about whether to commit to the PhD.

As someone who’s in the biomedical sciences, here’s what my experience has been. My goal has been to stay in academia since I started doing research seven years ago, but I’m now about halfway through my PhD and am not sure if I should continue trying to pursue academia once I’m done. I knew intellectually what the pay situation would be like when I was in undergrad applying, but the reality of it is that being poor is REALLY stressful. I can make ends’ meet but I’m constantly terrified that if I have any big, unexpected expense, I’ll be totally fucked. I don’t know if I can do this for another five years or so as a postdoc while grinding my way towards an academic post that will most likely never materialize. I’m not able to put much money away for retirement at all right now, and the prospect of god knows how many more years of that absolutely terrifies me.

Right now, I have a truly wonderful mentor, I love the other students in my program, I love the work I get to do, and overall my situation as a grad student is pretty amazing. I absolutely love science, I love talking about it, I love thinking about it, and I love designing experiments to get answers to questions about how biological processes works.

I won award after award throughout my undergrad, won a scholarship to do my MA, received an unconditional offer for a PhD with a supervisor I respected to do a project I was passionate about. However, about 3 months before I found out I got a scholarship to do my PhD (it was 16k annual, so barely enough to live on, much less save and buy a house on), I was headhunted by an international company who offered me twice the scholarship and amazing benefits. I obviously took the job as I hadn't been sure I'd get the scholarship, and when I got the offer I agonised over the decision but I ended up turning it down as ultimately I felt it was the more responsible thing to do. Keeping the job with all its benefits was the 'safe bet', even though I feared I'd regret it.

It's been a few years now and I never have. Not once.

Everyone is different though, so here's what you need to think about. Will doing this PhD genuinely benefit your career and life? 

I know so many students who did a PhD cause they liked the lifestyle of academia and they had no plan-B outside of academia. Some did it just cause they were passionate about their subject and didn't want to let it out of their lives yet, and that's a valid reason for some people, but if you're in a precarious monetary position (and given how much uni in the US costs), is it the best option for you? I would only ever recommend doing a PhD to someone (who isn't independently wealthy) if they feel the net benefit outweighs the many, many, many serious costs to your time, mental health, physical health, and career aspirations (you will be 4 years behind people who went straight into the work force). 

I have never regretted 'leaving academia' and going private, but I was studying DH and ended up in IT, so I still do similar to things to what I did before, I still attend conferences, and I still am active in my former area of research as a hobby. I got the best of both worlds. Our situations may not line up, but hopefully it'll give you something to think about and let you know there is a happy path out there for you.

New boss was very sympathetic but went on with the project; it turned out the project crashed and burned because old boss wanted to micromanage everything there too! New boss came and asked me how to deal with him and didn’t get mad when I said “I told you so”. Old boss’s colleagues in the field drifted away from him as they realised the extent of his toxicity, and survivors groups popped up from his ex students and employees.

As someone who has received accommodations for a disability, I'd like to speak on behalf of a ""minority"" demographic that I'm sure populates this subreddit at significantly higher proportions than the general population.

There is a subgroup of people known in k-12 special-ed lingo as ""twice exceptional."" These are individuals who are both gifted and disabled-- who have extreme potential but tend to drastically under-perform.

Many of us grapple with both our potential and our limitations. The message that many individuals who are skeptical about the validity of accommodations send us is that it doesn't matter what we are capable of. If we have a bad day now and then, too bad.

Some of us have much to offer this world, but if I have a seizure (or some highly stigmatized mental health episode) during a high workload week, then it doesn't matter. I cannot share capabilities with the world. Just because my brain does not work on someone else's schedule.

Many people cannot grasp the concept of ""twice-exceptionality."" Either you're ""smart and capable"" or ""dumb and incompetent."" I once told a redditor that I had a professor (PhD in Math) who had a learning disability and the redditor accused me of lying, because ""people with learning disabilities can't graduate college.""

People are more complex than that. Most people just want to demonstrate their true capabilities, and for many, all it takes to do so is some flexibility or some extra time on a test.

I certainly do not condone reduced rigor of classes. But increased flexibility for individuals who are facing personal challenges? That's not reduced rigor-- that's allowing people to take time to tend to their very real health needs. The assignment will still be there when they get back (I assume you're not getting rid of assignments in their entirety-- just allowing them to be done on a time-table that is more convenient to students).

Reducing rigor would imply that you are decreasing standards for what constitutes ""A"" level work. The disability laws specifically state that this is something that you do not need to do, and if it something you are being pushed to do, I would give a nice nudge back in their direction (I understand the political pressures, but if you are genuinely being asked to lower standards, then that is a problem).

Remember, the laws that dictate you must be given accommodations in school are laws that apply in the ""real world"" too. A person cannot be fired for a disability unless it actually affects job performance. A person must be given reasonable accommodations.

More and more people are able to go to school and fulfill their true potential as a result of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I see this as nothing but a good thing.

Again, if you are actually reducing rigor, this is something you should push back on (if you can without getting yourself into too much hot water).

elw1o1l,t3_bhgvkv,True,grizzlouie,t2_3o5dx5ch,"Overall, I had a really good experience. I did my undergrad in a humanities, worked for a few years, and got a PhD in health sciences (US). First year - coursework, second year - written quals, third year - oral quals/proposal, fourth year - dissertation defense. I had solid funding throughout (first two years on fellowship, unsuccessful app for an external fellowship so funded third year by TA-ing, and fourth year got an internal fellowship) and a better than average relationship with my adviser. My adviser was very supportive and knowledgable, and after some time I figured out how to get our work styles to harmonize better. It's neat now to think about how that mentoring rapport improved over time - I had never had that experience before. I also worked in health services research role 50% time during my PhD and was able to use the data and some of the tasks for my graduate work - so that made it a lot more efficient and gave me an opportunity to publish more papers outside my dissertation. I entered with zero papers and finished with six, plus others that were under review or in progress. 

I definitely had mental health struggles, but they started when I was a child and were worse before grad school. I had such a hard time mentally/emotionally in college, and I thought it was because college was hard, and then my mental health got way worse when I was working. So the PhD didn't cause my mental health issues, but like any other job there would be times that mental illness got in the way of work/life. Having a goal (getting a PhD to be capable of doing interesting and impactful work to improve health) was a good impetus to really learn how to manage my mental illness. Did a lot of therapy and started meds, and honestly, having the incremental goals and progress really helped. Ultimately, all of those things, plus the relationships I was able to develop as a result of getting my shit together mentally, made grad school a markedly better time than anything I'd experienced before. Of course research and grad school is a roller coaster, and I'm delighted that I'm past it and more autonomous now, but it really was the best time of my life up until that point. It helped me a lot to think of it as a job, and it helped that I had some mileage with other jobs that were less meaningful or engaging to me so I had a reference for real strengths/weaknesses of grad school.",1,2019-04-27 03:44:57

I know it can seem hardest to continue when you're ""closest to the shore,"" so to speak, but if there's any chance at all you can finish, you should. Also, they're right that grad school is extremely stressful. You're going to be tired, stressed, anxious, and you're going to have family emergencies and losses that you'll have to power through, so if you can make it through this, it might be a good indicator of what you can make it through then.

Aft I drafted an outline for the main points I wanted to cover, then created slides for what I wanted to visualize. 

The actual defense was not at all as daunting as I imagined it though. The preperation is mostly for the introduction section of the defense/presentation. This is where you introduce who you are as a scholar. After the intro is a bunch of questions and answers. In my head, I treated the Q&amp;A like a conversation between scholars.

Also please pay attention to your physical and mental health. It is very important.

So far for the rational side of things. On the emotional side, please set up an appointment with your uni's mental health service. They can help you with what this is: failure anxiety. It's easy to feel like you should be suffering from something hugely bad to ""deserve"" that help, but that's one of the things your expensive tuition fees pay for. I've been there.

\- close to friends or family

I would encourage you to speak to your professor -perhaps they can be sure sure you are safe in class. But most importantly I would go right away to your school's Title IX or EEO (or EOC, if you PM me with your school name I could help you find the appropriate office) and file a report immediately. Actually if you talk to your prof they will have to report this anyway. Schools are required by federal law to prevent their students and employees from experiences like this. 

How are you feeling? If this is causing anxiety (which is totally understandable if it is) I would also go to your counseling center and start seeing a therapist for additional support. Other places you can get support: your Dean of Students,  the LGBTQ center, the Women's Center, or the Diversity/Inclusion office.

Second, if you have the capacity to get into an elite school and you go to a mediocre school, it's not going to stop you from succeeding, but it's going to make it harder. Your advisor is going to be a major factor, but people reading your CV are going to see your University first.

I think you are putting the cart before the horse here. You are putting a great deal of emphasis on min/maxing your career and 'climbing the ladder'. 

Having career goals is good, and it's important to have a vision for yourself - but I think there are some other questions that you should ask yourself. Where does your lifestyle factor into this? Where do you want to live? What kind of life do you want to have there? How does family factor into this? How does a partner fit into this? Do you want to have kids/family? How might they factor into these moves? 

Life isn't a race nor is the academy a tower you need to climb. I'm still fairly early career, but I've realised that there is no end to that - there is no point at which you think ""I did it"". If you set yourself up to chase the horizon now, you'll have a hard time ever getting out of that mentality. And its certainly not the best from a mental health perspective (have a look at the work of Richard Sennet if you are interested in this area). 

Look, you can view your career/life however you like- it's your prerogative but I would implore you to take a step back and look at your life more wholistically. There is so much more to life that grinding out academic levels. Absoluitely, have an OE - go work in the UK and do a PhD but be reflective and be open to not sticking to 'plan'.",-1,2019-06-09 00:10:18
eqdzfac,t3_by63j3,True,foibleShmoible,t2_i61ju,"I want to start off by saying that I am sorry that you've had all of this happening. I want to be very clear that I do sympathise with your situation, because I'm afraid that what I have to say is going to come across as harsh. To be clear, I don't think that you did anything wrong in how you attempted to handle the situation from your side, **but** I don't *necessarily* think your university did anything wrong either. So I'm going to try and show why from the university's perspective a grade bump isn't necessarily due.

&gt; I applied to have counselling at the university which was 6 sessions starting at the end of September 2018. **These 6 sessions didn’t have a major impact on my situation but they definitely helped.**

(Emphasis my own) This statement shows first off that the university has been supporting you this year. However the second sentence negates somewhat the point you tried to make about your lower second semester grades (""11.67% less than the previous semester where I received counselling and support."") You can't argue that counselling didn't have a major impact and then claim that without it you had a major drop in marks.

&gt; I arranged a meeting with the welfare officer again and told her my mental health is deteriorating... The welfare officer emailed the counselling service at the uni and asked for me to have urgent sessions because of my situation. I was offered a group mental health workshop a month~ later, which I could not attend 

Now you had a very good reason not to be able to attend, but that isn't the university/welfare officer/counselling services fault; you asked for support and they did make it available to you.

&gt; I contacted the welfare officer again saying I’m seriously struggling ... and that I had not heard back about counselling sessions but just received a generic response of maybe deferring or extending my modules for this semester. I asked whether my circumstances could be taken into consideration when marking my assignments and she said the university doesn’t do that. So I go and get extensions on my modules for this semester. This wasn’t a good idea, without much support it was just extra time for me to struggle with.

&gt; In May I was called by the counselling service and was offered sessions, 3 months after requesting them and that’s 3 months of not much support from the university other than maybe extend or defer, dealing with my family issues and my own mental health - lonely times. I had moved back home shortly before this as I was not receiving support and thought being home would help, so I couldn’t accept the sessions but also this was after lectures had ended and it was just deadlines.

You had previously had extensions and you accepted them this time, and that is a pretty standard form of support for students with extenuating circumstances like yours. It is unfortunate that the offered sessions came 3 months down the line, but again you had been offered a group session (that you had, I acknowledge, been unable to attend) and since the sessions were offered before your extended deadlines there was arguably time for them to help you prior to submitting your final assignments. Again, it is not the university or counselling service's fault that you had already moved home.

&gt; After seeing this I checked the university policy and it states that if a student has circumstances which affect their academic performance, it could be requested to be considered during marking of assignments, with **potentially a different marking system in place**. Whereas the welfare officer said the university doesn’t do this.
It states that appeals can be made if academic performance has been affected by circumstances of the student that are unknown to the marker and results are lower than expected.

(Emphasis my own) Your welfare officer might have been incorrect previously, or they might have known that *in your particular circumstances* a different marking system would not have been used. IMO/IME, one might expect extensions *or* marking adjustments in your circumstances, but not really both, and you'd already had the former.

I also have to agree with u/another_secret_prof on this point:
&gt; nobody knows what you would have achieved without these problems.

First off, it is entirely possible that your final semester courses were harder than the ones previously. Secondly, a person's grades can fluctuate at any time. (During my own degree I had a 30% fluctuation between my highest and lowest marks.) Especially since your *mean* for second semester was 53, implying that on some assignments you did better than that, surely?

---------------------------------------------------------

To conclude (because that was a wall of text), I do believe that the university took reasonable steps to accommodate you. Were the accommodations perfect? Probably not. But that is not for a lack of trying. There is no way to know exactly what will work for every person, but they offered you both extensions and counselling support (which you were not always able to take up, for legitimate reasons, but that is not their fault), and you have no way to *prove* that you would have scored higher under different circumstances.

By all means, appeal if you want, you have nothing to lose. But I honestly think they took reasonable steps to accommodate you in very difficult circumstances. Best of luck, and I hope that things improve for you moving forwards.",4,2019-06-08 12:33:31

eorzcnh,t3_bsxc1h,True,Sound_and_Science,t2_3rlrk25i,"I've really struggled with something very similar. I absolutely love writing (worked as a copy editor in college and picked up a fiction-writing hobby in grad school partly as a way to cope with stress). However, every single time I've had major academic writing projects they've been associated with pretty serious mental health episodes (Panic attacks, worsening of OCD compulsions, and serious burnout). YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT ALONE.

I have to admit to also worrying about whether I'm compatible with a long-term career in academia, so I can't be of much help there. But I can share some of the coping strategies that have at least gotten me through my PhD program so far:

\- Most Universities offer some form of therapy/counseling services for students. There's a reason for that. I think everyone struggles with mental health issues of one form or another, but graduate school has a way of taking low-lying issues and ramping them up until your brain is basically on fire. Use this resource proactively, and work with a professional to understand why you react the way you do and develop specific strategies to deal with it. 

\- Try to ignore deadlines. By which I mean: start early enough with a regular schedule that you can focus on writing and not the impending doom of ""the thing"" (whatever it is) being due. If you can set aside just half an hour a day early on to commit to writing, you'll get yourself in the routine of sitting down and generating words. You'll probably have to scale that up to longer and more frequent writing sessions at some point, but that way you have a ""functional writing unit system"" that you're comfortable with by the deadline pressure really sets in (see also the Pomodoro method)

\- As much as we all know it, but it's hard to truly internalize: Done is better than perfect.

\- I've personally found that the really technical parts of academic writing (methods, figure legends, even results sections) are the things I struggle most with, whereas things that are arguably harder to write (introduction and discussion sections) come much easier. This is the opposite of what a lot of my lab-mates have told me. I think it's because there's just a little more room for the creativity (dare I say artistry? Is there room for that in academia?) that I enjoy as part of writing, and so I have more fun writing them. If you can find any way to tap into that when you get to those sections, it may help. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope that helps. I promise it is do-able, and while unfortunately I don't have a way of truly eliminating all the stress and anxiety of academic writing, I have found effective ways to get it done anyway.

eoia9m0,t3_bs10d9,True,throwaway_4569420,t2_3nruusfa,"I joined a phd program in 2016 but left 6 months in after I realized that the team including my supervisor was extremely toxic (compared to all of the academics I interacted with during my masters and bachelors degrees in the UK and in Australia). At the time when I left the funded placement I knew I was doing the right thing for myself because working/adapting to work in such a toxic environment should not be the norm. I was worried that saying anything bad about him might make him kill a publication where I was second author which had already been submitted. I was also worried that he would ruin my reputation (he is a petty nutcase) and paint me out to be a liar and a thief, and destroy my chances of any future phd applications. So I didn't say any of the things that were on my mind (similar things to what you have described) and those things ate away at me slowly. I couldn't sleep properly for 6-7 months after and most waking moments were spent on negative thoughts that crippled my productivity. 

Anyway, I got the publication, and my previous academic referees (from the same university/department) gave me good references which enabled me to get three fully funded phd offers from mid tier universities in USA.  I even wrote a lengthy email to my supervisor (which took a lot of fucking effort) thanking him for all of the good things he did in those 6 months: nominated me for scholarship, pushed me to publish, encouraged me to be critical, and even told me to get mental health assistance during the last few weeks. 

My point is this. You might have a unique insight into your supervisors personality now that you are working closely with him. However your perspective is probably heavy biased against him because he is making your life quite challenging (possibly because he wants to push you to be better). Try to end things as professionally as possible and reflect on how you were able to grow as a person during this testing time. Focus on the positives, and please talk to close friends/family or a counselor. I really hope you will be able to get back to your best self soon and have the courage to tackle this problem again.",3,2019-05-23 12:33:59

eo8ofab,t3_bqv03a,True,tchomptchomp,t2_6x557,"A few things.

&amp;#x200B;

First, you need to check both your offer letter and your TA contract. Does your offer letter guarantee you a certain number of TAships? Then that's legally binding. Does your TA contract clearly specify your role and are you being castigated for not finishing things well outside your clearly specified role? If so, then they can't legally terminate that position either. If your university has a unionized grad student organization, you need to bring all this with supporting communication to your union rep.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, check your offer letter because most offer letters guarantee you a stipend per annum. You should not have to worry about finances because of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Third, this may be more political than you think and may have little to do with you. As you said, the department head and the professors who are upset with you are not from your subfield. For all you know, there are other motivations here (e.g. freeing up TAships so they can take their own students off their grants, infighting between subfields, efforts to add material to courses without paying for more TA hours). You need to take this all less personally because it may not be personal at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Take the RA and focus on your research. You'll find that you'll get a lot more done when you're not spending 30 hours a week on TAship that's paying you for 15-20 hours a week. Do good research, publish it in good journals, and ignore this dumb drama. Take some of the extra time you free up and put it towards yourself and your mental health.

eyliaed,t3_cxhjrh,True,Euthyphraud,t2_3j3nnf86,"Your students will be more diverse in terms of the degree to which they care about the course, how serious they take it, how much they read, and the knowledge they bring with them aside from the material. You'll have freshmen from school districts that were awful and who may be bright, but know far less than you might expect. You'll have seniors who are obsessed with the topic and way ahead of the material. You have to provide definitions, explain things clearly - *and incorporate examples, humorous anecdotes, etc. -* it isn't as easy to hold undergrad's attention, especially in prereq courses that draw lots of non-majors. 

Also, things have changed considerably - it used to be that professors were very aloof, not providing personal opinions (matters more in social sciences/humanities). Today, your views are a google search away. Honesty goes a long way - you can be open, but be clear that you don't let biases interfere with grading and ask students to talk to you if they feel you aren't being fair. The more you make yourself accessible, human and reasonable in how you treat them the better - students very much want professors to see them as individuals, and may want to share things (and need to - there are now more legal obligations to report and help with mental health issues and to work with disability centers than 15 years ago!). You aren't there to be their friend, but be friendly. If you have a student who wants to chew up an hour of your office hours talking about topics in the field, school, careers and personal anecdotes don't discourage it (so long as it isn't keeping others from getting time). 

I suggest watching for struggling students - have an early quiz requiring them to learn a lot of basic definitions and ideas on their own and send emails to those who get C's or less. Email a student who fails to meet an important essay deadline, but has been doing well - *and be willing to accept late assignments.* 

I actually lie on my syllabi - I don't keep students to deadlines or deduct from them for being a bit late nearly as much as I threaten. This discourages those who may just want to do it to procrastinate, but allows those who have real life problems get a chance to still do well. 

I've had students just give up because they miss an important deadline due to some tragic event in their life, and they don't say anything - there are students, good ones, who will fail out because a family member dies or they come down with an illness that is uncomfortable to talk about.

It actually is a fun time - you can get to know undergrads better and be yourself more. Put your own touch and be more casual - professionalism is not as well-respected or admired by students as it was 15 years ago. Students want authenticity - they know you are just human but will respect your knowledge and expertise. They have a lot going on in their lives, and you have more opportunities to connect with them and help them in ways that matter beyond just the content of your class - if you care enough to.

The biggest *negative* is the use of laptops and phones. It is virtually impossible to ban laptops anymore - I always loved getting a room in a basement that didn't have reliable wireless! You can try, but you'll get lots of people with medical reasons, or who really give sympathetic reasons to allow their use - remember these students didn't learn cursive, they learned typing. This means - Facebook, Instagram, games, etc. You have to figure out how to reign that in, and the room, class, and circumstances at your institution will do that.

Phones are the worst. Students will continually use them, even with a ban - and you have to decide how hard to crack down. I tell students if they have to text or are expecting a very important message or call, to excuse themselves when it arrives - and to sit near the door.

Students will fact check you in real time. They'll look up what you're talking about - don't embellish!

Students expect notes with the powerpoints available - often before class - you don't have to comply, but it'll impact your teaching reviews.

Students will use laptops for class, though - honestly - they do take notes, they look up things related to the topic and get more interested - and when I've tried to remember something or I tell them something that seems ludicrous and say 'look it up' - it's fun to have students immediately confirming or providing additional information!

It's a much more 'dialectical' era - you're an educator and you have more responsibilities to the students - and they will seek advice on personal issues. You'll need to decide how comfortable you are, but its okay to show interest in their lives and ask about things.

Also, I have chatted with more than 50 Ph.D. students in STEM and I would say that half of them regularly go to therapy (individual or group) and at least another quarter of them have gone at least one and found it helpful. 

I have also chatted with advisors, many of whom said if they had only known sooner that their students were having trouble (academic, mental health, family, etc.) then they could have worked with them to help either make continuation in the program easier, or helping them transition to a job in industry. You know your advisor better than us, are they the type to react badly and retaliate?  Also, to address one of your concerns, most of the time, your funding and health insurance are signed on a yearly contract provided you are full time, they legally cannot pull it mid-term.

eyjcmfj,t1_eyi0yn7,True,Euthyphraud,t2_3j3nnf86,"I've run into this with other professors, and admittedly a few times with own students. To be honest, if you have this issues as you do then you ought to stop and consider how your 'calm terms' are received. I know professors who can be very calm, and come off unbelievably rude - they aren't mutually exclusive. 

I have noticed a shift in recent years; this new generation, now with the first students born after 9/11, is very different. Studies indicate, and my own experience supports, that students now are far more emotionally attuned - there is an expectation of empathy and understanding. There is a universal need to be accepted as individuals - not hard to understand why given the social media the world has provided them. It's the first generation that began school after Columbine, who are more familiar with 'active shooter drills' than tornado drills or fire drills.

It is a generation, among which include your youngest batches of *newly minted PhDs -* who are far more affected by mental health problems such as severe anxiety, panic attacks, PTSD. They are more insecure, more affected by media and less certain of who to believe or trust. You need them to trust you. 

It sounds more to me - and this is, again, internet advice so no ill will is meant here - that you are the one becoming less in tune with the times. The younger generations always supplant the old, and there are many new professors younger than I who are even more focused on empathy, inclusivity, diversity training and more - and that means talking about 'feelings'. It used to be professors were an unknown, without opinions - today all our opinions are a google search away. You have to - or are now expected to - be more open about yourself and more willing to hear students out and talk to them about things that weren't always expected of professors. When I began teaching over a decade ago it was still expected that you were to never have discussions about personal issues - today, you won't be viewed by student's as a good professor (or by people such as myself...) if you don't. I personally have had two students I've helped intervene on because of suicidal tendencies - and who ended up thanking me enough to allay any fear I had that I had overly intruded - with one contacting me later saying I was the only professor who cared and that I personally saved their life by intervening. 

That's the role we have in a classroom of very young adults-in-training. Remember, some of your students are going to be as young as 16 or 17! Their lives are more complicated than ours at that age - the world isn't the same. Being a professor is being an educator; being an educator means educating a person - making them better, more aware, think more critically - and they can't do it if brushed aside.

If you have somewhere to be, kindly tell the student you really wish you could talk now but you *have* to go - and to *please* email you and also consider coming by office hours (or - you know - another issue here, students don't come to office hours as much as they used to - but if you make yourself somewhat more available via an online 'facetime' thing-like app (I still don't understand technology!) many more will.

It's the professor's duty to keep up with the times - not just in terms of the literature, but in terms of the culture of those they charged with educating. And to adapt to that, and be there as mentors and educators - not as researchers who also have to teach and weren't given enough TAs.",1,2019-08-29 22:11:28
eyeb9qt,t3_cwrpuc,True,nuclearslurpee,t2_11caye,"Any of these are viable options depending on what approach you want to take, although the first one does sound iffy the way you put it.

1. You *can* make this work, but you need to sit down and soberly assess the effects on your mental and emotional health, short and long-term. Usually, the way people cope with a shitty job is by putting in minimum effort, putting on a fake smile when the Karens come in, and spending their other 128 hours in a week pursuing interests, a social life, and other things that make them happy. Assess how viable it is for you to live this way, at least until you can complete the work. One one hand, are the social and interest opportunities available for you, even if you have to work to find them? On the other hand, can you handle doing the minimum at work - both personally, and in terms of your long-term career plans? Honestly, with the shape of your lab as you describe it this sound iffy at best to me, but you would know better than I.

2. This is probably the best approach if you still hold out hope for an academic career. A new lab environment may help motivate you not only to put in the effort needed to really boost your CV for those faculty jobs, but also to feel like academia is a good career for you. Staying at your current lab is likely to kill that dream, honestly. If the funding is transferable, there shouldn't be a problem.

3. If you're quite sure that you would rather leave academia, this is your best option. **It is okay to turn down the grant funding.** It may not be a usual step, but circumstances do change and it's not unheard of. The funding agency may not be happy about this, but again - if you're planning to leave academia, tough patooties for them.

* Create a detailed weekly schedule, including exercise, and stick to it. Forget about “I feel like doing x” and think “it’s time to do x.” I had similar issues and removing what I feel like from the equation was hard but worth it. 

* Make sure to write one or two pages per week for every class with papers. Write as you research. 

* Always start with an outline. And work on whatever part of the paper your most interested in that day. Don’t write linearly. 

* Do first what you want to do the least. Whether is reading for a class or going shopping or hitting the gym. Whatever you’re dreading, just start the day with. Once that’s done the day will be better and you’ll have shown yourself you can accomplish tasks. 

* Have a bedtime. Some professors will tell you that during grad school they spent days without sleeping. Ignore them. Health first. Also, eat well and don’t drink too much. 

* Develop a career goal (or two) and visualize the path to it. See your career as a series of stages and set up goal of what you want to achieve. 

* Avoid drama. Dramatic people will drain your time and energy. And there are a lot of them in grad school. Some with the jaded ones that have been there for 20 years. 

* Read Mad at School, and understand emotional labor. Identify what gives you energy and which activities drain it. And get a therapist like yesterday. Grad school is going to be tough on your mental health.

This is one of the realities of academia (that I don't necessarily agree with).  A private and productive conversation with your PI is the best way to move forward, in my opinion. You can't publish these papers without your PI's permission because even though they didn't do any of the work, their funding is what paid for that work to be done (and for your efforts on that work), and they ""own"" it just as much as you do.   

&gt; Write everything down. 

Make sure you and your PI are on the same page about next steps, timeline to finish things by October, a timeline for projects that other collaborators may need to pick up after you leave, etc. After the meeting, put it in all in an email and send to your PI with something like ""just wanted to recap our meeting to make sure all the details are correct"". 

&gt;Don't take it personally.

After now having been on the other side of this conversation when a student left with a project half done and me holding the deadlines, I can say that it is very frustrating to assume that your student, post-doc, research scientists, etc. will be doing a project and then let you know that they won't be able to finish it for whatever reason. My job is to get X, Y, and Z projects done by this date, and now project A has also been added to my plate.  This may be what your PI was feeling, and they lashed out in an attempt to keep you until May because it makes life easier for them.  HOWEVER, what is good for you and your life and your physical/mental health and well being is far more important than what makes life easier for them. 

You know your PI better than us, so take this in light of your experiences, if your PI sees your relationship as not just employer/employee but also mentor/mentee, then add to the conversation why this industry job is good for your life/career goals/health, etc. This could ease some of the sting of ""I'm leaving the group and academia as a whole.""

As for work management, what is most important is that you find a way to keep yourself organized and stick with it. For me, I'm very task-focused, so I created a ""master task list"" that contained everything I needed to do from now until graduation (sounds extreme, but I would update constantly and categorize tasks as needed). There are plenty of other strategies like Kanban, but stick with whatever models your work style best!

When you start reading and downloading journal articles, set up a reference manager like Zotero or Mendeley. It'll serve as your own personal library that you can draw from if you're writing your own research. Both Zotero and Mendeley have Microsoft Word plugins that can make importing and organizing references very easy.

If you have the opportunity, attending scientific conferences is a great way to meet others in the field! There's usually built in time for coffee breaks, which are ideal for meeting new people who you might otherwise not contact.

To build my CV: I'm presenting my work at a large national conference and networking, writing an NSF graduate fellowship grant, I'm guest lecturing at my local community college and high school, and I am an “invited speaker” (quotes because I asked to be) to the local comm colleges' official STEM seminar series as well. I'm considering getting involved with writing for my local magazines/newsletters.

To build my profile: Networking at conferences, brushing up my professional website and created a professional twitter, taking math courses to fill the gaps in knowledge I have, studying for the GRE, learning more coding.

But I think the other side of the coin is to take care of your mental health and do something fun: I substitute teach at the elementary school in the mornings and work with infants in the daycare during the evenings. I am working 7-6, and I couldn’t be happier. I've always wanted to do jobs with kids, but I never wanted that as a career since I have always wanted to be a professor, so I'm taking this chance to enjoy working completely outside my field.

Really?


Just to clarify - As a prospective applicant to a US PhD program, you are generally required to contact PIs prior to applying. This way you know who has funding for incoming students, and the type of projects the PI is anticipating to work on for the next ~5 years. You then are interviewed by these PIs prior to admission. Maybe it's different for different departments, but this is pretty much the standard in biomedical PhD programs.

Otherwise I do agree the mental health and work life balance for graduate students seems to be generally a lot better in Europe vs the US. But I have also heard European PhDs say they felt more pressure to ""cram"" in their experiments in a set time period to graduate on time, which seems stressful to me.

Obviously each system has its own advantages and disadvantages, but the idea that students apply to PhD programs with no preferred supervisor is not accurate in my experience.",1,2019-08-05 12:52:53
evzzgf5,t3_clr8gu,True,kittysezrelax,t2_5k99yod,"While I will occasionally work a long week (particularly around deadlines), it is rare that I work *substantially* more than a 40 hour week. Hell, I know I’ve worked less than 40 hours a week on more than one occasion. This was not true during coursework, but ever since passing my quals I’ve been able to manage my own schedule (besides teaching), which means I can work pretty efficiently because everything is scheduled and planned according to what I know works best for me (which I recognize is not a luxury other people will have, depending on their family commitments or field).

I use Hello Fresh for three dinners a week and do pick up for my other groceries, so spend little time grocery shopping. I do my laundry every Friday night before bed and let the dryer run while I sleep, so I never get overwhelmed with laundry and only have to spend 15 minutes folding it on Saturday. I get drinks with friends every few weeks and we usually spend a fair amount of that time talking about our work (much to my partner’s chagrin), so I consider my social life to be semi-productive in its own right. Since I only teach twice a week, it’s pretty easy to schedule appointments or run work-hour errands, and I try to do those things during off hours (not too early, never at lunch, and before the typical workday ends) so it takes less time. My grooming routine is my ME time and is preciously guarded, I’ve been know to leave social functions early because it’s my wine/bubble bath/skincare night. I’m in bed by 2am every night and wake up at 9:30 every morning.

And it's normal for something to not necessarily clicked very easily and not get an A.  If you are thinking of doing more schooling, take a look at the average GPA for those programs.

Not having a 4.0 doesn't make you any less of a person or get you anything special in the end.  Other than extra stress thinking you have to maintain it.

Everyone just adores her and they're always talking about how wonderful and generous she is, so it doesn't seem like she's actually a terrible human being that does this a lot.

I completely understand feeling this way. It’s incredibly normal and not at all surprising. The world is not so black and white though: good people do bad things. Maybe she was having a bad day and venting and didn’t realize that it was public. Maybe she and you had some kind of cascading failure of miscommunication that sparked it. Maybe she wrote it as a joke or troll post. There are a lot of explanations that *aren’t* “she’s evil.” 

&gt; If it wasn't written in duress, and she didn't write it because she's awful and wants to ruin my career, the only thing left is that she wrote it because she genuinely believes it. Which means I must have done something to incite it, and if I believe that then I have to worry that other people secretly hate me for the same thing.

This is not true. Even if we assume she wrote it because she genuinely believes it that **doesn’t necessarily mean** you did something wrong. Misinterpretations of your actions are typically *her fault* and not yours. You are certainly not blameworthy for her writing it.

Additionally, I don’t think that your trichotomy at the beginning is true though I’m not interested in litigating it. **The bottom line is that you are not to blame and you should not assume others think poorly of you**. This is really hard to do, but it’s really important. It’s totally reasonable for you to feel stressed, scared, or worried. It’s difficult, but learning to move on from inexplicably bad social interactions and not letting your social anxiety ruin interactions with others is an extremely important skill to build. Everyone experiences things like this, and you will experience it again in the future. Learning to let it go is one of the best things you can do.

fi5xvg3,t1_fi5mz20,True,mirabelle7,t2_2nm4cnv,"I agree with taking time off. I took two medical leaves during my PhD program. The first was during my 2nd semester due to a concussion. The second was a shorter leave of like 8 weeks for mental health reasons after my 4th year. I went back after my 2nd leave and finished within the year - even ahead of everyone else in my cohort despite my leaves. It was an awful time getting through the program. I’m still on the market and some days I’m not sure getting a PhD was worth it, but other days the skills I learned (really just about how to do pure research and think critically) have come in very handy just in every day life. Also - I met some of my now very best friends in my program. 

With all that being said, when I was in my 20s - work, research, and school were my life. Now, I prioritize relationships and relaxing more. I’m not even seeking tenure-track jobs because of this shift. So, it’s ok if you need some time off or if your life goals/priorities have changed (if you leave tho, I’d definitely do the leave of absence - just in case). But above all else - prioritize yourself and your health (physical and mental). Be selfish with this decision. Do not, I repeat, do NOT take anyone else’s feelings or circumstances into consideration. PhD programs are toxic/difficult for all sorts of reasons. You need to do what’s best for you.

fi5kvgo,t3_f6idha,True,ApesInSpace,t2_6lq7x,"A couple things:

1. First and foremost, don't sacrifice your mental health towards the degree. Don't ""bite the bullet,"" don't ""power through."" Yes, the first year of every single PhD program is brutal for everyone, and anyone who tells you otherwise is lying. As someone who never experienced severe anxiety before my own graduate program, I can say it absolutely produces that effect, even in people without a predisposition to it. But that kind of ""we're all fucked"" boot camp logic can actually **stop** people from seeking mental health counseling when they need it (after all, everyone in your cohort is stressed) and at the worst, it keeps people from making the right decisions for them. Don't hesitate to reach out to resources (sounds like you are, and that's awesome). And don't hesitate to leave if you realize that the grueling realities of graduate school aren't compatible with you being healthy or happy. 

2. What do you *want* to do? I stuck with my program because despite how fucking awful &amp; hard &amp; anxiety-inducing it was, I absolutely loved the project I was working on, and I loved the field I was in. Without those cornerstones - the steady knowledge that I loved this field, and I loved what I was doing - I never, ever would have continued through the shit. So I guess the best question might be: what kind of a project would be so cool, so fascinating to you, that it would be worth the difficulty of studying it for half a decade in painstaking detail? It's okay to not know yet (hell, I didn't find my dream project until year 3). But try to parse out a few different things... is it *this project* you hate? Is it *this field* you hate? Is it *academic work in general* you hate? 

(FWIW, saying yes to any or all of these is 100% okay and has zero bearing on your intelligence or ambition... but it's better to figure out which of these are the problem, early on in your program. I have friends who didn't figure out they hated academic research in general until their 3rd year. So good on you for identifying a major problem in your first year, and for considering possible routes if you decide to leave, like a Masters).",1,2020-02-20 02:21:32

Anyway, if you can I’d recommend talking to one or both of your PIs about what you’re going through as they’re likely to be understanding - they should know better than anyone how stressful PhD life can be. Your uni are likely to have also reinforced this as high stress is unfortunately a fairly common issue.

If you look up the different stages of culture shock, many of those will stilly apply even just moving between states in the US. If nothing else I hope it’s comforting that it’s normal to struggle when you move away from familiarity and your loved ones and give you a tool to think about if your experience falls into this temporary adjustment or if it’s truly a serious mental health issue.

The expectations are different, it is more research oriented, and you work more closely with your adviser.  When applying to grad school you are expected to be somewhat more specific in outlining what you want to do in the future and your research interests should align with your adviser's.  

In the humanities for an MA you are likely going to have to write some kind of thesis which requires original research.  Also classes tend to be more discussion based and require a lot of reading.  The professors tend to be more interested in hearing your original ideas than if you can regurgitate the  author's argument.  

I would say the thing I struggled with the most were maintaining my mental health, burnout, and the higher expectations professors have for you.

I would say museum/curatorial studies programs at the MA level are competitive but perhaps less so than PhD programs.  The biggest issue with MA programs is the lack of funding (this might be especially true if you're looking internationally) and the oversaturation in the market.  Still, if you are interested in entering the museum field, an MA in Museum Studies/Curatorial Studies will help you be more competitive when applying to jobs.",1,2020-02-19 22:40:58
fi15g5e,t3_f5svyl,True,Ut_Prosim,t2_coju6,"Pro-PhD: 

* Medical school costs an insane amount, you'll probably be $200k in debt by the end of it, a PhD program should pay you. If you fail out of a PhD halfway through you leave with an MS, if you fail out of MD halfway through you leave with $100,000+ of debt. 

* PhD is probably more capable quantitatively, better acclimated to the research environment, grant writing, publishing, data analytics, etc. (even versus an MD-PhD who probably focused the former).  

* MD is probably more stressful and more work. Don't get me wrong, a PhD is hard enough to cause all sorts of mental problems. I don't know anyone who got through my program without some physical health problems brought on by stress. But med school is even worse. My best friend went through it while I did my PhD, and I'm confident I wouldn't have made it. I pulled a few emergency writing sessions in grad school where I just slept in the lab and wrote, but med school seemed like that 24x7. Residency seemed even worse. They changed the law while my friend was going through it to limit the on-clock hours to 80 per week, as expected hospitals simply ordered them to lie. They'd work a normal day, clock out, then keep working usually 100-110 per week. I pulled a few weeks like that in my dissertation writing time, but it was never consistent week in week out.
___________
Pro-MD:

* If you're doing medical research in an academic hospital or med school, the MD will always be top dog, the PhD will always be seen as ancillary assistant. 

* MD will probably pay a lot more. 

* MD is far more flexible. There are probably a dozen total tenure-track spots in the USA that fit your exact PhD research and each one will get 150 applications. MD has the option of going into practice (with residency), and once they're done, they can go anywhere. Throw a dart at CONUS, is there a research university nearby? Probably not. Do they have a department that does what you do, and are they hiring? Almost certainly not. Is there a hospital nearby that needs doctors, all but guaranteed. If your spouse wants to move to RandomTown, USA, you're 100x more likely to find work as an MD than PhD.

* MD is four years, you finish or you fail. PhD can take twice as long if you're not focused or run into setbacks. 
__________
Neutral:

* MD vs PhD are a completely different experiences. The MD is incredibly structured, rigorous, memorization heavy. The PhD requires much self-reliance as you literally chart your own course.

I currently have a distinction in my coursework (73) and am in my final year. 

This past December while working on assignments which I submitted in early January, I was suffering from undiagnosed bipolar disorder which was gravely impacting my mental health/life in general. As I was only made aware of my diagnosis in mid-January, I did not submit any mitigating circumstances claims. I can appeal directly to the university though. 

That said, I received two 2:1s on the coursework returned (67/69). The remaining assessments would be an exam (70%) and an essay (50%) respectively in those courses. 

I’m beyond devastated though many of my classmates would no doubt be pleased with my marks.

Besides immediate actions that need to be taken (e.g., withdrawing the paper), I think you should continue communicating with your advisor and be open to discuss next steps to move forward.

On the note about taking care of your mental health, try taking a step back and consider how this single event might not be reflective of your life as a whole. You are a human being with multiple values and purposes - your life is meaningful.

Firstly, since you're at the very beginning of the academic journey, I feel that it's important to keep hold of the passion and motivation for what you want to persue, and that you should work with someone who inspire you. They don't need to be perfect (your last amazong adviser sound difficult to live up to), but it needs to work for both of you.

Secondly, sometimes people just don't work well together, call it personality/style clash whatever, doesn't have to be someone's fault. In my experience, it's just as valuable to find out who you really don't want to work with, as is with the inverse. 

So, you shouldn't ignore your feelings. If there is any scope to move to a different lab, definitely explore it seriously before deciding whether to stay or not. Also, talk to other people in the lab if you feel comfortable, see if you're the only one having issues with this particular person. Is there someone in the faculty you can speak to about these peoblems confidentially? Might be worth doing. 

If you move labs, you can simply say that the other lab's work interest you more, and not go into the real reason. The good news is that if she is a first year PhD, she probably doesn't have enough influence in other labs to affect you negatively.

I'm a super-strong supporter of having a good work-life balance. So I'd like to tell you to take it easy. However, you need to deal with 2 issues: i) peer pressure of your specific group, ii) keeping up with what's needed to have a good CV.

Concerning i) there's nothing we can tell you. Peer pressure sucks. Even if you produce 10x more than everyone else in your team combined, if you regularly work less hours you'll be seen as unprofessional. Even if others reddit/tinder 5 hours per day. It sucks. I truly hope it's not your case. I can do whatever I want at work and I couldn't be more grateful. If I need to go skiing because it just snowed I just phone in and I'm set. People from another team that I go to lunch with, cannot take days off, even if planning it in advance, unless it's August, because otherwise it ""looks lazy"".

Concerning ii) this is really a critical issue. Research is like competitive sports. It makes sense to be a researcher only if you're doing world class stuff. And it does require working quite a lot. I worked 35hours/week like you for years and I was doing ok but nothing that could land me tenure or even visibility. 2 years ago I had some issues and I decided that I wanted to show what I was capable of.

Since december I'm slowing down and planning to live off what I've done. I wouldn't have gotten here however without working so badly those 2 years.  However my PhD publications were few and sucked... Also PhDs here are short... so maybe you've already produced something that you can live off... Just keep checking what your potential ""competitors"" for a tenure position are producing.

Also, most of my time spent working/at work is lost between ""trying to focus"" (I'm really terrible at it) and being interrupted for questions, meetings, ""fixing the lab devices"" for those that don't understand them, tutoring the student etc...

With regard to your supervisor, have a frank conversation with them about how you're feeling, your concerns and where you're struggling.

In that time, I've taught 30-odd sections of 20+ different courses, grad and undergrad. Only a few of them have I taught more than once or twice--and with those, to be honest, it's mostly been great: I just keep refining the course, seeing what's worked and what hasn't, tinkering with my own sense of what I want and of who my students are, revising as the students themselves change. It's pretty intrinsically interesting.

Personally, if anything I was teaching got truly boring (I don't mean a bad semester or whatever: I mean really boring), I'd just stop teaching that and teach other things--or, if stuck with a course for some reason, would start teaching it totally differently in ways I thought would be interesting.

In fairness, all of my courses are organized (to one degree or another) around live questions for the discipline (which I try to pitch at different levels to meet students where they're at), so they're kind of by definition interesting to me, at least.

It can be hard to live with the difficulties of being somebody while also going in and setting up conditions where students can have transformative (or at least intellectually useful and personally meaningful) experiences.

Some people compartmentalize hardcore. They treat their teaching persona and teaching life as fundamentally separate from their larger self, and sort of set aside other aspects of their lives in order to teach effectively.

Personally, I find that heavy-duty compartmentalizing doesn't work very well for me. I live a more satisfying life when I am pretty much who I am across all domains of it, when I'm well-integrated. That said, to a certain extent, there's no way around it--if you're having a really hard time, you can't just drop that onto your students' shoulders. So, some compartmentalizing is necessary. If you just had a rough argument with your partner or with a colleague, you can't come in and offload that on students.

But, again for me personally, I need to be a pretty well-integrated person or else I kind of fall apart. That's especially true for the big stuff, but also means that I try to work through moods I'm having before teaching (instead of stuffing feelings or just setting them aside).

I pray before I teach, asking whatever it is that helps me to help me get out of the way and offer something useful to my students. Often, what happens is that aspects of my own personal difficulties (when these arise) then get incorporated into the work of the classroom--not explicitly, but as a kind of private subtext. Other times (like with talking about climate change or overtly destigmatizing mental health difficulties for my students), I end up talking pretty directly with my students about the things that comprise my various crises (in general, but not so much in a ""here's my life"" way, except when my little brother died--I had to leave for the funeral, and there was no functional way to avoid disclosing that; my students were very kind to me when I returned).

For the lecture thing, I dunno. I give impromptu lectures about things that students seem to be struggling with, but for the most part we do a lot of active classroom stuff. I'm still ""on,"" but it's not quite the same.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that, in my experience, it's an entirely feasible to be a professor and be a ""whole person"" (at least, to the extent that this is feasible for any labor under capitalism). Also, lest I give the wrong impression, I'm for the most part fairly sunny in disposition (in my way); you asked about the difficulties, though, so that's what I've tried to speak to here.

During my PhD, we had football players beating women, doing drive bys with BB guns, I’ve had students talk to me about emotional issues, and I was almost mugged at 6 am by someone who thought they were invisible in a black hoodie.  We also had a student who was weeks from graduation die in a car accident.

Honestly, I’ve become numb to the whole thing.  I always promote mental health during day one of the semester and share resources if students need help.  If a student needs assistance, I direct them to the counseling center and if they need an extension I give it.

But death happens.  People die.  It sucks, it’s bad, but you either sit there crying everyday or you move on.  

That said, death is not new to me.  I’ve seen dead bodies and I’ve been around violence.  My brother did 14 years for murder.

Even if, however, he did do something that could have been construed as harassment had it come from a neurotypical individual, his autism has to be considered. For example, if he said or did anything inappropriate, he may not have realized it, and as such should have been reminded that such behavior was inappropriate and explained why. (And probably by someone in the DRC rather than the department chair.) Again, however, based on the post, there's nothing to suggest that his behavior crossed that line. 

Although I'm not a legal expert, the standard for emotional distress is ""extreme and outrageous conduct"" that is ""beyond all bounds of decency."" Here we have a department chair who, despite being aware that this student was mentally disabled (and in such a way that would predispose him to experience trauma \[people with autism can be easily overwhelmed\]), ignored his disability accommodations and berated him to the point of tears and a suicide attempt.

However, the DRC rather than the chair should have been contacted, and they could have worked out a compromise. For example: maybe he would only come to her office at certain hours but she would make more time for him than other students due to his disability. 

Even being summoned to the department chair for a meeting may have been too traumatizing for him, but for him to berate this student with a known mental health disability was extreme negligence at best.

One substitute lecture became 2 became 6 became me teaching 1/3 of the course before any other faculty member found out and intervened. I never thought to tell anyone and was in such a poor mental state that I blamed myself for my inability to be a primary lecturer for a course I had TA'd once before. I was taking my own classes during this time and had to withdraw from 2 courses mid-semester, 1 course another semester, got a C in a course (as you know, grad school ""fail"") and was placed on academic probation. I was not productive with research. I had sought counseling and psychiatric help the entire time and experienced recovery with symptoms getting worse. Finally, at a routine physical (and months after first working with a psychiatrist) I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism.

Gah, your experience was so full of red flags!  It sounds like you ran into a perfect storm of a terrible mentor and an unaccommodating program.  And, I agree that there is a huge onus on the student to complain and then endure the fallout.  I guess that's one of the things that we should try and change.  No easy solutions there, though.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;PIs, as I'm sure you're aware, are there primarily for their skills as a  scientist, not for their man-management (which can often be quite  dismal). This is a big difference between gown and town, as  man-management is a huge consideration when hiring for senior positions  in a non-academic institutions. I can't think of a good solution that  doesn't add to the already horrific administrative bloat in most  universities.

This gets at something else I was trying to make clear: most managers in companies also started out as individual contributors and then rose to management ranks.  Sometimes they get MBAs or other formal training, and sometimes not.  In my department there is active mentorship of junior faculty and lots of looking over the shoulder as they guide their first set of students.  I think this helps give new faculty at least some tools that help them and their students succeed.  Not to say it's perfect, but it's worlds apart from your experience.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Y'see, this is part of my issue. I  don't want to put words in your mouth so I won't accuse you of saying  this, but the reaction I get from some people in academia when I tell  the about my issues with the field is something along the lines of  (""well, if you were just looking to advance your career, this isn't the  place for you""). Or, even worse, that I wasn't cut out for it because I  lacked resilience or perspective.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ofc I want to advance my career, but I genuinely *do*  love science, and I do want to be a part of something that advances the  wealth of our scientific knowledge, and maybe one days benefits  society. I understand that certain sacrifices must be made for that. But  I also don't want to be treated like shit for 3-6yrs for a  poverty-level stipend. I really didn't think that was too much to ask.

Based on our brief interaction, it seems clear to me that you have resilience and perspective.  And, I'll own that I was reflecting on my personal experience as a mentor more than what you'd specifically written.  Nobody should be treated like shit - end of story.  It's super sad that you were.  I guess just know that there are many places that are not like what you described (and some that are, unfortunately).  Our main disagreements are 1) I see most of academia as somewhere between benign and positive and 2) I see other professional realms as equally burdened by people being assholes.  But, that's just my perspective.

&gt;I'm really glad things worked out for you in academia. I mean that  sincerely, I'm not trying to be snarky. But man, it's so hard not to be  bitter.

Totally understandable.  Maybe you can find a silver lining by working really hard to find good environments to work in and by being a defender of what is good/right.  That's what I was getting at in my first post.  As hard as this experience was for you, it probably taught you what you DON'T want in terms of environment and also showed you how NOT to act when you are in a position of power and influence.  Before you know it you'll be calling the shots.

&gt; OK, I'll bite 

Oh this wasn't intended as bait or a concern troll! I was genuinely interested in what PIs would have to say.  


Anyway, before we proceed, I should probably disclose what the main issue was. Due to my disability (affects manual dexterity and short-term memory), I struggled a lot with memorising and carrying out lab protocols and screwed up a fair bit. My supervisor assumed this was due to some mixture of laziness, cynicism and incompetence, so prevented me from doing a lot of things that I needed for my thesis so that I didn't waste lab resources. After I brought it up with the course coordinators &amp; disability office (who were sympathetic but kinda useless lol), I was begrudgingly allowed. But this resulted in me getting quite publicly berated whenever I got things wrong. 

It didn't help that the lab was poorly funded (despite being quite prestigious??) and a pretty unpleasant environment in general. Very passive aggressive and a *lot* of bitching; didn't walk in on anything being said about myself, but I can only assume. I remember on one of my first days I walked in on a heated meeting about a plagiarism accusation. Everyone seemed miserable and at each other's throats. I've worked in a bunch of different places, and this was hands down the worst working environment I've ever encountered. And is, unfortunately corroborated by a lot of people I've spoken to in academia.

The whole thing wore me down quite a lot and really fucked with my mental health. I've never had anxiety before, but I was having almost daily panic attacks in the lab. I considered taking the complaint further, but I didn't want the hassle; I just wanted to get the degree and gtfo. Which I now have done.

 

&gt;There are definitely asshole PIs, just like in any other industry. And, they do make life hell for students. In my field, they are widely known and students are actively steered away from their labs. The occasional moth does get drawn to the flame, despite warnings, though. I think we, as a community could do much better in upholding higher standards for PIs through both formal and informal processes. 

This is good to know that other PIs are aware of it. But this lack of accountability speaks to the institutional problems in academia. I didn't pursue a formal complaint because I needed my PI's help to complete my thesis and for a reference, and I didn't want to get myself buried in some bureaucratic ""he-said, she-said"" shitshow that dragged out for months.

PIs, as I'm sure you're aware, are there primarily for their skills as a scientist, not for their man-management (which can often be quite dismal). This is a big difference between gown and town, as man-management is a huge consideration when hiring for senior positions in a non-academic institutions. I can't think of a good solution that doesn't add to the already horrific administrative bloat in most universities. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;With that said, students themselves bring all sorts of baggage, which PIs are only partly empowered to help resolve. For example, many students have a terrible time because they have unrealistic expectations or a bad attitude. Here I think that we should be doing a better job of teaching students professionalism and also showing them the door if things aren't working out. 

Yeah, grad students aren't perfect, and bring their own problems. I agree with your assessment; this shows one of the many ways in which academia suffers from not being approached as a normal working environment. Were this a company, employees who for whatever reason are struggling would be given appropriate feedback, and yes, shown the door if it's not a good fit. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Finally, the system sometimes causes problems for PIs and students alike. Mainly, systematic issues revolve around funding or visas, either of which can be problematic in ways that cause students to suffer. I am not sure what solutions could be implemented for these issues, other than to more fully fund research.

Generally agreed. You can't solve every issue by throwing money at it. But research could certainly benefit from a little bit of that haha

&gt; If you are min/maxing your career, graduate school in basic science is not the way to go. For example, private sector finance or computer science yield more financial reward per unit effort.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;As you move to the private sector, I would strongly encourage you to think hard about why your graduate experience was so bad. Many of the same conditions that make graduate school hard (high expectations, power dynamics, externally imposed challenges) can be just as bad or worse in industry. Developing the skills to weather these difficulties in a positive way can be really empowering.

Y'see, this is part of my issue. I don't want to put words in your mouth so I won't directly accuse you of saying this, but the reaction I get from some people in academia when I tell the about my issues with the field is something along the lines of (""well, if you were just looking to advance your career, this isn't the place for you"").  
Ofc I want to advance my career, but I genuinely *do* love science, and I do want to be a part of something that advances the wealth of our scientific knowledge, and maybe one days benefits society. I understand that certain sacrifices must be made for that. But I also don't want to be treated like shit for 3-6yrs for a poverty-level stipend. I really didn't think that was too much to ask.

To jump on the ""Not a PI"" bandwagon I think it's interesting to look at the incentives.

For students you get no reward at all until you get the degree. So basically it's this horrible game that once you start the cost of quitting gets higher and higher. Your bargaining power with your PI is low because your option to walk away with nothing (but debt) is so bad. I mean if you PI said you had to take 10 lashes the day before you viva otherwise you couldn't do it I think most people would say yes, which shows how fucked your incentives are.

For the PI there again isn't really much incentive to be a great boss. Academia these days revolves around publications, if you can get 1 paper from a happy student or 2 from a sad one then it's no contest. The student is also pretty disposable and even if they quit the problems for the PI are quite small, you can always blame the student for their own mental health problems.",1,2019-09-16 22:09:17

“It wouldn’t make sense to finish out the semester, because I was only signed up for classes that would fulfill my major,”

Careful here. Just carrying in credit can count toward electives when you transfer, and as a freshman, you’re likely taking gen eds that will transfer. It’s unlikely at a four-year college that you’re taking courses that are “in the major”. 

Also, if you drop them after the drop/add period, you could get failing grades and transfer your 0.0 GPA with you to your new school. All of that crap and you’ll still get charged for the classes and get student debt. If you fail out / withdraw too late, your financial aid may not apply and you may get another fat bill from the school. Scary stuff! 

You should have an assigned counselor. Make sure you understand the implications of your plan to:

1. Your GPA
2. Your financial aid / debt 
3. Your ability to re-enroll in the future 

Ask about your options based on your current mental health situation. Your school counselor can document for you and help back you up. 

Make sure you work with your school to withdraw with the least amount of negative consequences for your future. If you can finish those courses, you will be surprised at how they may transfer to another school.

It would be okay for a friend or neighbor/R.A. to knock on the door. However, the student wouldn't be expecting such a visit from his adviser. Suppose he wasn't fully dressed when he answered the door thinking it was a student--only to find his adviser at his door? No matter what the situation, it would be awkward at best. Maybe he just experienced a break-up or personal setback and doesn't want to be seen in such as distressed state or in the throes of mental illness. How much more embarrassing would it be to have his adviser show up at his door?

Alternatively,if he doesn't answer the door, how far should they go to get in touch with him? Since you said he doesn't have a right to privacy, should they be able to enter without his permission?

Is the task to go *convince them to come to class* or is the task to *find out if they are okay*? It sounds like the latter to me. 

Unlike some of the other commenters, I do not think that latter task is clearly unethical. Schools organize themselves in different ways. And it would, in my opinion, likely be unethical for *no one* to reach out to a student struggling in this way. It's *someone's* job and academic advising is not necessarily a ridiculous candidate.  

However, even if it is something that could reasonably be in your job description, you, personally, might still be a bad fit for this task.

It’s ok to take a break: instead of a depressive state where you’re stressed and feel like you need to be working, plan to take a vacation so you can actually de stress (if that’s possible). Or when you’re working, try to impose a more limited schedule on your work time and you may find that you’ll have the willfulness to work for a longer number of weeks.

Sometimes I wish they had, sometimes not, but generally think it's fine to let people know what you are comfortable knowing in a general sense. Here I think it's okay to say something like ""I need to take some time off to deal with mental health issues"". 

What is harder as a 'boss' is dealing with people who don't have clear boundaries about information or expect (even inadvertently) for me to play a role of therapist or provider-of-validation. Those are not really my job (i can validate when they do well, or encourage them to keep at it, but it's not always easy to mix discussion about science or academics with health). I would definitely not be trained to be a therapist, and it's nice if you can keep those different mentoring roles in slightly separate categories. 

I also think, in your case, that a 60h week is too much. Can I guess that you aren't being paid much, or paid overtime costs? That's just far too much for a student worker to be doing.

Anecdotally, I struggle with similar mental health issues, though they come in waves of intensity and are certainly worse some weeks than others. I work full-time in an administrative role at my university, and having just finished my first (and likely most intensive) semester of my Master's degree, I found both positives and negatives in pursuing a graduate education while concurrently working 40 hours per week. I find that my depressive episodes are worse when I don't have rigid deadlines and responsibilities to keep me busy, and I often found myself too busy to get in my own head too much about that stuff. On the flipside, I was definitely overwhelmed at a couple of points last semester when I allowed myself to fall a little behind on coursework. That in itself does not help reinforce a positive image of oneself. As one could expect, my social life also suffered, and I found myself missing out on gatherings with friends that I would have otherwise been a part of. You have to weigh the value of what your time is spent on, but still not a good feeling. I'm glad that my course load will be more bearable moving forward.

I also want to mention that I'm jealous of you, and others here, who get tuition benefits for working at your university. At my school, and throughout the state's university system, we can only be reimbursed for 3 credits per semester, it has to be related to your professional role in the university (either directly relevant to your position or something that will lead to progression within the field), and your department has to pay for it. This is a great deal for someone in that situation and willing to attend part-time, but unfortunately I am pursing my graduate degree in a field unrelated to the one I'm currently working in (full-time) and my department is underfunded as is.  I didn't even bother asking, as I know we don't have the money to pay for me to take classes that will lead to me eventually leaving within a year.

It sounds like you, on the other hand, have the complete support of your bosses, and that they believe in you and your abilities. It sounds like they have confidence in you and your abilities, and the fact that they'd be your advisors would, I think, make a huge difference in the mental health aspect. 

Like you know them, you'd go in knowing that they believe in you and are actually invested in your success-- certainly things that would have helped me see my own worth and trust in my academic potential.

I’ve spent the last decade working in public policy nonprofits, and the last six years in a senior management role at one of those nonprofits. My job became increasingly stressful. It was 9-5 and I had the luxury of working remotely sometimes but, still, was generally expected to be “on the clock” from 9 to 5 (and of course had many days and weeks of longer hours). 

I started this phd with the assumption that I do NOT want a career in academia after I earn the phd but now I’m questioning that, and a big part of the reason why has to do with the schedule flexibility that faculty have. They do tons of work, but it isn’t on a rigid 9 to 5 schedule. Every job has its stressors, but I have a new appreciation for how much a flexible schedule can contribute to my mental health and wellbeing, even if just for accommodating the unexpected problems that come up in life.

My main point is that it’s all relative. Every job has awful parts and great parts and it takes time to figure out which of those matter most to you, and which type of job will give you the best balance. Also, that can and probably will change over time! When I finished my masters degree 10 years ago, transitioning to a 9 to 5 schedule felt like freedom.

I do agree that course design is 100% an easier mechanism by which we can address social inequalities, but at the same time I don't think a system of mild weighting based on social background and other risk factors for disadvantage would hurt in grading mechanisms as long as it's not tipping grades by 5+ percentage points.

For example, departments love to tout being there for mental health/LGBTQ people/etc. but in my experience the conversation really doesn't go much further than that. It would be nice for people to be interested in such things when it actually comes to how it's affecting your time in grad school.

I do think academia is pretty personal when it comes to the average person, but in situations like these it seems like suddenly the workplace isn't the place for that, which I've always thought was bizarre given the random knowledge I have of people's personal lives.

Maybe it's different in other fields but that's been my experience in the physical sciences. It's definitely a multi-faceted problem but the juxtaposition with how personal interactions can be highlights it.",5,2020-01-04 01:27:20

The GPA is an obstacle but not unsurmountable, and after you pass your graduate classes, your grades are not important at all.  My problem like yours, was mental health and study habits, so you want to resolve that somehow. I understand what you mean by motivation, school work often is ""boring"" because you are learning for learning sake's, rather than being motivated by the necessities of a project/your own interests.

fcuczg7,t3_eixchm,True,Brett_Hoover_PhD,t2_1jxh5ct,"My perspective is from the US, and not in biotech. So I don't know how directly relevant it is.  
  
My opinion is that if you feel uneasy about pursuing a PhD, it is not in your best interest to pursue it. You are right to recognize that the tenure track professor job market is extremely competitive. I don't think professors do a good enough job of explaining just how competitive the market is, and what the chances of success are for their students to break into it. A lot of professors know nothing but academia, and went through the hiring process many years ago when the market may have been very different. Or they are superstars who have an experience with the job market that is very different from the majority of tenure track applicants. There simply aren't enough tenure track jobs to meet the supply of PhDs, not by a long shot, and the majority of PhDs won't have these jobs. And the ones who *do* get a tenure track job may find themselves being exploited by departments who see the junior professor as a captive asset, loading them up with job duties that cause serious harm to their work/life balance and mental health. What are you going to do, leave? You're lucky to have the job you've got, right? So you're a horse, and no matter how fast you run, they keep whipping you to go faster. Universities (in the US, at least) are transitioning away from tenure track positions and toward part-time lecturer-pool and adjunct positions, which reduces costs on their end by offering a pittance to the large number of underemployed PhDs in the work force to compete for teaching a class here, a class there, with no job security and few if any benefits. It's bleak.  
  
If you're interested in changing career paths, I think you owe it to yourself to research your options. What kind of work can you get with a biotech MS (or PhD! - you don't have to work in academia), versus an MBA? What are employers looking for? I'm not in the field, so I can't answer these questions, but employers can.",1,2020-01-02 15:14:28

fcklc0l,t3_egg9y0,True,AcademicX,t2_3pdjhx3w,"I think students don't realize that teaching and grading papers are not the only things that we do.  Professors have to do research, write and revise papers for publication if we ever hope to get a raise/promotion, and do committee work for the university and our department which often also requires reports.  When we aren't in the office or the classroom we aren't enjoying a bunch of free time.  

Based upon these responsibilities, we organize our semesters so that we have certain weeks for grading, certain weeks for research and writing, etc.  And, yes, we try our best to schedule some vacation/family time for our own mental health.  We deserve free time, too.  As students know, constantly reading, researching, and writing papers is mentally exhausting.  We are not at our own personal best or good for our families when we are stretched too thin. 

When we are near the end of the semester and are beginning to mentally unwind  as we prepare for our own break, it is so frustrating when emails and office visits begin pouring in from students who never talked to us before but suddenly want to give excuses as to why they should be allowed to submit late work.  It is never just one student asking for these extra considerations, either--students think they are the only one trying to negotiate more time/a better grade--but there are always *at least* two in every class that are haggling with us via email or in person. 

Depending upon the assignment/exam, late grading could take up a good chunk of a day.  We have to to get final grades submitted by a specific date or else we have to go the extra layer of doing grade changes, and some departments get in trouble for having too many faculty grade change submissions, so we are hustling to get everything graded by a certain date.  Now all of a sudden we have at least six late papers/exams to grade if we want to meet the deadline for grading, and our ""day off"" or our entire weekend is now spent grading late work even though we did *our* job and had everything grading on time.  

Do I love my students? YES, I do--I love my job, I love seeing students succeed, I love when they are still using me for job or grad school references years later because I had such a positive influence on their lives.  But, I absolutely feel broken down by the haggling process at the end of every semester when I have to tell my own kids no, I can't come to your class party, or no, I can no longer be a chaperone for your field trip, because I still have more grading to do in order to meet university deadlines--grading that would have been done if everything had been submitted when due. 

Sometimes I wonder if I should explain this to students at the beginning of a semester?  Most of them are too young to understand if I were to try to explain that I need my down time, too, my kids and spouse would like to have the time I promised to them dedicated only to them, etc.  Maybe students will be able to think back and remember what it was like when their mom was the only one who didn't help out at the holiday party, or their dad worked through the weekend and missed a family event he was supposed to participate in?

No, there is no such thing as ""informing your professor that they have mental issues at the start of the semester"". These students will at best try to talk to you at the end of the semester but most of them will simply drop your class or just never show up to the exams even though they almost finished it.

fc7khx6,t3_egg9y0,True,m_i_k_e1,t2_3o24l1uc,"I'm seeing this post after the updates, ya that students gets the grade they deserve :/

I struggled with mental health all throughout college. The only reason I passed is because my professors were flexible and helped me out. I always talked to them ahead of time though, asking for extensions prior to the due dates and always putting in my best effort when I could do my work. Sometimes I'd get some points deducted from a late paper but I still put the effort in to fully complete the assignment. I wouldn't have been able to get through college without the professors flexibility but I still feel I earned my degree. I did all the work the other students did; it's just sometimes it took me a bit longer to succeed. 

My department had quite flexible attendance policies. When my depressive episodes hit the worst it was hard for me to get out of bed in the morning and when my anxiety was bad I might be physically in class but not mentally present. I was pretty consistent with communicating with my professors about all this and would talk to them during their office hours. As long as I was showing I was engaging with the material they were teaching and meeting the learning goals they set for the course they typically wouldn't deduct points for attendance. When I was well I'd share thoughtful ideas and ask good questions quite regularly. My professors got to know me pretty well and by the time I was in my junior and senior years some professors were able to read me pretty well and would check in if they noticed something was off. 

Sometimes I would be doing really poorly. In those times I'd talk to my professors and be honest. What would it take for me to get a B- in their class that semester? I wouldn't expect them to just give me an A just because and I wouldn't ask for that. I'd lower my goals, disengage a big more than normal, and focus on doing what I needed to to get better. My professors would know this and sometimes they'd let me know how to complete an assignment in a way that would take less time but still get me a passing grade. If I had a 90% in the class thus far they might let me know that if i turned in a big assignment that was a page or two short or a week late i could get a 70% on it and still get a B- or better in the class. Other times I'd be doing well, get really excited about a project, and go well above and beyond the expectations. I finished college with a 3.5

Through all this I developed some serious life and communication skills that help me as a post college adult. I'm better able to assess what commitments I can and can't keep before making them. I'm able to be honest upfront with people. I know my limitations well and know how much I can reasonably take on. I know my cycles and really take advantage of when I'm doing well to set myself up to still be fine when I'm not. I'm about to set boundaries and know how to ask for help in a fair way. 

I'm really thankful for the flexibility of my professors. I would have dropped out sophomore or junior year without their support. It was a give and take though. If I wasn't communicating with them and turning in quality work I don't think they would have been able to or should have let me pass their classes. 

It seems you do let students know you'll work with them if they talk to you about it. I'd suggest really emphasizing that at the beginning of the semester. No one is just a student; everyone has many complex sides to them and sometimes that interferes with their course work.

I did mine right at the end of when your mentality was dominant (and likewise held by yours truly), and it did not occur to me, for example, that freezing up for 2h of a 3h exam -- literally incapable of understanding the English in a single question -- was not a 'normal' reaction to stress. I did not understand that being unable to get out of bed all day was something one could (and should) see a doctor for. I was able to half-ass my way through the basic school system with high grades despite those now-obvious disabilities. It takes a few semesters to figure out what is going on. I think it didn't occur to anyone else that I needed help then, and it's sure as hell hard to figure that stuff out when you're under influence of a failing brain. Thankfully, I think public understand of mental health and disabilities in general has gotten a lot better now, but if an instructor could help tip off a student to seek help, they could well save that student's career. I took my F's, all 7 or 8 of them throughout, and the GPA of 2, because in my mind then, I was born ""normal"" and learning disabilities and mental health issues did not apply to me. No one said anything otherwise for a long time...

Ultimately, I still ended up where I wanted to be, it just took a lot of extra work on part of people who wanted to recruit me to grad school and research. Life's complicated, and I get that it shouldn't be a lecturer's job to negotiate social and psychological issues, but the reality is that as an instructor (or even TA) you are in a position to seriously help some of your students in ways that go beyond the narrow topic of any given course, and it would be a shame to not at least occasionally take advantage of that.

It happens sometimes that students who are already struggling with their mental health expect professors to act in a parental or therapist role. I had one student in particular a couple years ago who I can only describe as ""clingy"" in ways that made me very uncomfortable. He was a close talker to begin with, but would also want to sit right next to me (I mean right next to me... even in a room where there were lots of seats available so you could have one in between you and still communicate just fine), came to office hours often, and at the same time was prone to frustrated outbursts. It was a bit scary, though I think from his perspective he was just awkward and didn't understand social cues well. 

A bigger issue for myself and other academics in my social science field is harassment from the alt-right. Many of us have been targeted at different times because we do research that relates to racial inequality. In that sense, I would say the public aspects of the job can be very challenging. If your work is covered in alt-right sources like Breitbart or the College Fix it can quickly result in really terrifying harassment that can go on for months (or longer, in some cases). 

I think the public nature of academia lends itself to attracting weirdos. People have their assumptions about who we are and what we do and they feel entitled to us in certain ways that go beyond our role as knowledge-producers and academic researchers (especially for those of us at public universities). This includes students, who may be used to the hands-on nurturing approach of many high school teachers, or who are just generally lost and so end up looking to their professors for emotional support in ways that go beyond what most of us are comfortable with. 

It's important to note too that 99% of my interactions with students and people outside of academia are just fine. But it is the sort of thing where when it's bad, it can be really bad.

I don’t think extra credit assignments should move someone up a whole grade (unless they’re large enough assignments), but not offering them at all is quite harsh. I don’t assume all of my students are full time students whose parents just pay for their full rides so they can just focus on school. I’ve seen students who work full time, who are parents, who have health problems, etc. I don’t get why giving them options is so bad. Lazy students who don’t care usually won’t take the extra credit opportunities (if they’re actual assignments, and not just a survey or something easy). Usually it is students who really do care and are trying their best to do well who will benefit, and I certainly want those people to succeed. I’m sorry your enlightened colleagues disagree, and I’m even sorrier for the student who is working 40 hours per week and going to school full time who are working super hard and trying their best to do well despite their circumstances.

fboug8p,t3_ed17at,True,TheProfessorO,t2_1mg5djal,In the last two years my department has been dealing with more mental health issues problems then the previous few decades put together.    This winter break I am involved with 2 different special exams for students even though I am on break and we never had exams at special times before.  I now have students  unhappy because I am not exactly teaching the class the way they want it to be taught.   One student scheduled her doctor's appointments on the exam dates even though she knew the dates months in advance and then demanded I give her a special exam only when she wanted to take it.  This is just the tip of the iceberg and it is going to get worse. The root cause is screen time and social media.   We should make sure our departments have guidelines in place to deal with all of the issues.,1,2019-12-22 11:34:27
fbmbhsb,t3_edxmrt,True,sagaciux,t2_yw2qr,"This is more from the student's perspective, but complaints may also be due to a perception that the exam was unfair. I fully believe that educators are most respected because of their fairness, not their ""niceness"". A large part of this is laying out clear expectations for what students are expected to do, and providing sufficient material (lectures, notes, problem sets, etc.) to demonstrate the standard that is expected.

While students are responsible for preparing thoroughly for their courses, there are many reasons why this may not happen (work, mental health, or immaturity, for example). Students may be under a great deal of pressure to achieve a certain grade, whether due to family or scholarships or entrance requirements. Final exams can be especially stressful given that they are typically worth 50% of the overall grade. A student may not study beyond the notes, problem sets, and/or past exams of the course, and as a result perform worse on an unexpected set of exam questions. In this context it isn't surprising for students to have a strong emotional reaction.

I would not advocate for making exams easier, especially for the sake of grades, but I do believe exams should be predictable to a certain degree. Stress is counterproductive to learning, and preparing for assessments is not always equivalent to deep and persistent learning. Shifting difficulty and grade weight towards midterms, quizzes, and assignments, especially earlier in the semester when there is less time pressure, can help reduce the stress and importance of the final exam. Providing detailed expectations, exemplars of quality work, prompt feedback, and a general sense of compassion towards students will go a long way to ease the pain of difficulty. Most importantly, students will respect a fair educator and a fair assessment, and this fairness can even inspire students to put in enormous effort to overcome difficult material.",1,2019-12-22 02:22:05
fbhn5eb,t1_fbhikul,True,PresenceCondition,t2_567h43cy,it's a thread about students asking for accomodations/leniency because of mental health reasons how is it not related,1,2019-12-20 21:33:57
fbhcyz9,t1_fbfmx2j,True,Katkool,t2_d87zw,"Point 1: You're assuming people will judge them for going to a mental health center. Maybe it depends on the region but going in for mental health is seen as a sign of personal strength and wisdom where I'm from. Even if it is, that is not always a strong reason as to why someone didn't seek out support in the first place. How is everyone supposed to know you went to the mental health center? This isn't high school, people are not concerned about social standings, and medical records are kept private for a reason. 

Point 2: It's a desperate attempt to salvage their performance because it's at the last minute. NO ONE would be talking about ethics if they had reached out anytime before or near their issues with the course. It seems desperate because if they had mental health issues and took responsibility, asking for help wouldn't come at December 20th, way after they can do anything to fix their grades. Take a look at the replies in this thread and you'll see people who have struggled with serious mental health issues and still support the professor directing them to mental health services but not automatically giving them a passing grade. The university has grades so that people who do well are recognized as doing well by the standards the university sets. Diminishing that standard reduces the hard work that students have gone through to achieve good grades and leads me to my third point.

Point 3: You claim that ""it's not like these are Oxford scientists or Yale Law students and so giving undeserved grades is ok. If college is not ""the Olympics"" as you have pointed out, then why is it so big a deal to give them a failing grade? If college is what I think it is, a 4 year experience whose value lasts for about as long as your first 1 or 2 full-time jobs, then getting an F and redoing the course later is not a big deal either by your same logic. Also are people who are in high stakes environments less deserving of empathy because of how prestigious their university is?

Point 4: You keep citing the most terrible examples of mental health that people experience in our society. That is somewhat fair, as these issues do exist and it is not possible for most of us to even comprehend what these people have gone through. This is not a strong point however because it is completely speculative. IF these students suffered terrible things, then they should get a pass, is not a strong argument. Then you also must ask, how terrible must the situation be in order to deem it worthy of an excuse? Then someone has to judge the situation, which comes all the way back to where we are now, which is to direct people to mental health resources and have someone recommend if a student should receive leniency or not. Saying ""I have mental health problems"" should not become an end-all argument as people will start to have problems with that logic and the issues surrounding mental health will take on the negative idea of ""this is an excuse"". Just yesterday I saw someone trying to con the professor into giving them a passing grade because of several illegitimate reasons but passed them off in an emotionally charged way. Also I know that it's is not fair for people who have mental health issues to suffer more than everyone else because of things they can't control. That's why we have and are developing a mental health system to try and level the playing field. I say develop because I'm certain that colleges can improve their process. 

Point 5: Saying ""get a grip"" is undeniably rude. Calling someone's ego ""fragile"" is undeniably rude. Maybe you like the burn factor a little much but if you really want to defend your opinion and your take on mental health, be more rational so that people on the other side of the argument take you seriously. I'm sure it works great for people who agree with you and want to get fired up but it is in no way a good idea for settling a disagreement. Why do you think the OP feels like replying is pointless? Because the tone of your argument suggests you're not willing to settle or compromise. 

Point 6: A lot of what's being said in this thread is tied to people relating their own similar mental health experiences. I have had similar experiences to this topic and others who agree with me have had similar experiences to this topic.

Usually, they said no or didn't respond, but this was a few years ago and there was a bigger stigma on mental health than there is now.

As the instructor, I think it would depend on the situation. For example, if I had a student that showed up to office hours every week and was doing well, then suddenly they stopped showing up and started doing poorly, I'd reach out to see if they're OK. If a student just never shows up to class/office hours and they're not doing well, I *probably* wouldn't say anything because I wouldn't know how to approach them (since they, hypothetically, never show up to class/office hours).",1,2019-12-20 17:45:01

The student health center is usually good at teaching students who are just dealing with temporary anxiety or stress, how to handle that stress or alleviate it.

The disability resource center is where they should go if they have a **diagnosed** mental condition and need accommodations such as longer time on tests or assignments which legally you would not be able to give them otherwise. Also note that this still doesn't mean leniency in grading in most if not all cases.

I'd make them turn in all their missing work before I'd even consider being lenient about my grading policy, but it also would depend on what effort the individual student has made over the entire semester. Mental health issues suck, but there are plenty of people living with severe mental health disorders who do turn in their homework on time. For next semester, you should find out of your institution has a disability support services (DSS) office (or something similar) and ask them what would be appropriate to put on the syllabus. My institution has specific phrasing for syllabi that communicates that the DSS office is the point of contact for any student that may require accommodation for a physical or mental health issue. You don't have to be ""disabled"", but they will coordinate things like having extra test time for students with dyslexia or severe test anxiety or being allowed to take an incomplete and make up missed work if they had an unexpected physical or mental health issue during the semester. Students who would like any academic accommodation need to register with DSS and fill out a form that says how the impairment impacts their ability to learn/work and what accommodations they are requesting. DSS reviews the form and then confirms what, if any, accommodations are appropriate. Some cases require a doctor to confirm diagnosis, some cases get approved but have conditions attached (extra exam time, but exam must be taken same day as the rest of the class; have longer deadlines for writing assignments, but must get tutoring at university writing center and have them sign off on assignments for them to be accepted late). It is the student's responsibility to give their professor(s) a copy of their approved accommodations, if they want to. They can get approved and NOT request accommodations, but the professor isn't required to give them any special consideration unless/until they are made aware of the approved accommodations. Professor has the discretion to decide whether they will allow retroactive accommodations for a student who didn't notify them until after the fact. Students are not obligated to disclose the nature of their ""disability"" to their professors and that info is not listed on the accommodation approval confirmation letter.
Might not be a bad idea to put the contact info for student health or student counseling on the syllabus and make a point of telling students that if they are having a medical or mental health issue during the semester (regardless of if they're registered for accommodations) that impacts their ability to complete an assignment, it is their responsibility to request an extension no later than the assignment due date and requests will be handled at your discretion on a case by case basis.",1,2019-12-20 03:53:41

These students have no excuse to email you for leniency.

fbfcvkj,t1_fbfahb3,True,jogam,t2_ca4tk,"I largely agree with your advice here, including providing information about counseling services on campus and how you'll go about accommodations. I do want to note that it's not quite so straightforward as the counseling center notifying a professor that a student needs accommodations, though:

1. Therapists in the counseling center are required to keep almost all client information confidential. They won't just call up the student's professor.

2. It can take time to come to a diagnosis. It can often take a student a couple of weeks to get a first appointment (university counseling centers are often booked out that far in advance), and a student might see their therapist every other week. So it could take a month or longer to get things into action when a student is in distress but not in imminent crisis.

3. After going to a counselor, there are really two avenues for a student to get accommodations. First is through the Dean of Students Office. This is typically for concerns that are more situational in nature. For example, if a student experienced the loss of a loved one in the middle of the semester, they may be experiencing substantial grief and be struggling academically. The Dean of Students Office can inform professors of the student's general situation (or confirm the details from a more official source) and encourage faculty to take the student's circumstances into consideration. The second is the college's accessibility services. A student typically needs a formal diagnosis for this, which takes time to get if they don't already have one. The system works alright for, say, a student with ADHD who needs extra time for exams, they've received the diagnosis prior to the semester, and they can seek out this accommodation from the beginning of the semester. For a student who experiences a mental health concern in the middle of the semester, it can take a almost whole semester to go through all the hoops to get accommodations.

I say this all because, while it's great for students to go to the counseling center and seek support, I also think it's important to recognize that getting access to enough counseling that it begins to help (e.g., a few sessions), medication, or academic accommodations can be a long and confusing process for students, and they may be struggling academically in the meantime.",1,2019-12-20 02:04:31

It did and still does mean the world to me that all of my professors responded with understanding and compassion and were willing to work with me so that I would not be put on academic suspension. But it was very much the case that they went out of their way to *not fail me*, not to give me an A I hadn't earned.

Those same professors were also honest and direct about the fact that I had in various ways failed to meet the expectations of the class, and that my final grade needed to reflect that. Just as much as I appreciated how kindly they responded when I reached out to them, I also genuinely appreciated and respected the fact that, while they were happy to bend where they could in order to help me, they weren't willing to throw their grading standards out the window just because I had been struggling. I had to withdraw from several classes and earned a C for the first time in my life, which really freaked me out; but also helped drive it home that I had brought this upon myself, *not* for having mental health issues in the first place, but for failing to reach out for the support I needed as soon as I realized that I was struggling. That was an important lesson for me to learn.

In terms of practical solutions, my professors dealt with this in different ways – some allowed me to take an incomplete and turn in all of the assignments I had missed over the summer, with a hit to my participation grade for the class time I had missed; some gave me a zero on the assignments I had failed to turn in, but were willing to weight the assignments I *had* turned in more heavily so that I could pass the class; some offered to switch me to pass/fail grading as long as I completed all of the work I had missed; some allowed me to withdraw from the class after the deadline to do so had already passed, to avoid having an F on my transcript.

But, again, in all of these cases I worked *very hard* to make up the work I had missed and then some, and even with all of that hard work, my transcript really suffered during those semesters. I was just relieved that I hadn't been suspended. I wouldn't have expected or frankly wanted full leniency when I knew full well that I had seriously messed up by not making arrangements with my professors from the get-go. If your students don't already feel that way, I do think that that's an important thing for them to understand.

I dealt with these issues myself for the first couple of terms of uni, but it became so bad for me that in my third term, I wasn't able to sit through any classes or exams without getting panic attacks, so I sought the advice of a doctor. At the time, we didn't know I was having panic attacks, but at the very least, it was documented. For that term, I was given an official withdrawal from my classes (after going through the appropriate channels).

It took me some time to find someone that could actually diagnose me (a psychiatrist) as my symptoms were just physical. Still, I was in seeing the doctors and following their advice. I didn't like doing this, but I knew I had to in order to be taken seriously, and to have a paper trail.

Once I was given my diagnosis, I went through the process of registering with the disability centre, where I was given accommodations to suit my needs. My professors are made aware of this at the beginning of each term, and I visit them to touch base.

Additionally, I was granted a retroactive withdrawal from my university (with the help of my psychiatrist and doctors) which means that I can ""withdraw"" from my second term of classes (which is almost 3 years ago now) because while I didn't see doctors until term 3, they agree I would have been suffering the same issues in term 2. 

If these students that e-mail you truly have mental health issues, these are the paths they can take. They need to start by seeking help at a university medical clinic. If it comes out that they do indeed have a condition that prevented them from doing well in your class, the school will take care of it for you. 

It seems nowadays everyone has ""mental health issues"" when it suits them. It does a disservice to all those who do suffer, as we are taken less seriously. Obviously I can't know the condition of the students that e-mail you, but directing them down the medical route helps everyone, and keeps grading fair.",1,2019-12-20 00:56:44

Could you offer an opportunity to do an extra credit assignment? Or maybe you could offer the whole class the option to re-do their lowest graded assignment? Or maybe, since so many people contacted you, you could offer to drop everyone in the class’ lowest grade? Or grade on a curve? Not sure. 

In the future you could build extra credit opportunities in to your syllabus so they know from the very beginning what their options are. You could also make it very clear to the students that you won’t be modifying grades last minute at the end of the semester. I went through a mental health breakdown during my degree, and did quite badly on some of my classes because of it. That said, I had an idea of how badly I was going to do way before the last week of class, so I asked for extra credit opportunities in advance. 

I had a professor who had system that I quite liked: There were 2 exams, 2 papers, and 2 presentations, and we had to pick 3 of these (we could do one of each, 2 exams and 1 paper, 2 papers and one exam, etc etc). We could choose which ones. If you did more than 3, only your highest 3 grades counted. Attendance and participation were also graded quite heavily.

So a step back and take something about education that is robustly true, which is class size.  People have done that experiment in all sorts of ways in all sorts of countries and with all kinds of teachers, ages and classes and smaller class sizes are overwhelmingly better at some order of magnitude . Very few results in education research are that robust.

Now, I say, giving practice HW is the best way.  So I give practice HW.  It seems reasonable.  If I give you questions, and you realize you don't know that, you can go look it up and know that?  But how do I actually tell if this is effective?  Some of them knew it anyway ,  Some of them didn't know it and didn't look it up (the questions are not magic, this is a process called formative assessments we are testing)  some of them just had their dog die, some of them are frankly not going to learn it no matter what you do.  So did it work?

Now lets move it to a lab, where they are selected for certain characteristics - no mental health issues, no major life issues and they have to be there for a certain amount of time with nothing but the questions and the book.  Now it works great!  But I take it back to the classroom and some them still dont learn it.

Maybe it depends on how good your questions are - maybe not all formative assessment are helpful, as a method, maybe just , um good ones, are.  So the teachers that write better questions are going to get better results, but they are also probably better teachers in other ways if they can do that also.

I also saw that you’re interested in neuroscience, which I get makes you worried about not getting a PhD. 

A bit of background, I’m from the US, currently doing my PhD in AUS. I came out of my undergrad degree in 2008 with a not terrible but not great GPA. I spent the next 6 years working full time and retaking some of my worst grades classes so that my gpa would get back up to grad school acceptance level. It probably would have gone faster, but I was the main money maker between my partner and I so I could only do one class at a time. Anyway, I found a medical research job at a Children’s Hospital. It was slightly outside my field (exercise science) but because I had research experience, It was a decent fit while I made money and boosted my gpa.  

Now, neuroscience is a bit more narrow, but don’t be afraid to look outside your field. Research in other areas is still research experience, and scholarships down here value experience first. You could also look for rehabilitation clinics for TBI/Strokes to see if they need help.

facfaqj,t1_fabqnq7,True,huckleberryfawn,t2_15f0wh,"This is tangential in this thread but I agree with you about community college classes in high school. I think that some of the kids enrolled are too young to understand some of the things they're asked to and that school administrators pursue dual-CC programs for the wrong reasons. I graduated from a poor rural US high school five years ago. The school didn't have the resources to offer AP or IB classes so they partnered with a community college from one of the state's larger cities so that students could take online classes to at least have some option for ""advanced"" courses (which, I'll be honest, I don't think is all that bad of an idea). 

 It was a decent community college and I personally enjoyed the courses I took, but I was an academically inclined student who ended up graduating from a four-year university. It was nice to have some variety since the high school, which graduated about 25 seniors a year, only offered the most basic graduation requirements like English I, II, III, algebra 1, biology, chemistry, health, government, etc. I never would've been able to take a Spanish, psychology, art history, and an advanced writing course in high school if it weren't for those dual-credit classes. The problem was in the school administration's handling of those courses and the students they allowed to enroll. 

Pretty much everyone who worked at my school including the faculty and administration had been first-generation college students from blue-collar rural families themselves. Rural schools, in my experience (all 14 years of my pre-K-12 education), don't tend to attract talent from elsewhere. The people that work in the schools, basically the only jobs in town you need a university education for, are people from that town who went off to college and then came back home. They have what I call the ""working class"" view of college. People with this view see college more as job training and a ticket to the middle class rather than as education. Our principal's view when I was in high school was that we just have to get the kids as many credits on paper as possible so that they'll be closer to a degree so that they can get a good job someday. There was no emphasis on them actually learning anything or doing well or acquiring the skills that undergraduate education should improve like ability to think critically, teach yourself new things, and manage time. 

They began offering this program while I was in high school. At the beginning of this dual-credit program, only academically high-achieving juniors and seniors could seek approval to take them, and that honestly worked pretty well. Kids like me were able to take some courses that were significantly harder than what the high school offered as college prep, not to mention the variety. Pretty soon, though, that working class mindset won out and they were allowing low-achieving freshmen to take those classes and there was even talk of allowing seventh and eighth graders into them, which I think the college itself had a problem with or it might have actually happened. 

These students hadn't taken English I yet and didn't grasp the concept of capitalizing the first word in the sentence and were suddenly thrust into a sophomore-level undergraduate writing course. Not to mention that they were fourteen years old in a class designed for adults. The particular English class that I took had a lot of writing assignments based on current events. I took it as an eighteen-year-old senior. I had some of my own opinions about politics and could think about the issues we wrote about with the mental capacity of a young adult, at least as well as an undergraduate. I think that in most cases, if a fourteen-year-old has a political opinion, they're most likely just parroting what their parents say. I don't think most kids that age even understand what things like abortion even are (given that they'd not even had high school sex ed yet), let alone be able to think critically about the arguments for or against. The point of thinking critically about issues and then writing logical arguments about them was completely lost on some of the kids I knew. They may have the credit for that class on their college transcript, but they probably would've gotten a lot more out of it had they taken it a few years later with the critical thinking skills and general knowledge of the world of an adult. (Which I don't think is all that fair to people they're competing with out in the world for jobs, internships, etc. who took a similar course as an actual undergraduate and probably actually learned something). It's the difference of having a credential on paper versus actually possessing the knowledge and skills the credential implies. 

I remember in those classes from the discussion board assignments that there were more high school students than actual undergraduates enrolled. There were some undergraduates that actually were primarily enrolled in the community college, but over half the class was high school students from rural schools radiating out about two hours driving time in every direction from the metro area where that community college was located. There were kids from every school that we played sports against. They were milking dozens of rural high schools in our area. They were a public non-profit college, but dang were they engaging in what I consider to be predatory practices targeting rural schools. They must've been getting a nice stream of revenue from the high school students. Our high school paid for students to take the courses, so there was no cost to students. They had to be rolling in the dough that originated from school taxpayer dollars rather than student financial aid (found them another tuition revenue honeypot, basically). I think behind the scenes they were probably marketing to the administrators to enroll more students.",1,2019-12-10 00:39:42

Related issue- I write pretty firm rules regarding when I will accept late assignments etc. in my syllabus and then seem to end up breaking them at least once or twice every semester. How exactly does one go about telling a student that no, I cannot accept your paper tardy even though your brother died...or you were diagnosed HIV+...or you are dealing with legal proceedings against your rapist...or you were evicted. All of these are real, true examples from just the last year by the way.

f9t3tqc,t3_e6lhor,True,ye_itsher,t2_x3t07,"My advice is to just withdraw from school and focus on yourself and your health until you're in a better place where you can focus on your education. It's not going to be the end of your life by leaving school and taking a break. I did it the first time I left uni, I was depressed and was not doing well in my classes even though I've always been a great student. I withdrew from all my classes near the end of the semester so ended up with W's for 5 classes that are still on my transcript. 

I went back to uni to finish my degree 2 years ago on my own terms and with my own money after having spent 3-4 years away from academia and working. I am much more motivated this time, I have a great GPA, great prospects, and planning on grad school when my undergrad is finished. 

Right now it seems like trying to force it to work with your current institution just isn't working, and in the process of trying to fix things and mitigate the damages, you're stressing yourself out more and it's probably not helping your physical or mental health. And your professors, if they actually said those things to you, make it seem like the school is not a great place to be. So moving on, getting your life together, then try again a year or two down the line is perfectly reasonable. You have a long life ahead and this is definitely an obstacle, but not life-ruining. So look at the big picture and evaluate your priorities, you might have to make some difficult decisions but always prioritize your health.",1,2019-12-06 04:51:58
f9t2aks,t1_f9rxbnx,True,biobennett,t2_390u2svv,"I went into molecular biology and only applied to 4 but worked my butt off on the applications and preparing for the interviews. I ended up contacting grad students and visiting some of the labs ahead of time to make connections too and ask about their research and was often introduced to some of the faculty. (Key here being I didn't contact the professor, grad student introduced me). It was a lot of fun talking to them about their research and it also helped me understand what the stress level and mental health of the average grad student was at the University.

In the end, I got into 2/4, but the choice was easy because I found the lab and the advisor I wanted to work for and a school culture and lab culture that would be healthy for me to be successful.

If you still want to do all the applications more power to you and there is some great advice in this thread. My advice is to get a bit creative and try things that other applicants won't, like going and connecting with the people, showing genuine interest in their research, asking for informational interviews with grad students and during them see if they can show you around the lab or department or whatever your situation is. 

If you end up only applying to 8, or even the full 11, make sure you put your full heart into each application. 

I only applied to 4 because I wanted to do the best I could on each application and my GRE. Kind of like the Ron Swanson advice.

As far as oversharing, I would say it depends. If the question is about adversity and the basis for your adversity was your mental health (preferably something clearly identifiable) then it seems to me it would make sense. But if it's more of a result of a hard situation, then that might be more oversharing. For example, if the adversity you faced was your dad dying and you struggled with mental health after that, that may be not be the best approach. That's sharing your inner emotions in a place that's not really the best for it. 

But if the issue were, for example, ADHD, and you trained yourself in techniques to overcome that difficulty and get medication, etc. Then that would be appropriate. 

The second would demonstrate a good ability to overcome adversity and not overshare something too personal, while the first, even if there was more to the story and you got through it, would not show that as much and would be a very personal thing.

One trick I've found is that the more ""reserved"" brits (and probably all academics in general) fare better in more personal conversations if you always include some actionable point in them. So you probably shouldn't focus just on the feelings side of things (e.g. ""I'm struggling to cope and am constantly depressed"") because there isn't anything for them to *do* and they might not know how to respond. Instead, you frame your struggles in terms of something actionable, something that they can *change*, like asking them to help you set deadlines or to find a quieter space for you to work. You can definitely mention the recent loss, PTSD, even the suicide attempt if you feel comfortable, but the conversation should be rounded out with a clear action that you'd like your PI to take. 

&gt;What do you mean by 'lean' on my supervisor?

I mean, don't treat them like a counsellor or offload all of your baggage onto them. If you're sitting in their office, crying and spilling all of your bad thoughts to them, that's getting into ""leaning"" territory - where you're relying on them for emotional support rather than professional. Many PIs honestly have bad mental health themselves so they can't be relied on for your emotional health, and if you do it too much or too often, they can get more stressed too. It's a lot of responsibility, your mental wellbeing, and your PI is woefully unprepared. 

Plus, they could respond in a very unhelpful way to your concerns. When I expressed my concern that I was the weakest student in my cohort and had the worst preparation, my PI *agreed* with me. And it wasn't because he's an asshole, it's because it was the truth and he was just addressing my statement from the professional, graduate school side of things.

If you find having the work helpful, you can still do it while on leave (there may be some restrictions on lab use); just a pace where it's not hurting you more.

  
You should also be able to get an extension through your university's wellbeing department (they like it if you apply &gt;6 in advance, but if you sent them basically this they should do it anyway); you'll probably have to talk a little about why you need it with them (which may not be pleasant, but they are supposed to be sensitive) and there should be a possibility of a paid extension.

* A master's in mental health counseling in a program that leads to licensure, which in most states would mean you could be a licensed practical counselor. Some of these programs may choose to give you credit for similar classes, but since most of your professional classes in clinical applications/therapy would be very different from research/experimental psychology, this probably wouldn't lop off much time.
* A master's in social work (MSW) and becoming a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW/LICSW). Takes about the same amount of time. Social workers have a little bit more flexibility in the kind of work they can get.
* A PhD in clinical or counseling psychology. You'd still be starting from pretty much scratch here - most doctoral programs likely wouldn't give you more than a semester's worth of ""credit"" for your master's.

She reported the professor to the chair because she missunderstood the tone of an email and took it as unnecessary cold. The chair then reported to the Dean, and she tried to have the Chair fired, because she felt it was a misplaced action. When this file didn't lead anywhere, we later learned that she tried to have the Dean fired by contacting the Board of Trustees. When that also failed she tried to go towards the journalism route bu that failed to. So she tried the lawsuit, but that didn't lead anywhere. 

She ignored the comments on her post, had her own storyline, cherry-picked the comments she liked to answer.

OP acknowledges that he may have misread the situation because of his disability, so he probably would have respected her if she had just made it known to him that she didn't have romantic feelings toward him.

Reddit is so confusing, everyone else here is telling me I'm too sympathetic. 

Anyway, I don't have anything against him personally at all. I am aware of students with extenuating circumstances and I also have a section on the syllabus about this. Here I say that I realize that a student have special circumstances - including, but not limited to, issues with health (physical or mental) and family. My policy as stated there is that the student needs to come to me as early as they can and, in return, I will make accommodations for them including personal tutorials and moving deadlines for them. I specifically say that this is best for the student because I cannot change their grades retroactively. 

To his credit, he contacted me relatively early (although I had already marked him as having likely dropped the class due to his absences) and I designed a new curriculum for him that required a minimum of attendance in the class (otherwise I have a relatively strict attendance policy) and other accommodations. He did not respond. I followed up on my own with him in person and I took the time to run the numbers to see what he needed to do and when to the grade he needed, and he accepted. When he was not able to do this specialized minimum amount of work, I followed-up via email, and he did not respond. 

One of the classes he had to attend was when I gave the midterm. He did not come and did not let me know before or after what the situation is. The issue is not that he is failing per se, but that he is failing by a very large margin due to him just not doing anything and not telling me anything about it, even when I make an overture. Surely a professional with a family has the organizational capabilities to tell his professor he's not going to show up for an exam or why he can't hand in an assignment? 

I understand students have extenuating circumstances, but he has to do a certain minimum and I don't even mean doing any work for the class at all, just letting me know what's going on. Sure, he has a lot going on, he has a job and young daughter and he needs to take this class even though it doesn't fit in his schedule. But surely he has the time to write me a few emails throughout the semester to even let me know what's going on.

He is entitled to do an EC assignment according to my own syllabus, but how much of my time and effort for special attention and accommodations is he entitled to? I would have met with him on my own time and tutored him to catch-up with the material, and he knows this. All that said, you are probably right that he is entitled and I have to let him do it, even if means more effort for me when he has done almost nothing on his end to work towards passing the class. I have had many non-traditional students and many with special circumstances, but I have never had a student who puts in so little for a class, he is getting a 22 (out of 100) right now.",1,2019-11-18 15:31:04

&gt;How many hours do you work on average per week/day?

Outside of class (I teach a 3/3 load which comes out to about 10 hrs/week of contact hours not including office hours) I spend about 1-2 hrs of prep for all three classes, and 1-2 hrs of admin/light grading (online posts, short homework, etc) about 3-4 days/week.

I teach mostly just language, and keep in mind that I've been doing that for many decades, so I don't need much language prep. Aside from photocopying, I could probably get away with just walking into a classroom and winging it. This was obviously NOT the case when I started as a grad student - I was spending up to 3 hrs/class for prep.

If I teach a lit course, it requires significantly more prep work. Every time you teach a repeat it gets easier of course. New courses take about 2-4 hrs/class day of prep work instead of  30-34 minutes.

&gt;What is your favorite part of being a foreign language professor? What is your least favorite part?

I enjoy teaching grammar, progress is very quantifiable and evident, when students progress they have an immediately applicable skill. Errors in language can be hilarious and can make class entertaining

Least favorite: Grading. Grading grading grading. And their misconception that plagiarism isn't a thing in foreign language essays.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;About what percent of your work time is devoted to each of your tasks?

1. You don't apply and you don't get accepted. Cost: giving up your dreams and more? Benefit: you can't get rejected; you don't spend any money, time, or effort applying.
2. You apply and get rejected. Cost: any money, time, and effort expended in applying; disappointment at rejection. Benefit: maybe that you'll have fewer regrets later in life?
3. You apply and get accepted. Cost: money, time, and effort spent applying. And all the trials and tribulations of graduate school, which many consider an ordeal. Benefit: you'll get to go to graduate school, which many consider a great opportunity.

You say that you're OK with rejection, so looking at this list, I think it's obvious that the worst possible outcome comes from not applying.

Also, most graduate programs won't let you graduate without a minimum GPA that's usually higher than a B average. You should be fine. (otherwise there's a grad admissions sub that might have more specific advice for your field.)  
2) You're a co-author on multiple papers and have relevant research experience.

3) Read up on ""Imposter syndrome"". You gotst it. 

You wouldn't be getting received well by faculty if they didn't think you were a good fit. If your grades are good enough for you to get into a graduate program (which they are, because you've already been through a master's degree), most professors don't really care about undergrad grades as long as you meet minimum admission requirements. If it requires the GRE for admissions, you may have to retake if you don't meet the minimum, but again, once an application gets to the professor's desk, that's likely not a deal breaker unless he's looking at multiple, otherwise near-identical applicants.

4) Are you getting on-going help for mental health issues? Suicide attempts are not typical responses to rejection, as much as rejection sucks (and graduate student suicides are still very much a problem, at least in the US, not sure about elsewhere). Your life is more important than a PhD, and grad school. Even once you get into a program and even if you're doing really well, there will be a lot of rejection (critical advisors, rejected papers, poorly received conference presentations.... ). None of that necessarily means you're doing poorly in your program, but it's hard to see beyond those negatives.  Just about everyone I know (myself included) has had their mental health take hits during grad programs, including a few who have had to take leaves of absence to recalibrate and get their health back in order. With your history--while not a red flag for a program application--make sure you're able to get the resources you need through campus from the start, so you can thrive in your program.

5) Just repeating #4. Make sure you're getting the help you need and will be able to continue getting it if you get into a program. It's really scary how casually you seem to mention multiple suicide attempts. Abuse and the trauma that stems from abuse is no joke. Make sure you're taking care of yourself first.

\- he asked you what was going on and offered help. You did not want it: you continued your behaviour of passively attending the course. In a music subject, that is quite problematic.

“Dear X,

Realistically, the transition to work from home has been rather difficult for me. Getting anything done is taking much more effort than it normally does, and my day-to-day motivation to do things is very low. I have an appointment with my psychologist next week and I am making positive strides toward getting things done but it is admittedly difficult. 

I think until I'm a little more stable with work from home, I'm hesitant to schedule a bunch of meetings.

Everyone has bad weeks. Everyone screws up. In those cases, I find the best approach is to be straight up and honest about the fact, but also remember to paint yourself in the best light possible. Emphasize where you've been putting your efforts, even if you didn't accomplish anything significant. Especially in this situation and at this early stage, your supervisor probably cares a lot more about your effort than your results.

A friend shifted from sociology &gt; wildlife biology, but before he entered his masters, he had a bunch of years of literally going-to-the-jungle-to-study-shit that made him a killer candidate. He had no problem getting a masters acceptance, even with a social science bachelors.

Keeping the university in the loop the whole time meant that I was never once penalized for it. We had a Disability service which I registered with, and that made it official that I had issues which needed to be accommodated for. I also had a personal tutor who was different than my thesis supervisor, and I kept him in the loop the whole time. This was crucial because due to the combined physical and mental health issues, I needed to apply for Special Circumstances every semester, and he could vouch for me because he had been following (my physical health was constantly changing so I kept him relatively updated). I also had a very chill thesis supervisor and it was important to keep him in the loop too.

fjocgqy,t3_fec9bk,True,TerriblePop,t2_3pdemfbo,"I have to go in the opposite direction as some of the other posters and say that I think it's a **good idea** to share this information with your advisor. A lot of what you wrote resonates with me personally. My advisor is also very ""chill,"" very laid back, and has never berated me for not turning things in on time, but it's that distance and the long leash that he keeps me on that has kept me going this entire time despite ups and downs psychologically and a close family member passing away during my time here.

It really boils down to your relationship with this faculty member. If you have a good working relationship at a baseline, a bit of self-disclosure can actually ***enhance*** a relationship and draw two people closer because vulnerability **enhances** **trust**, it doesn't divide. Which can be energizing and actually keep you from sliding into anxiety. Take the other side of the coin. You turn in work late and seem to be struggling with something, but the advisor can't tell what. So they start making assumptions without context, and those assumptions are confirmed by ""evidence"" that your advisor observes.

Think about this with your friends. You know a lot about your close friends' personal details, and vice versa. You know how many siblings they have, whether or not their parents are divorced, and what kind of food they like. Acquaintances, probably you know less, maybe only a few details. Strangers, don't know anything at all. I'm not saying your advisor has to be your best friend, but it is not a relationship like with an acquaintance.

The PhD is an even longer and more stressful road than the MS (which is stressful enough). If you work with this advisor for your PhD, wouldn't you rather figure out if they're an ass early on when you only have a brief time to complete your Master's thesis, rather than be halfway through your PhD?

I'm not saying let all of your skeletons out of the closet or share your most intimate, darkest secrets, but giving a mentor some context - however vague - can be helpful. As I said, sharing vulnerabilities is a leap of faith that sometimes pays very rich dividends. My advisor knows that I am seeing a counselor and from time to time he will ask ""how are you feeling about everything?"" to check in. It's not much, but it is very helpful to me to know that he's got my back.

Edit: I will add that my campus has taken many measures from the top down and bottom up to raise awareness of mental health and try and shift the cultural narrative. I personally think that falling in line just because it's what everybody does is understandable, but doesn't do anything to shift the cultural narrative. Again, it doesn't have to be all (screaming your problems from the rooftops) or nothing (abject silence). It's a continuum.",1,2020-03-06 20:03:01

I started with Mathematics and Physics but was initially somewhat interested in the philosophy behind the sciences and how we rationally justified using the systems and philosophical thought we did, but that rarely gets discussed, rather just assumed. When trying to understand the universe, I failed my degree due to mental health issues and questioned: how can I understand the world without understanding the biological and psychological lens through which I'm looking at it, or the foundations for the tools I'm using to understand it like logic, linguistics, etc. Understanding why we've developed such psychological tools can be deepened through studying artificial intelligence and evolutionary psychology, etc. The kattter of which is itsel somewhat explained by game theory and principles found in machine learning, etc. Psychology is obviously tied into neuroscience, which is itself somewhat tied into computer science, biology and information theory, etc. Psychology amongst many other things seems to feed into criminology, philosophy, economics, education, politics, languages, religion, ethics, etc. Honestly it all just goes on and on and on in an enormous graph that makes you question the utility of the nodes in the first place.

But for me, fun wasn't enough. The work didn't feel useful, helpful, or fulfilling, regardless of how intellectually stimulating it was (I did physics). So I left and pursued more meaningful things (now I'm pursuing cognitive and mental health sciences).

Someone even commented that they have to be allowed to come to class sick because, with their disability, they would miss too much classtime otherwise. So, doesn't the same logic apply to a mental health disability?

Seeing as I never made that argument, I wouldn't know.  I do know that the ADA requires schools to make **reasonable** accommodations for disabilities.  Knowingly exposing the faculty, students and staff to a person known to be volatile, vindictive and unhinged is not, in any way, a reasonable accommodation.



&gt; Can a grad. program reject a student because they have a known mental health disability that may affect their work and/or conduct (by definition a mental illness will affect at least one of the two). 

Not sure, but they **can** reject an applicant based on a lack of confidence that said applicant will be a good, functional member of the department.  Would you say that you've created a good case for you as a good, functional member of the department?   (Warning - this isn't one of those 'there are no wrong answers' type situations.)

&gt; I disagree that even a student without mental health issues should be rejected because they filed a complaint (and felt guilty and tried to rescind it yet)

You seem to be under the impression that some applicants (such as yourself) are entitled to positions within programs, and can only have their applications rejected if certain disqualifying criteria are met.  This has no correlation whatsoever with the truth.  It is up to the applicant to make the case that they would be a positive addition to the program.  Would you say that you have done this?  (Warning - this isn't one of those 'there are no wrong answers' type situations.)

&gt; but when mental health is involved, doesn't it become discrimination against a disability?

Only if it's a recognized disability, with documentation, where the disabled student has made a reasonable effort to mitigate the disability's impact on their own experience, and reasonable accommodation by the institution can get you the rest of the way there.  By analogy, if your disability were that you had lost the use of your legs, you would have had to avail yourself of readily available assistive technologies (such as a wheelchair) and made the school aware of further needs (such as housing with universal access to facilities and classes that don't require navigating staircases) before they became a crisis.  Translating your situation to this analogy, you, instead, refused to try and find a wheelchair that works for you because the first one you tried didn't fit your body, then threw yourself down the stairs, wallowed in your own waste for a while, and threatened to sue the school when they acted as though this was not a problem of their own making.  See the difference?  (Warning - this isn't one of those 'there are no wrong answers' type situations.)

&gt; Regardless, this department doesn't seem to be a good fit for me, 

You're so close to figuring this out.  **You** are not a good fit for further academic work until you get your personal life sorted out.  You will also have an extremely difficult time ever achieving admission into a program anywhere, as no reference from your undergraduate institution will do anything but warn the admissions committee to reject your application out of hand.

&gt; but not wanting to move, this university is my only choice. (And even if moving is required for academia, I cold at least strive for a master's degree and then decide if I want to further pursue the academic career path.)

**NO**.

If someone has a mental health disability that results in them having explosive anger issues, even if they're not violent or damaging anything, that's still a very good reason not to hire them. Their behaviour when angry and the way they blow up at minor infractions would alienate their colleagues, make them difficult to work with (having to ""walk on eggshells""), and overall destroy the collegiate atmosphere of the workplace. People wouldn't want to work with them, talk to them, even be in the same room as them. Students would feel uncomfortable and be subjected to unfair stress in managing their lecturer's mental illness as they would have to change their behaviour in **unreasonable** ways. 

The university would not be required or even expected to hire that person. Their disability affects *others* in very negative ways, and all accommodations that can be made are similarly unreasonable. 

You will not be accepted or hired because your disability currently makes you unfit to work. You have reasons for the way you behaved but they are not excuses, you are not excused, you are not forgiven, and these beliefs/behaviours will not be tolerated.

I don't know that I""ve been ""black-booked"" by the university (or if that would even be legal for them to do). I think I'd be depressed and distracted by the absence of my former professor, and the overall environment would be awkward (i.e. running into or having to interact with the chair), but if I'm an otherwise strong candidate (and this time I won't devote my entire statement of purpose to a retiring professor), they couldn't discriminate or retaliate against me. The question is whether it's worth immersing myself in that environment. Ironically, being in graduate school would mean having better access to mental health services (i.e student health insurance, income from a T.A. or R.A. position etc.). Plus, having a supportive cohort may offset some of these issues with the faculty. Even if it's not the ""ideal"" environment, it's not like I would be living with these faculty members. Once classes, meetings, etc. are over, I can leave it behind (and still be in this city). 

&gt; it'll be impossible to avoid absolutely *all* flights during your career, 

I understand that I'll probably have to travel at  some point, but is frequent (or long distance/international) travel a requirement? Even though it's enriching/beneficial to meet others in your field, are these trips a requirement in the sense that teaching a certain number of hours is, etc.? I was also thinking more along the lines of grad. school (even at the master's level). If an advisor suggests that you present at a certain conference, can you decline (or request to only attend local ones?) They may think it's weird, but would most be willing to continue working with you? 

&gt; believing an A- paper was bad 

I wish this was a case of anxiety/neurosis, but the professor implied in her feedback that the grade was generously given. Besides saying that I earned ""28/30 points-*a very good result* (emphasis mine), her general comments were that it had a ""clear thesis"" (not a brilliant or creative one, etc. \[though she did refer to it as ""good"" in the comments within the paper itself\]), was ""organized coherently"" (not ""very well organized""), and that ""if I wanted to do anything more with it in the future, I would have to ""correct the numerous spelling and other common errors throughout."" (Again, I could barely concentrate while writing it, but she didn't know that.) Based on this feedback, it was, at best, a mediocre paper. (I'll probably create a separate post for it.)

Either way, I don't have the reference from  her. (Though had the paper turned out better, I wouldn't have even submitted the proposal and none of the subsequent events would have happened.) In most cases, this could be solved by signing up for another course and proving that I could produce better work. However, I can't afford to do that. (Then there's the added stress of negativity within the dept., but on second thought, maybe this would be a good way to build a rapport with a new professor.) 

&gt; You're not allowed to cancel just because someone is sniffing. If you insisted on doing this, you would likely be fired. 

I wouldn't cancel the entire class because someone sniffled. I plan on keeping a box of sterile masks in the class (and this  goes for any educational position I have, T.A. or even teaching high school in the meantime etc.), and if someone sneezed, coughed more than once, sniffled, etc., I'd ask them to wear a mask. (If they refused, then I'd ask them to leave.) However, if someone comes in exhibiting full-blown flu or cold symptoms, then I would want them to leave. They are disrupting the class by risking getting others sick, plus there might be other students with anxiety about it. 

With that said, I'm going to consider this feedback. If it was an easy decision, I wouldn't be posting about it. I'm torn between loving my field/research, not really seeing myself in a more ""traditional job"" (I was self employed before attending college) ,and knowing how incompatible academia may be with my anxiety.",1,2019-11-07 05:26:43

&gt;I love my city too much to permanently relocate,

Incompatible.

You **must** relocate in order to pursue graduate studies (since you've been black-booked by the only uni in your area). If you do that then you'll **have** to move again for a postdoc or permanent position, and again, neither will be in your area. You will not be hired by your undergraduate alma mater. You cannot work in academia in that city. This is non-negotiable for you now. 

&gt;I'm afraid of flying.

Incompatible.

While we should all try to limit our flying, it's still an important part of academia and it'll be impossible to avoid *all* flights. Not only that, but you seem to have a problem with being away from home, so regardless of how you get there (train, car, cycling), you're going to have issues. Academics travel in order to talk to others in their field. You cannot expect others to always travel to you, you usually need to meet them halfway. 

&gt;I become easily stressed.

Incompatible.

Normally this wouldn't be too serious an issue as long as the person was prepared and knew their limits. But you have **severe** mental illness and you displayed completely abhorrent behaviour in only a ""reasonably"" stressful situation (believing an A- paper was bad, uncertain housing, misreading the tone of an email). Your life as an academic will be far more stressful most of the time, especially during graduate school and your early career. You have absolutely no evidence that you can handle this stress and all the evidence to prove otherwise. DRC accommodations only need to be ""reasonable"", and if your accommodations require that you not be subjected to stress, that's a pretty damn unreasonable expectation. Your illness is your responsibility and graduate programs/jobs cannot be endlessly adapted for your illness. It harms the university/workplace when you behave irrationally.

f6m8l09,t3_drt7ro,True,HumanDrinkingTea,t2_o4xhq,"For some background, I have a music degree and am now a STEM major. While music isn't quite theatre, it does have some similarities to theatre that makethem both distinct from STEM majors. I have also worked in the professional world as a musician. 

Here's the thing: I agree with others that he was unnecessarily harsh. However, he likely *was* saying something that you really needed to hear, and chances are that he just didn't know how to say it in a way that wasn't harsh.

&gt;  he pointed out at the time that he knew he was being aggressive but he was just trying to help make sure I didn't make a mistake with my life or something like that

I went to a fairly competitive music school. This school also had a theatre and musical theatre department that were among the top programs in the country. Doing what you did would have been an automatic F in any of the performance-based classes in any of these majors at my school, in absence of official documentation from the school's disabilities office (note that this is a different office than the counseling office). Here's the thing:

&gt;  I had to go my school's counselling services before the class, and it ran through the class, so I missed it.

It sounds like you could have looked at your watch, interrupted your therapist, and said ""got to go, bye."" He doesn't know you were having a mental health crisis-- he can *only* know this if he gets official documentation from the disability office, and it does not sound like you did this. Absent of this knowledge, he expects you to drop what you're doing and run to class if you need to, because that is the professional standard in the performing arts fields. 

Sure, your class didn't have these ""automatic F"" policies, but he surely knows that other schools do. The reason that other schools do is because in the professional world, if you miss a single performance or rehearsal and don't hire a sub, you are blacklisted-- you will never get work again. Getting an F in a college class is a lot less harsh than the ""real world"" ramifications of not showing up. Other people rely on you being there. 

It is hard to overemphasize how important showing up is in the performing arts is. Your professor was trying to communicate to you how incredibly unacceptable it is to miss a performance-based class. Just because you're not ""interested"" in acting isn't an excuse. You are on the books as a theatre major, so you will be held to the standards of a theatre major. 

The culture of STEM is very, *very* different. It was a shock to me when I changed fields. You have to be mindful of this and realize that you cannot assume that something that is acceptable in STEM classes is acceptable in theatre classes, or vice-versa. 

The bottom line is that your professor was speaking from years of experience and was seriously concerned about your future. It was honestly a kindness for him to have a talk with you, because he probably see's many, many students screw their futures with flakiness. Not saying that you were flaky-- it sounds like you were having legitimate issues, but the professor didn't know that at the time, so he had every reason to believe that you were being irresponsible. Again, just *being* at the counseling office isn't an excuse-- the proper department to go through if you're missing class for health reasons is the school's disability services. 

&gt;  I think he thought I was okay with it.

He knew you weren't okay with it, but sometimes people need to be told things they don't want to hear. Moral of the story? Do everything within your power to avoid missing theatre classes. Now that your mental health issues are diagnosed, you can go through disability services and have that open dialogue with your professors. 

Many students, unfortunately, are straight up delusional about their chances of success. If you aren't at a school that is competitive, then this may be a problem at your school. With your STEM major, it is not something you should worry about, but your professor is probably tired of seeing students graduate in debt with no career prospects. Your professor is telling you things he knows you don't want to hear, because he thinks that it will help you make better decisions in the future. 

What your professor lacks is proper communication skills, most likely. You should, however, consider that there is a legitimate reason that your professor chose to act like he did. Sure, he was a jerk about it. But that doesn't mean he did to *be* a jerk. It really sounds like he did it to give you a dose of reality. 

Here's how he *should* have communicated his concerns:

&gt; I want you to succeed in the future, and I want you to be the best ""you"" that you can possibly be. Unfortunately, your attendance and performance this semester have been subpar, and if this trend continues, I fear that you will struggle in this profession. What can we do to address this problem?

Notice that this communicates the same ideas he was trying to get across, but in a non-asshole way.

Almost everyone has had stuff stolen. It sucks. It can make one feel helpless, victimized, traumatized. Nobody doubts that. And most people's undergraduate years are a tempest of one sort of another. It's a tricky time of one's life. 

But this sort of thing will continue for the next 5-8 years in your life. Are you intellectually mature enough? This is a question you should ask yourself. (I do not know you, so I can't say. But you seem to blame all of your difficulties on external forces. This is generally _not_ a sign of maturity. You must take some serious responsibility for your own habits, issues, etc., if you are going to hope to overcome them.) 

This is a more important question than you GPA; if you are still prone to major difficulties with anxiety, commitment, whatever, then grad school is probably going to make these things _worse_, not better.

I generally recommend undergraduates have at least a year away from school (working in a job, etc.) to think about whether they really want to go back to school.

(Don’t matter if your crushing it- looking down or drowning-looking up).  Hope is a funny illusion we all have because truth be told, until you get your doctoral degree- you are still very vulnerable. Overworked with minimal securities. And that’s discouraging. I like to say works comes in waves- you work over time then decompress (then repeat).  Very few people understand the true inner workings of what it takes to get a PhD. So I respect you reaching out for advice. 

As far as advice. Routines. Most people overestimate what they can do in a single day, but drastically underestimate what they can do in months/years. To get an idea... create a “to did list” where at the end of the day- write everything you have accomplished to get an idea of what’s feasible. Wake up a set time and just read something. Some focus on 60 minutes of writing a day, I find it better to just have a set time of the day 9-10am is dedicated to just “research- read/write/stats/figures/anything else. Also- make short and long term “progress goals” as opposed to “outcome goals”. What I mean... I will dedicate 30 min/5 days a week on my dissertation as opposed to- I will finish my dissertation in 3 months. The former you can measure as time goes on. 

Affirmations- no joke. Start hijacking the subconscious mind. More than “I feel great, I am great, I will succeed”. Think more “One day closer to becoming Dr.______”.... as a significant other the best you can do is clear the mind and feed the soul. Unless you’re in the same field and can offer intellectual insights. Some showing affirmations are best time right before bed or after after waking up. 

Since I do research on cardiovascular function- there is indeed merit to exercising.  Caught in a funk- switch it up and do something different. Hike, walk, bike ride, have more sex, anything physical. Life is about perspective. Immediately changing your environment can have a positive domino effect to get back on track. 

And finally- make sure mental/physical health is in check. I know too many souls victimized by the educational system demands that honestly end up so much happier/healthier when they leave. Short term solution at the cost of long term goal IMO. But hell what do I know- I could easily be in the same boat as your BF (only if I let myself). I would suggest if. leaving is the best option- make sure there is something more promising to immediately start.

Unless the student had very specific formal accommodations in place that determined how they should be treated by staff (and I've never heard of one that came anywhere close to ""must treat with kiddie gloves and accept all apologies to the student's personally desired level of apparent sincerity) then there is no reason why there would any repercussions on the professor. To go back to my abusive partner comparison, if you want to leave a relationship but the other person says they are depressed and you leaving will make it worse are you then compelled to stay? No. That would be toxic as hell.

Someone having mental health issues isn't their fault, but it *is* their responsibility. And they can't demand others take more responsibility for managing it than they do themselves.

If a student has any issues that impair their learning they should seek out the relevant disability services and arrange any accommodations that are necessary and proportionate. From a legal perspective reasonable accommodations should be made, but they must first be *sought*, and again, I stress the word *reasonable*.

An apology isn't meant to be for the benefit of the one apologising. This isn't just relevant here, it is true in all walks of life.

Real talk time: Given your dogged responses to this post I took a look at your post history. And ooh boy. Enough people have told you that what you did with your professor, chair and dean was wrong, and I'm not going to retread old ground. And I'm not a psychiatrist, much less your psychiatrist, so I'm not going to go into your specific mental health concerns.

But straight up, on an intellectual level, you need to understand that your impression of academia and how people within it should act and treat one another (and I suspect this would extend to the rest of the world should you join the non-academic workforce) is very *very* off. Whether you feel it or not, you need to *know* that your expectations do not align with reality and other people's perceptions. 

You may invest a lot emotionally in some people\*, or your idea of those people, but you aren't owed the same in return. As long as someone treats you with civility you can expect nothing more from them. This will be true in school/college/grad school/business or industry. When you try and force it you make things worse. And when you demand that they accept your apology you make it abundantly clear that you are apologising because you want forgiveness, and you want to feel better, not because you want them to feel better. You should know this by now. And mental health might get you some understanding, but it doesn't get you a free pass, nor can you use it to get your way.

However, I feel I need to complete a significant project that will demonstrate my potential for graduate school (and ideally collaborate with a faculty member so I can earn a strong letter of recommendation). Since my proposal was accepted for presentation at an academic conference, it must be viable. So, would a faculty member typically agree to work with a student (alumni, in my case) on a smaller scale project?

Regarding my relationship with the professor:

&gt;It would have gotten back to her anyway, and your relationship would have been ruined either way.

The situation is even worse than what's described because I didn't just mention this one email but a couple of others where her tone seemed to change. However, I likely misinterpreted those too. I've tried arduously to rectify the situation, but so far my efforts have been to no avail. Besides complaining about the chair, I've explained to each level of administration (and now the Board of Regents) that I overreacted due to a mental health condition and requested that any consequences to her be reversed (and any record of this in personnel file removed). Yet, so far everyone has sided with the chair and closed my case. (I'm hoping the Board of Regent will be able to help me.) What makes this most difficult for me is that this professor has since retired, and I'll never have the chance to reconcile with her now. It's not even that I want a letter of recommendation from her; I sincerely admired her and at times am overwhelmed with guilt over this.

I still hold the chair responsible, however, because students often write in an emotional/upset state and sometimes just need some time to calm down. He could have encouraged me to communicate with her without telling her (or other faculty) about the email. (I'd probably feel just as guilty for writing it, however.)

&gt; You're not going to get a reference from anyone in that department 

Perhaps not, but would it still look bad if I had positive letters from professors in other departments? (I was an interdisciplinary major.)",0,2019-10-24 03:31:40

I’ll echo the primary advice above: Get counselling.

YOU are the most important thing here. Way more important than your course. You cannot expect to look after your learning if you cannot look after yourself first.

Secondly. Seriously consider taking a year out. Deferring for a year is a fairly common occurence: a fair few students will do it each year and there’s straightforward procedures in place to accommodate it (at least in the UK).

So, think about this. How does the idea of just dropping it all feel to you? Just not going to your next lectures or anything. Just stopping all the uni work? If the thought of this brings feelings of relief, then do it. Arrange to just start the final year in 2020. It’s not a failure to do this. It can, for many students, be necessary self care.

It’s not always the right solution for every student. Sometimes the idea of putting it all off is a source of anxiety rather than just getting it done. But, in my experience, deferring for a year can be really vital for many students.

Especially so if you are new to dealing with mental health issues: It can help to have space to get a handle on your mental health, learn coping mechanisms and strategies, work out what meds work etc. This takes t8me that cannot be done alongside a full course of learning and assessment etc.",1,2019-10-23 10:23:54

You asked how honest you should be, and I agree it's worth considering how much detail you'd like to share with your professor. You can note that you experienced a serious health concern broadly, share that it was a mental health concern specifically, or choose to share that you were grappling with addiction. You can share that you spent the summer putting a lot of time, effort, and energy into your recovery and that you're in a better place. 

There's not a right or wrong amount of information to share. I do think it's worth considering that there are pros and cons to sharing less or more. A potential pro is that the more information he has, the more he can consider it to understand what was going on for you (especially knowing that your mental health concerns were very serious). A potential con is that there is considerable stigma about mental health concerns, and that that could further color how your professor views you depending on his views. It's also up to you how much you feel comfortable sharing (you shouldn't feel pressure to share anything you don't want to). 

As far as rebuilding trust, you may have to accept that you have lost his trust (or some of his trust). You're not taking more classes with him, and I would not recommend taking on more projects at this point in time, so it is what it is. Hopefully, your other experiences outside of the summer left a strong positive impression. And he may take what you went through into consideration, too. Also, honesty and opening up can build trust; your meeting with him to share what you experienced while also acknowledging and apologizing for your mistakes is a good first step.

It sounds like you're being hard on yourself. I get that--I probably would be too if I were in your shoes. But I also hope you can have some self-compassion for yourself. Mental health concerns are serious, and it's not your fault for experiencing them. It sounds like you took initiative to get treatment and have been actively engaged with that. It's unfortunate that that affected your summer project, certainly. But life happens and it sounds like you're doing the best that you can to get back on your feet.

After that, it's up to him to be understanding/forgiving, and this will depend on his character. If he's not, then he's unempathetic and probably not someone you'd want to work with. However, if you don't explain your behavior, then he's left to draw his own conclusions as to why you ghosted him on the project...and they're probably not very good ones. All you can do at this point is try. Also, you don't have to share any details that you're uncomfortable sharing. You could simply say you were struggling  with mental health (or even just health) issues and offer to provide a medical note.

That aside, I think the most poignant thing you need to be asking yourself is: why do you want to go to grad school? Are you passionate about your field? Do you have a specific research goal in mind? If you are not absolutely burning with passion for the subject I seriously urge you to reconsider. Just because a position is presenting itself to you does not mean it is the right thing for you. If it’s just burnout, and you are still passionate, take a gap year. If the position is a good fit for you, it will still exist in the future, and if it doesn’t, you will find another opportunity.

And I don’t mean to be a dick with this next point, but I need to throw out some tough love here: if you are struggling this much with undergraduate coursework, are you prepared (both intellectually and study skills) for grad school?

1. Address your mental health.
2. Really think about where your passion lies.

Okay also, there is a third thing but honestly, I don’t think this needs to be said because you’ve made it to your senior year and you are obviously bright and diligent but:
3. Keep working hard in your courses. Advanced coursework is hard. You can’t be great at everything. Do your best, meet with your profs, and don’t stretch yourself too thin. Keep going.

Ultimately I think it matters little whether one has a partner or not, but it’s important to protect your own mental health.

I don't think the number of hours you work will be what matters so much as the experience you have and the quality of a letter of recommendation you might get.

2. Does your college have career center services available to recent graduates? If so, I'd recommend seeing if they can help you find jobs at community mental health agencies or other relevant places. (Likewise, they may be of some help in finding RA positions.)

3. While clinical psychology Ph.D. programs are, of course, highly competitive, it is possible that you are underestimating your strength as an applicant. I did not have any publications when I applied for graduate schools. If your application checks out in other areas (e.g., still having research experience, strong GPA and GRE scores, strong LORs, etc.), getting an RA position may not be essential to your application (though of course, it still would help).

4. If you're getting a large number of interviews but not receiving any job offers, you might consider doing a mock interview with someone (again, consider seeing if this is a service your college's career center offers to recent alumni).

1. How much of a time commitment is this? Doing 10 or so hours per week as a volunteer (and being able to hold a job on top of it) to gain additional research experience before applying to graduate schools may be worthwhile, particularly if you don't have a lot of research experience to-date. If we're talking full-time 40 hours per week, I would consider it completely unreasonable to expect someone with a Bachelor's degree to put in that amount of labor without compensation. (By the way, when they say they may at some point pay you, I would operate under the assumption that that will not happen.)

2. Consider looking for jobs that may have connections to the clinical side of your interests, for example, at community mental health organizations or other relevant nonprofits. That is a way to both pay the bills and continue gaining experience that will strengthen your graduate school applications.

3. If you don't have a lot of research experience, one potential avenue would be to complete a Masters program first. That way, you can gain research experience as a graduate student, and apply for Ph.D. programs as a stronger candidate with more research experience under your belt.

4. It sounds like you're experiencing some success looking for paid positions (congrats on the interview yesterday!). Certainly, a paid RA position would be a good option. If you're getting to the interview round, odds are that you're a good candidate for these types of positions. If you haven't already done so, consider seeing if there is someone who can look over your materials and rehearse interview questions with you to give you some feedback.

I was surprised that I even got an interview. My grades are pretty decent sure, but I didn't have any publications to my name, and hadn't worked in a lab outside my BSc and MSc projects.

There is no doubt that I would have made a good fit in the lab itself - my research interests aligned very well what what they do - which may be why I was interviewed. I can't say whether or not I would have fit in *socially,* and will never know. 

I gather that one of the best skills you could have for Oxbridge is what my supervisor calls the ""bullshit meter"". Essentially, if you can critically analyse other studies and say why they are poor (could be design, analysis... anything really), they REALLY like that at Oxbridge. It seems to be (whether rightly or wrongly) that Oxbridge make the standard. They tell you what they do, and why everyone should do it, and you're incorrect otherwise. I don't mean to sound bitter FYI, but I have noticed this with other universities of similar prestige (my supervisor experienced this first hand in his PhD). 

In terms of groundbreaking work, I guess it comes down a lot to the collaborations and work ethic that Oxbridge has formed. Let's face it - not everyone is an Einstein, but through work with other researchers etc, maybe you'll be part of a group that is as smart. 

I am almost certain that those that attend universities like Oxbridge will have similar struggles to those in other places - certainly cost of living is much higher than in other parts of the UK, and there will be more internalised pressure to do well which is likely to affect mental health. 

I don't think there is a particular TYPE of person that Oxbridge will avoid - certainly it will attract certain types of applicants anyway (good GPA, hard worker etc).

It sounds like you have put all your eggs into your education basket and now you don't know what your life is about. You need to go and figure that out. Those recommending therapy are likely spot on.

My own 2 cents on what it is to live a good life:

Work the Body.  Be physically active and have physical goals you work towards. For many this can be sports, yoga, martial arts, running, biking, hiking. You get a social bonus if things involve a group. Physical health improves mental health. This also means eating healthy too.

Work the Mind. Have meaningful conversations. Play challenging games with people. Write. Read. Be creative with art or crafts. Meditate. Get therapy. Keeping the mind active promotes health.

Be Productive. Productivity with the goal to acquire an art or skill allows for a sense of accomplishment. Making things to enjoy or for others, making art, doing things with your hands can be intrinsically rewarding and entertaining in ways that video games and other activities are not. Even cleaning or gardening can be satisfying for some. For some, this may be their careers or volunteer work. A small sense of accomplishment now and then does wonders for esteem.

Belong. Belong to a group or community. Maybe this is a sports group, gamer group, social group. You need time spent socializing with someone around an interest or due to family or friendly bonds. Humans are social animals and we are meant to have a tribe.

Lastly, strike a balance between the physical, mental, social, and productive aspects of your life. This will need to be re-tailored again and again and again. It's hard to live a good life, but I doubt there is another way to it. You don't have to have it all together all the time, and life changes always.

The first two mentors I got involved with just by approaching them to help with their research because it's interesting to me (mental health and psychiatry at a population level).

If you know you are miserable, don't have a good working relationship with advisors/your committee, don't see yourself as a chemical engineer, and aren't performing well, now is the best time to leave. Don't fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy. You absolutely do not have to be miserable in grad school, and feeling awful is not a prerequisite to success. 

I think the answer to your first question is no. Other posters have said you won't need more pre-reqs, so consider taking some grad level courses as a non-degree student to make up for your subpar grades this semester. Make sure your mental health struggles are documented so you can submit those in explanation as well.

See if you can get a research assistant type job while you get your mental health under control and prepare to apply to new programs. This will give you experience and the ability to write something like ""I thought I was interested in ChE due to my work on XYZ in undergrad. However, after exploring \[drug synthesis/pharmaceutical technology\] while working in X Laboratories, I now know I am most excited about answering research questions about ABC."" But again, I don't know the field, so this may be stupid advice. 

In my opinion, you can treat this all as a learning experience. You're very young, and now you know more about what type of work you want to do and what type of work environment you need. I think you will have more success if you leave now, pull yourself together, and start somewhere new than if you slog through this program doing poorly because you are uninterested in the work and ineffectively supported.

That being said, it’s so important to establish a good work and life balance early on. It’s good to be enthusiastic about your work, but if you don’t take time to relax after working 10 hour days (or more) you won’t be able to continue that kind of work for long. I find that spending time with lab members outside of work is a great way to unwind because they can also relate to the daily stresses that you’re going through. Plus, it helps to establish great relationships with the people that you’ll spend most of your time with.

So yes, it’s normal to feel totally exhausted on a daily or weekly basis, just make sure you take a couple hours a day to just do something that you don’t need to use a ton of brainpower for, or something that you enjoy. Also, I’ve more recently found that forcing exercise into my routine in the morning is a great habit to get into. Even if it’s 30min sessions a day, it’s an easy and non-time consuming way to blow off steam and boost your confidence.

Additionally, I see a school mental health counselor biweekly as a preventative measure. Most grad student do develop mental health problems and many of them end up quitting because of it. Staying ahead of your mental health by seeing a therapist is a smart thing to do, even if you don’t feel like you need to do it, I highly recommend this.

Hang in there and don’t be afraid to share your concerns with others as well-everyone goes through it and you can try what other people do to maintain their sanity.

I've lived in multiple places, cities, towns, suburbs both as an adult and a child. I also have a wonderful partner - we worked on grad school together (MA for them; MA + PhD for me). I've also struggled with mental health before/during/after grad school. 

Here's my complaint: I love where I live now. My partner's job is AWESOME - they lucked into it - we really didn't think this sort of job existed. I'm the healthiest I've been in years, mentally and physically. Same with my partner. I love the arts and culture of where I live, the social events, where I live, the friends I've made (some/most are from outside work, too!). The only thing wrong with the whole thing is my job is visiting and it's year 3 of a 3-year contract. I know the longer I wait, the less desirable I'll be as a candidate, but I've kept up publishing and service in my visiting role. I apply to open jobs in my region if/when I can, but nothing permanent has panned out for me there. :( 

I had a nice on-campus visit last week and would really consider the offer if it was extended to me. I had a phone interview last week for a place that seems pretty great, too. Both locations appear to have jobs for
my partner in the region. But if/when something should work out for me on the TT job market, I will seriously mourn leaving this place. I don't want to go. I have had so many thoughts of giving up, looking alt-ac, just so I can stay here. I know I can start over again. I know I would come to love somewhere else. I don't know about my mental health in a new city, but worst case I know I can find resources and make the most of it. When I've lived elsewhere, the infrastructure/location/commute/lifestyle all got old, but the people made it worth it. Here, it's the Goldilocks combination for everything but my job prospects - the city is a perfect size and location for us, the partner's job is perfect for them, and I love the friends I've made.

You're not an independent worker like a Postdoc, who collaborates with the PI on themes but can define their own scope to a much broader extent. You're a trainee who is receiving instruction in ""how to science"". An advanced trainee, but a trainee nonetheless. Your first goal has to be to publish as much as possible, your second goal is to get your thesis done in a reasonable time. All of this is assuming you'll want a job that requires a productive PhD afterwards (if not, why are you doing one?)

Your PI is pointing you to ""buzzy"" topics because that'll get you published and accepted into conferences. It's possible of course that they're on a total ego-trip, but it's more likely they have a lot of experience in how their field works and they know when to jump on trends that align with their field. 

Regarding your own ideas, how much reading around have you done in the three months you've been there? How much longer do you think you'll need? I would suggest you start on your PIs idea, maybe with a quick paper that won't take a lot of time or thought, depending on how possible that is in your field. In the meantime you can do your extra reading, and find something that will work you without totally ignoring the work your PI wants you to do. Once you decide what you want to do, pitch a paper outline to your PI. Think about these timelines (PI pet paper done by when? Your pet paper outline done by when?) and discuss with your PI now whether that works for them. If they shoot you down completely, perhaps it's time to find somewhere else to study.

So, here is where the ""advanced"" from ""advanced trainee"" comes in. You need to take responsibility for your timelines and your productivity. You can't spend many more months simply reading, you gotta start doing (unless you're in a country that requires grad courses, in which case a lot of the early time will be taken up with those and reading is probably all you can fit in). Your PhD will likely change and morph while you're doing it. I'm *not* saying ""rush headlong into anything and everything"" but I am saying ""do a thing while you try and think of a better one"". PhD work happens in parallel, not in sequence.

There's a caveat with this though: PhDs are mentally and emotionally exhausting affairs. They are marathons of hard work and self-doubt, and they require resilience and self-care (in the eat well/sleep well/exercise sufficiently-kind of way). If your mental health is suffering significantly only three months in, you should consider either how to mitigate that or whether a PhD is for you.

(Note: I think it's appalling that PhDs are structured in a way that make some students' lives an absolute misery and I think change is necessary, and soon.

On the other hand I found my PhD quite easy and enjoyable. I thought it would be very difficult because I'd read all the scare stories on the internet, but it wasn't. I knew that my rent and bills were covered for three years by my scholarship, I was free to read and write about basically whatever I wanted, and my supervisor recognised that I was capable so at my request gave almost complete freedom to manage my own time. I honestly had a great time. I'd happily do it again. The only disappointing bit was running a couple of months over completing it within three years.",9,2018-11-19 19:45:57

I believe there are absolutely over-shares, but I think the field is currently unnecessarily stigmatizing and it's contrary to our own interests as a field. (E.g. ""I took time off due to health issues"" and ""I took time off due to mental health issues"" should be equally appropriate as an explanation for a gap on an application.)",3,2018-11-17 17:39:59

So when I cried in graduate school it was usually stress-related or over struggles with imposter syndrome. 

As others have mentioned, graduate school experiences vary quite a bit by discipline, department/program dynamics, and individual differences in stress management. 

It’s important that if you ever feel overwhelmed or find yourself constantly on the verge of tears, you access mental health services available in your campus. Graduate school has a way of exacerbating underlying anxiety disorders or creating new ones.

It seems like it ends up perversely suggesting that mental illness is incompatible with academic/professional success, which seems line a weird thing for a psychology program to be unusually bad at.

e9okm3s,t3_9wwxvr,True,natebam,t2_zlbx2,"Hey friend, I'm sorry you're feeling down. Grad school can be difficult. Here is my advice, as a current grad student.

1. Find something to get involved with outside of grad school commitments. I know, it sounds counterproductive because you're adding something else to your plate. But, it helps me a lot. I sing in a local chorus and we rehearse once a week and that makes my entire week better. Give yourself that outlet.

2. Make sure to stay socially connected with people outside of grad school. I am currently struggling with this because, as a natural introvert, I don't want to be around people after a long week of class and work. But it's going to be healthy for you to be around people you love and care about most. 

3. Seek mental health resources. Grad students are put under so much pressure. You are not weak for seeking help; no one is expecting you to be be strong all of the time. Remember to voice your needs to your advisor; in my opinion, they should be one of your main guides. 

4. Try to plan a fun little event or trip. Sometimes physically removing yourself from the environment temporarily can work wonders. I love to travel and I have found dirt-cheap flights and AirBnBs and it's refreshing for the soul to just be somewhere else for a while.

I hope this is somewhat helpful. Let me know if you need anything.",5,2018-11-14 14:47:59

My tips: (coming from a wet lab based background so amend as necessary)

1. Speak with your potential supervisor and ask him about culture of the lab

2. Speak with other students past and present (past students would give more honest feedback but may be hard to track down) 

3. If things are not working out with your supervisor speak with the university support and consider changing. It’s much easier to change early in your PhD than after 3 years. 

4. Don’t stress so much. Good scientists aren’t exactly good managers and bosses. So take what they say with a grain of salt. 
 (My supervisor told me the other day that I don’t have enough for a PhD, what he means is “I want to stress you out so that you work harder and faster and stay focused”)

5. Speak with other students, try make friends. Can be helpful to have people who have been through it and can give advice and wisdom. 

6. Seriously don’t stress, just chug along. Nothings end of the world stuff. Always will be more work to do. Can’t finish it all. Make time for yourself and mental health. ",2,2018-10-01 05:35:16

e6ug638,t3_9juojq,True,CytotoxicCD8,t2_16oifq,"This may be true for the American system but definitely not the case for the Australian system. 

In some aspects PhD is the easiest part of your career. The degree is only 3 years with a max of 4 years. Most people finish between 3.5-4 years. 

You are guaranteed pay for 3.5 years (4 years as a citizen/perm resident). So you are not part of the grant application game. Not expected to apply for funding. Poor labs may ask you to but this would mean you are in a very poor lab and i would argue you should leave. 

It is hard work but it’s not impossible. You can easily get by doing 9-5 solid work a day. Most likely will be working quite a few weekends. But it is very flexible and I haven’t felt that my social life or mental health has suffered. It is stressful though. It does become your life. It’s full time. So when not actively working you are thinking about work and guilty for not working. The typical description is that a PhD is a marathon not a sprint. It’s long and arduous but not impossible. I’d honestly do another one if it wasn’t for the low pay. 

In Australia you get approx $25,000 a year, tax free. Iv had no problems and live quite comfortably but I have no dependants and live with a partner doing her PhD. We live in one of the cheaper Australian cities. 

I would agree that your supervisor is very important and have heard a couple of horror stories. These are rare. I only know of one person who had to swap PhD labs half way through. But they are not likely to have to restart and will probably just continue in a new lab on a new project. Most people who have supervisor troubles will swap labs early on. Otherwise just tough it out and get it done. My supervisors mentality is “it’s just a PhD, just submit so you can get on with real work”.  In Australia, people don’t fail they either drop out or the take a bit longer than ideal. Assuming your supervisor isn’t a terrible person then you will submit a viable thesis and graduate. It’s also quite uncommon to be juggling multiple projects. Most people will have their main project and may have a second and collaborate with others (doing small experiments or analysis) but majority of work is on a single project. 

Science is hyper competitive but largely this is post PhD where you are fighting for grants and jobs. Sure it helps to have many papers in your PhD but this is largely lab based. I haven’t published but am not concerned about postdoc jobs because iv learnt many skills. My partner on the other hand comes from a lab where they publish requested and everyone works together. She has &gt;8 papers to her name. She’s more likely to get grants as an early career. But then it all comes down to what you plan after PhD. Just pick a lab accordingly.

You could look into the [Dementia Research Council](https://mrc.ukri.org/about/mrc-jobs/).

Things were pretty good for awhile tbh b/c I was excited about the work, but fast forward 6 years and I only have 1 review and a manuscript I've been trying to get published for almost 3 years. We are on our 6th journal after narrowly missing the cutoff (after revisions) by dissenting Reviewer #3 at Journal #4.

Understatements of the ages: Motherhood is hard. Postdocs positions are hard. Marriages are hard. All can be emotionally, mentally, and physically draining, sometimes all at once. You are in a unique situation in your lab where you are the only one who has to balance ALL of that. Just because someone junior than you can do something faster and allegedly better, it doesn't mean you are any less of a scientist. It just means that they have the luxury of more brain space and it's amazing how much more you can focus and accomplish when you aren't worrying about other things like the logistics of raising a child. You are not only sleep deprived, you have a unique set of responsibilities that NO ONE else in the lab can possibly understand at this point in their lives. 

Things I would tell myself 5 years ago: I wish that I had been more real with myself and more strategic earlier in my career. I spent too long ignoring my own mental and professional needs. I did not advocate for myself enough. Find mentors that understand your situation and can help you - friends, peers, other faculty - doesn't have to be your boss.

I left professional practice to start a career in academia, starting out as an adjunct, thinking I'd like to one day be tenured. 

A couple years in and a funded PhD opportunity opened up, and I decided to pursue that. I also learned that tenure track positions are rare, especially in certain fields, and when they do open up it's even more rare for a former student to get that opportunity. I wasn't going to get it just by being present, even if I was a good former student. 

From a school's perspective, they will think it's better to use that faculty line and bring in an established outside talent to round out their faculty, rather than bring on a former student who is already willing to teach for little pay. Staying on as an adjunct and just hoping to get the tenure track job may set you up for disappointment down the road. 

While it's not impossible, I'd recommend two things. 

First, have an honest conversation with someone you trust to give tough but solid advice (preferably a department chair or someone that makes hiring decisions). Talk about your teaching/career aspirations, and how likely what you're trying to do is. Take it as constructive criticism, but not gospel. I was told (in grad school) that I likely wouldn't get a tenure track teaching position without either a terminal degree (PhD in my case), or a stellar portfolio. It was good advice, and it changed my plans a bit. 

Second, don't set your sights on being an adjunct for too long. The pay stinks and the school is taking advantage of your talents to fill a budgetary gap. Take advantage of that time to connect with other departments or programs, and identify what might make someone with your experience more marketable. When I started I connected with public health, and now the rest of my career will be shaped by a hybrid approach which lends itself to cross-disciplinary research and collaboration. As an example, what would your art look like if it was in collaboration with early childhood development, or mental health, or sociology departments? Getting in as an adjunct opens up access to other events, forums, and departments. Taking advantage of that network as an adjunct can help you build up a career as an academic, and steer you towards the kinds of opportunities that hiring committees look for in tenure track faculty.

e5cqq1r,t3_9covvo,True,seekingzen1,t2_1yu4vywa,"Okay OP, you’ve been given some great advice here that mostly can be worked in after you have quieted your mind.  I’m an academic, PhD and bipolar.  I also am a bit older than a typical I went straight through from my undergrad to MA and then PhD.  Why?  I chose to get some life experience to work out what I wanted to do and then in my PhD, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had a 3 year pause before I finished.
So I’m going to start in a different place. And please don’t answer these questions here.
1.  Type of Bipolar 1 or 2.  If 1. Are you high functioning, medically compliant and able to function or are you struggling in any of these areas.  If you’re struggling in any of these areas, put education to the side.  Get treated, get functional, and maintain for a year before looking at school again.  Type 2, is it managed?
2.  An associates is a respectable degree!  Can you do what you would like with it?
3.  Is it your goal to finish undergrad or are you fulfilling a promise to your grandfather.  If you do this, you have to be in it for your own reasons...a degree has to be more important to you than it is to wanting to please someone else.  Your grandfather sounds amazing but is he accepting?
4.  What type of support system do you have?  Are you accepted and supported?  If not, I would start looking for that support from other people and communities.  There is a great bipolar community here.

OP, I think before you can find answers to these questions about school and work, you need to make mental health your first priority.  If it is great!  If it isn’t,  I can empathize bc making decisions when symptomatic is often impossible or unwise.  Can you talk to your grandfather?  Is he supportive?  And finally you have to establish a support system that you can rely on.  That knows you, supports you, guides you and keeps you compliant if needed.  I think if you address these things first, you will find there are interdisciplinary majors that would allow you to combine your interests.  Set some measurable goals and truly figure out is school is the best avenue at this time.  Once I stopped living by someone else’s definition of time, I made much more progress!

* Regular exercise. The absolute minimum for exercise is 5 days a week, 30 min per day cardio. Try the seated bikes at the gym and just bring a book. Lacking a gym subscription, get a [jump rope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYkJIOnT78). This  also helps your mind and mood.

* Meditation. Start with 10 min per day of [concentration meditation](https://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe5-6.html), and slowly work up to 20 min. This topic is kinda tricky and can take a while. It's best to find a teacher or a therapist in real life to guide you while still meditating. But lacking money/time, you can listen to [podcasts](http://audiodharma.org/), post on r/meditation, or worst case PM me for help.

Don’t get too hung up on the piece of paper (the degree). That said, do get an education—even if it’s work experience that leads you in a direction you want to go. Lots of times, a certification or license makes more difference than a degree.

And, not at all making light of your suffering, but sometimes people are depressed because their life just sucks. Look at what you can change. A slightly nicer living arrangement or location. Slightly more regular sleep/wake times. Slightly less alcohol/drugs. So on.  Some people claim CrossFit changed their lives, and for all I know, it might be true.

There are academic programs that really are all about gay and minority issues. If this dominates your life, then see if there are scholarships. You never know. They might really be looking for exactly what you offer.

On the other hand, there is another approach to life where you completely separate the money making part of your life from the soul-fulfilling part. The movie version of this is the corporate lawyer who spends his nights as a drag queen belting out torch songs. This is actually how MANY people survive.

There are also certain jobs that tend to be very gay friendly. What comes to mind is airplane cabin crew, but I’m not sure this is such a great job. Google and talk to people. You may not find an answer so much as a direction you should travel.

It's ok to change your plans.  I wanted a tenure-track position at a community college/2 year school. i applied to 100+ jobs. I couldn't seem to get past the interview stage, and I happened to apply to a four-year liberal arts school and got the job.

Best decision ever.  If I hadn't gone outside my focus, I never would've landed a wonderful tenure-track job with great colleagues and enthusiastic students.

I like the work-life balance working at a smaller school.  I only have to be on campus four days a week, and they really seem to care about things like maternity/paternity leave.  The pay is less, but the overall benefits to my mental health are worth it.

Another bit of advice is to not just listen to your PI.  They know the job they have - PI at research university.  My PI looked down on my desire to work at a community college, not realizing how they have changed over the last decade.  He said I had to do a post-doc to get on at a good university (maybe I wouldn't have had to apply to as many jobs, but I was able to start on the tenure track at 29, which is earlier than any of my friends in the US), but I knew I did not want to do a post-doc.

I don't mean to rant, but I wanted to explain that I know first hand how rough it can be financially and emotionally when this drags on longer than planned. 

If your husband is still at it after 5 years, it must be something he truly wants, so he should keep at it! PhD's are really tough in the sense that if you don't complete it and defend that finished end product, you'll have ""nothing"" to show for all your hard work and effort. One day you are nothing, and the next day after the viva you have a PhD and the world is your oyster.... this can stress the hell out of any human being. Your husband will just have to try to keep his eyes on the prize and hang in there until the end!

My partner's support was invaluable during this period, and I really truly could not have persevered without it. When your husband expresses guilt about your situation, remind him that you two are a team and that there will surely come a time when he will be carrying the heaviest work load. The best you can do is to continue to be there for him, support him, and try to make sure he isn't thinking about work when he shouldn't be!

If there are any opportunities to connect with other PhD students he should really do this, as talking to people who are in the same boat is very helpful. After all, they know exactly what it is like. It might also be helpful to make use of any mental health support available in order to try to get a perspective on things. I didn't do this, but I really, really, really should have. 

I don't know if changing supervisor or work environment is an option, but if it is, then that might be a good idea too. Not feeling like your supervisor has your back must be horrendous and such a strain.

Examples of this particular KOD in a personal statement included comments such as “showing evidence of untreated mental illness,” “emotional instability,” and seeking graduate training “to better understand one’s own problems or problems in one’s family.” More specifically, one respondent stated that a KOD may occur “when students highlight how they were drawn to graduate study because of significant personal problems or trauma.

If the choice was mine, I would never move out, get married, have kids, work a 9-5, and all those other adults things. If it was up to me, I'd just sit and play Fortnite all day. It isn't even necessarily because I'm lazy, either; the adult world just **does not interest me at all.** I seriously hate that I'm this way, because I look around me at all the other kids my age who are passionate about research and actually doing something with their lives, and **I just feel so lost and unmotivated.** It's like, the kinds of things that interest or concern me are things you might expect from a 12-year-old.

I wish so badly I was that way, because **I feel so utterly worthless as I am now.**


&gt; **Nothing excites or interests me** these days besides Fortnite. I used to (and still do, to some extent) enjoy writing, but even that is something I'm losing the willpower to do.

I believe the best way you can go about this is set a realistic list of goals fitting the requirements you know you will meet in your studies preparing for this career.   
So, the basic line of questioning would be:

\- what schools that offer programs suitable to this career are accessible to you? (Factoring in location, costs, GPA and other academic requirements)

\- where are you, from an academic standpoint, relative to those requirements? Do you have some covered, are there some that you still need to work towards? If the latter, are your targets reachable, reasonably speaking? (For example, do you have all the credits you need to graduate, does your GPA qualify you for these programs, is there something more you could do to boost your scores, in the time that you have left?)  
\- when it comes to what you perceive as weak points (gap years), focus less on explaining those, but do try to come up with a short sentence that you feel best expresses your reality, in case someone asks. (""Yes, there are some gap years during which I did various things, but I never stopped really wanting this for myself and I am in a point to pursue it now"", or something like that). Focus on what you have been doing in that time, especially since it seems you did do some cool things, including some related to the field you're interested in. Focus on that, talk about that the most. That proves you can already do the job, sort of, and with less education in the field than you would have after finishing your grad school. So grad school would only make you even better at that job.  


And most of all, focus on the fact that you do no owe anyone any explanation for your mental health. I don't think you even have to be specific about it. ""Personal health reasons"" may suffice. Looks like you can already show commitment to this path, so focus on getting them to see what a great candidate that makes you (""them"" being the admission committees of schools you have a realistic chance of entry into).

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Best,

OP

&amp;#x200B;

This is what I'd personally say to a professor. It sounds serious, sincere, and humble. You want your professor to know that *you know* that you're relying on their mercy, and that you're willing to do what it takes to pass their class. You do not want to sound like you expect to get 100s on late assignments. When you meet with him/her in person (which you should definitely do, it reinforces how serious you are, and it will demonstrate how dedicated you are), reinforce that you are ready to work with them to resolve this problem.

I had a problem in college, and when I went into my professor's office to talk to him (after sending an email with a similar tone as above), he told me he just wanted to make sure that I was okay, and that he'd waive my 2 absences. Professors are humans, too, and I'll bet you aren't the first student who has gone through this problem. Just make sure that your prof can see how genuine you are. Don't be surprised if he/she emails you later in the semester/pulls you aside to see how you're doing. Most of them do care!

I had a friend whose parent died during school, and I helped him write a similar email to his professors when he missed their finals to go to his mom's funeral. They can help, as long as you ask. If you never ask, they don't know.

I would also set up an appointment with the school's counselors. That way, when/if your professor asks about how you're doing/steps you've taken, you can share that with him/her. Plus, it'll help you!",4,2018-11-06 18:56:29
e96amlr,t3_9uo2kj,True,leighbs,t2_10bu54,"This is a fault of the university system, where student's need to often explain ( in either detail or briefly) their issues (whether they be mental, physical, family, etc) in order to avoid doing poorly in a class. Everyone here has given good suggestions on how to handle this and I agree that you should contact your Office of Accessibility/ email the professor to explain your issues. However, it angers me that you are required to do this and I'm sorry that this is your only avenue. I am currently a Ph.D student with aspirations to be a professor and it is one of my goals to eliminate this type of issue for my students. There is no reason you should have to explain your personal issues in an way in order to pass a class, but sadly, that is the current and only way of handling these issues. 

As an undergrad I missed a midterm due to a new medication I started taking for mental health issue that had horrible side effects. Embarrassed , I had to explain to the professor why I had missed the midterm, and he happily let me take a make up. I have not had that experience with all professors, for personal issue do not only strike once during college and can happen multiple times during a semester. There needs to be a better way for students to deal with life's many challenges while trying to earn a degree, besides having to explain personal and intimate issues of their lives. 

I just want to you to know, that I, and other Ph.D students and professors are working on changing this, so one day a student who experience issues similar to you ( or really any issues), won't need to worry about how explain to a professor or lecturer why they weren't able to complete an assignment and are afraid of failing.

The priority here needs to be your mental health. 

Is there a realistic scenario where you can get (maybe even pay?) someone to guide you through the program, get some useable data fairly quickly and produce 10,000 good-enough words WHILE keeping your mental and emotional wellbeing a priority? That last part is important, if you finish your thesis but are in such a bad place by the end of it that you aren't in a position to seek employment, then you will lose potential income, and have a big gap on your resume. That might be a problem. 

Alternatively, can you envision a future where you positively spin this in a professional setting - you did further study in nuclear-whatever but quickly realized academia wasnt the path for you, and having a good understanding of the Sunk Cost fallacy, you exited in a timely fashion with a diploma and a new appreciation for work-life balance? (I hire fairly regularly, and the above explanation sounds perfectly reasonable to me). Now, can you imagine feeling genuinely at peace with that story?

It’s theoretically possible to do research as a side gig.  I know a guy who works a government job 9-to-5 but spends the rest of his time studying and supposedly doing research on theoretical physics (“supposedly” because he has no training beyond undergrad physics and his work didn’t make a huge amount of sense to me when he explained it).  I’m not saying he’s the model to follow, but if he had done a postdoc in the field, he could be potentially quite productive based on the amount of time and effort he puts into it.  

Have you considered a career as a medical physicist?  They are quite well paid at hospitals and always in demand.  It would require some retraining (~2 yrs) but so would almost anything else.

What the other person mentioned is true, but I would actually argue that either of these three degrees can give you the knowledge and ability to do what you want to do. To be 110% straightforward with you, it’s actually all about **in what way** you want to want to help the population you want to work with.

Bear with me as I go on a tangent:

Mental Health Counselors will usually work with “patients” who’s received a diagnosis for some type of issue or illness and do 1:1 talk therapy to help them cope with what they have going on and how to beat most past that problem to create a better quality of life. Whatever that problem is that they have is believed to originate from within themselves.

Marriage and Family Therapists will often do the same thing, but they don’t see the nature of the problem from the person. Rather, they see the issue as something that stems from a relationship with another person (doesn’t have to be a spouse or family member). Then they help fix that problem with their “clients” by creating effective and efficient ways to better communicate how the person feels about everything (not as easy as it sounds).

Social Workers do kind of a cross between the first two, but they actually take things a step back by examining the environment that the person is in which may be the root cause of the problem they’re facing. They’ll work with their client or patient to fix the issue within the environment itself.

Their job is to provide immediate support and refer you to someone who can provide more long-term support. The university is a university, not a university/mental and behavioral health clinic. They don't have the funding, time, or manpower to support every student's every need. That's why they try to match students up with local counselors, therapists, and psychiatrists. Please understand that they are trying to help you as best as they can, but this may not have been communicated properly. It's also possible that you have seen a truly bad counselor, but that doesn't mean that every counselor is bad or that you're beyond help. It just means that they weren't a good fit. 

I highly recommend that you get in contact with your school's mental health services office, and see if they can help you find a counselor you feel comfortable with. If you're on your parents' medical insurance or are near your primary care provider, you might see if there are other offices within your network that are nearby and have openings. You don't necessarily have to tell your parents or doctor anything, and you could even frame it as you trying to be more responsible with your health by trying to take care of these things on your own. I don't know anything about your situation though, so none of that may apply to you. The point is, you have resources available to you, even though you might not be aware of some of them. 

Having a degree is incredibly useful, and it sounds like you have a good sense of the direction you want to go in life.

e84rqsz,t3_9pvdmm,True,Weaselpanties,t2_5w94f,"Hello future academic! 

I started college late in life as a broke, undereducated mixed-race single mom, so I am really feeling your predicament. I was pretty highly literate because both my parents have good educations, but my mom has serious mental health and substance abuse issues, which resulted in her withholding an education from me. Dad was out of the picture for most of my childhood, because Mom fled the state with me. So, while the story is a little more complex than this, basically I was an adult 3rd-grade dropout when I entered community college in 2012. I have learned A LOT about scholarships and financial aid since then and I am hoping some of what I learned will be helpful for you. 

First of all, yes, I do absolutely recommend applying to community college, if the one in your area has a good reputation. They vary widely. You have a great story and you're a strong writer, and my advice is; milk that. 

You'll want to start by filling out your FAFSA online so that you qualify for Federal financial aid. Make sure you check ""yes"" for work-study; it doesn't mean you'll get it but it won't hurt to apply. Depending on your state, this may include grants that will cover the majority (or all) of your community college tuition. You may also need to take out subsidized loans for the first couple of terms, but the next steps should help you minimize the amount of debt you graduate with, if any.

Next, apply to your community college. As soon as you're admitted, look for information on applying for scholarships through their website. Talk to advising if you don't see a link; most CCs have an application portal. Also look and ask around about a state-specific scholarship website; I don't know if all states have them but mine (Oregon) does, https://app.oregonstudentaid.gov/. Hopefully your state has something similar.

Apply for ALL scholarships you qualify for. When you do this, write your application essays in Word and save them in a folder so that you have a pool of pre-written essays that you can revise and build on for future applications. Keep an eye out for new scholarships becoming available, as the application windows are not all the same. You will probably win a small scholarship or two in the beginning; this is great, because when recipients of small scholarships do well, they become more likely to be awarded larger ones; you will note all of your scholarship awards on your CV. 

Next, look for internship programs for disadvantaged students. Many of these are for STEM, but not all. These are programs that hook up students who normally could not afford to gain experience in their field through unpaid volunteering with paid positions, often during the summer. Internship and volunteer experience is so important that even if you can't get a paid position, I highly recommend trying to fit in 10 hours a week of volunteer work in your field, if only during summers. Teaching music or acting to kids, whatever you can get involved in. 

Getting to know your professors by going to their office hours a couple of times a term will help them write you good letters of recommendation. 

Study groups are excellent for improving your grades, and also for making connections with people who you will likely keep running into throughout your career. Cultivate these contacts.

Like I said, 7 years ago I was a broke single mom. I'm not rolling in dough, but I just started my 2nd Masters program and am an adjunct professor at the community college where I started. It's humble, but it's a far cry away from the lifetime of retail work I was looking at a few years ago. 

Good luck, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions!

I have done this several times over the course of my career, mostly because of personal issues that were inhibiting my ability to be fully present at work and was causing me to underperform. I simply sat my PI down and said plainly ""I'm having a hard time with personal stuff and I'm not sure if you've noticed but I know that I'm not doing as well as I know I'm capable of. I just wanted to let you know that I'm working on getting better and that I'm still here, still committed to the project and that I just need a bit of time."" Any human being with a heart will empathize with this and respect you for coming forward and sharing your story, and for owning up to and recognizing that your productivity is suffering. 

I'm sure that your PI will have good advice, but if I were you, I'd make sure you were making your mental health a priority. Take breaks for meals and watch a 30-minute show without guilt. Drink lots of water. Get up and walk around the block to get some fresh air. Sleep enough. I have mental health struggles too, and this is what my therapist has always recommended to me. Nurture yourself and make sure you're making time for relaxation and decompression. As others have commented here, there are only so many hours in the day, and you should take at least one of those to yourself to help keep the stress level manageable. Better to ""sacrifice"" an hour of work so that the other hours in the day are as productive as possible (rather than spending all of your time working at half steam).

When I am overloaded with projects, I make sure that my ""to do"" lists are doable. Don't write down more than you can actually do in a day. Don't multi-task too much and try to work on multiple mentally draining projects in one day (ie. multiple med school applications). When you sit down to do a task, devote at least an hour or two to that task. You're more likely to get a lot more done in these little work sessions than if you tried hacking away at bits of multiple things at once.

e7ppg4u,t1_e7pjwdk,True,NoFlyingMonkeys,t2_1hgh9anj,"Yes, this holds true in medical schools. Specific cases are only  discussed if a trainee has died, but hard to keep the name private due to grapevine. We have reporting systems for trainees to get help for themselves, and for professors observing them, but it's not enough mainly because students try very hard to hide it.

80 hours a week, averaged over 4 weeks, is the current duty hour limits per the ACGME. (When I trained before that, most of us worked a lot longer). However, it is of course still very stressful also due to new patient care responsibilities. I can't say all professors are non-abusive, but it's certainly better than it used to be.

Before these hour limits, when I was a med student, 3 in my class attempted suicide (one succeeded). When I was a resident, 2 in our program were hospitalized for mental health, although not sure if suicidal. The postdoc I mentioned above was a medical fellow as well as a lab postdoc. Profs said nothing but we all knew because fellow students in the know did not respect their privacy. 

In my anecdotal experience, things seem much better now. I'm not aware of suicide attempts or mental health hospitalizations among our school's medical residents and fellows in the decades since I have been teaching (or, perhaps we're just better at privacy...). 

In terms of med students, the only case I was personally aware of, was my observation of severe mental health issues of one student that rendered her/him unfit to be a safely practicing physician - of course protection of the public from performance problems in our future physicians is an additional responsibility we have as medical faculty. 

I felt had to discuss it with the Dean's office - they were already aware, and said their hands were tied legally. Unfortunately when eventually forced to take time off for intensive treatment, the student committed suicide.",2,2018-10-13 21:31:44

Do you by chance happen to know, is it the same true for medical students? In medical schools, are suicide attempts also protected by FERPA, allowing the school to hide this information? I'm asking because there is quite a ""slow uproar"" in the medical education field, about high levels of stress among medical trainees, and so high suicide rates. It feels that FERPA can be conveniently used here to sweep these cases under the rug, and continue to descriminate against people based on their mental health. Also, as you right noticed, it further stigmatizes mental health issues; they become this unspeakable thing that you cannot even talk about. Oh well.",2,2018-10-13 20:04:28

FERPA mentions that health issues are to be disclosed to ""appropriate officials"", and fellow students are not appropriate officials. https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html

For OP, it is simply a moral issue and a common courtesy. Suicide attempts carry a very negative social and professional stigma in the US.

I'm not the only one who thinks this is covered by FERPA:  There was a fellow postdoc in the uni lab where I was training who suddenly ""went on leave"". I shared a lab bench with this person and I knew there were mental health issues.

You voluntarily gave your time to answer her questions, but this was done with no strings attached; she is not forced to continue working with you and you shouldn't be angry about it. She is free to change subjects, with the respective cost of doing so (writing new proposal, starting over, working with someone not so helpful, etc). Plans are constantly shifting and people should adapt to it.

From a practical standpoint,  don't try to pressure her, as then she might do a half-assed job at your project, and it could be even worse, as you will have to be over her ass for things to get done. Similarly, don't be hostile towards her (telling her that ""she should just work on another project""), building a hostile environment in a lab is a terrible thing to do, and will make a disservice to your own mental health. Have a sincere and friendly conversation on what she would like to do, and from then onwards decide a polite course of action.

In academia we are constantly doing things that are ""rewardless"", we review papers anonymously , we take PhD students that might fail for random reasons (or go to industry, gasp!), we help colleagues with their questions, we answer anonymous questions in reddit, etc. At the end, you have to decide what are you willing to do, and accept the losses of doing so.

Take this as a lesson, next time try to waste less time with your students, for instance teach them find answers by themselves or limit the questioning time (hey, I have just 30 minutes, what would you like to ask?).

I'm currently working at a pharmaceutical company in vaccine safety, but public health practice or epidemiological research are pretty common career choices after that academic path.

In terms of the pre-requisites: your background in the humanities shouldn't be a big drawback. Since epi covers a huge variety of topics and many of them are interdisciplinary, the required coursework component for my degree was way way more involved than for most other doctoral programs. It was really annoying at first, but I'm glad I was made to take all of the courses as part of my program because a) I needed the background and couldn't have gotten it any other way, and b) it's good to have exposure to all areas of the field so that even if you don't work in them, you know they're available if needed. Everyone in my year had very diverse academic backgrounds. For context, I have an undergrad in psychology and a masters of math in computer science. 

In terms of your health: the nice thing about epi is that people in the field tend to be very accommodating about health issues and barriers to access, because that's our whole jam. I think it would be very tractable to do a career in the field (either hands on, or more research-based) with impaired vision. You wouldn't be expected to do physical experiments as with biology or chemistry, and there are a lot of tools to accommodate vision impairments when working with computers. I don't have impaired vision so I can't comment on that specifically, but I had to drop half of my courses in the first term of my degree because of mental health issues. The administration was very willing to work with me to accommodate my illness so I could graduate on time.

I think it really depends how high your interest in research is... personally, I think you should really be very, very sure that the area you want to continue research in is something that you find super cool and something that you are naturally intrigued by. Whilst the initial proposal for a PhD project will probably be determined mostly by a supervisor, you have the opportunity to carve out what you want to discover and what you want to research -- I imagine this will be less true if applying for jobs in a similar area.

I graduated from a physics MSci from Imperial in 2017 and also suffered from mental health issues throughout (I had to take a year out), but I have to say that whilst PhD is stressful (I stayed at Imperial), there is a much stronger support group of supervisors, postdocs, fellow PhD students who all know what it is like and who are all really supportive. Personally, I've found the relaxed nature of a PhD (being able to work which hours I want to, being able to take a day off if I'm feeling particularly down, being able to work all day if i'm feeling manic!) has been relatively beneficial for my mental health.

Obviously, sometimes I think about how much I could be earning doing banking or being a consultant or something in the City, but at the end of the day I really love my PhD project and I'm really invested in it. I earn enough to live comfortably so for me, it's not that big of a deal.

There's no contradiction here: ""being yourself"" does not mean that you have to tell the interviewers about what you ate for breakfast, or what type of underwear you prefer, or whether you loved your father as a kid, or whether you have a strong opinion about country music. There are so many things that you don't have to reveal, even though they are technically part of ""yourself"" as well. Some because they aren't important, some because it's not their darn business, some because they are not relevant, or because it is not easy to discuss them. It's perfectly fine.

Mental illness is one of the things that are not relevant, not their darn business, and also is not easy to discuss. If you want to comment on your bad grades in school or whatever, just say that you had some hard times, but that you found a way to overcome them later. Don't be too cryptic, so that they wouldn't have to fantasize about that, but don't be too explicit as well. If they ask ""what was so hard?"", say ""lots of things"". Hopefully they will get a clue. If they don't, say, ""I don't like talking about that, as I had some health issues and family problems"". This will make them shut up all right. And it won't be a lie, technically, which makes it easier.

And good luck! You'll be fine! Don't worry about it, and don't feel like you're not being honest enough or whatever; you are fine!

What is the nature of the scholarship? On what basis are they awarded? What are their criteria?

I do, unfortunately, think that the biggest risk you'd take is related to the stigma, which sucks, and which is also the reality we're working with. I also think this could work against you in two ways--first off, if there is even a HINT of irregularity in your academic history, I could see your disclosure encouraging some people to look at that more closely as evidence that your schizophrenia makes you an academic risk. Secondly, to SOME readers, this might sound like over-pandering or an appeal to their sense of pity--as in, you should win because you've had things much tougher than others. Is this a common theme for applications? You bet. Might this be differently (and even unfairly) interpreted when in the context of a mental health issue? I'm afraid it might be. 

I've found that many people in academia are not, in fact, as open minded and forward thinking as they'd like think they are when it comes to mental health.

And as you say, these are usually junior career researchers. They may have barely got through their PhD, possibly in a slightly different area, and been offered a postdoc position due to appearing strong during interview, but then it might have turned out they weren't that good or motivated in that area of research (or indeed research in general).

In other fields, people might be more satisfied with only a bachelors or masters because there are potentially more jobs available to them. 

Anyway, I *was* a little miffed at the fact I majored in something with very low chance of me getting a TT position. You’re right about that. The point of my post was that no one I knew understood how difficult the process of getting into a program and then getting a job is. Everyone I knew in high school and my entire family figured I’d get a great paying job and get into the programs of my dreams because I was a great student. Of course, the highest degree anyone in my family got was an associates from a business trade school, so I went into college with big dreams and little knowledge of the field. My professors did warn me (certain ones anyway), but it came a little too late. So I switched focus to becoming a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner.

Usually the requirements will include (at a minimum) intro, research methods, psych stats, history and systems, and ~9 hours of psych electives. Taking these courses will greatly improve your chance of admission compared to applying without a psych degree.

However, as many have pointed out, Clinical Psych is the hardest program to get into by far. Take some time to tour a mental health facility, volunteer at a clinic, and really see if Clinical is for you. You may find out you're REALLY actually interested in Counseling Psychology. 

Clinical Psychology deals more with extreme cases like schizophrenia, oppositional defiant disorder, severe OCD, and body dysmorphia - psychological disorders that are chronic and severe. Counseling deals with more mainstream personal and interpersonal issues, conflicts, and problems. I say this because people often confuse the two and are really surprised with severity of cases they'll encounter as a Clinical Psychologist.",1,2018-07-11 11:21:50

e1sib1c,t1_e1sf87s,True,revthwy,t2_c553dju,"Staff do a lot of important work at the university - no one is saying we should get rid of the janitors or the cafeteria workers or the bus drivers or the IT department or the admissions and financial aid officers. In fact, many of those folks on the bottom rung of providing services to the university deserve to get paid more. However, there are several big problems with the growth of administration. 

The first is that not all of these new jobs are actually useful to anyone else at the university - they just push paper around, creating more work for everyone just so they can look busy. Some even admit this. [The growth of mid-level management that does nothing but ""supervise"" people who don't need supervising, thus necessitating a team of useless admin assistants to these useless managers,](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Are-You-in-a-BS-Job-In/243318) is pretty absurd. According to the [New England Center for Investigative Reporting](https://www.necir.org/2014/02/06/new-analysis-shows-problematic-boom-in-higher-ed-administrators/), ""The number of non-academic administrative and professional employees at U.S. colleges and universities has more than doubled in the last 25 years, vastly outpacing the growth in the number of students or faculty."" Think about the amount of resources spent on ""strategic visioning"" or plans to reorganize the internal operations of the university even though things were working fine before or circular fundraising efforts that raise money to pay the salaries of the people who call up alumni to ask for money. I mean, how many useless committees have you been forced to sit on? Maybe at a small school like yours it isn't as much of an issue, but at big state schools there are endless vacuous committees that all the faculty members dred sitting on because they are pointless. Much of this could simply be cut, tomorrow, without anyone missing these positions.

The second problem is that the university is currently expected to take on the responsibilities of the government and fill the gaps in a thinning social fabric writ large. How many resources are expended to provide students with basic healthcare, [counseling](https://www.agb.org/trusteeship/2017/mayjune/under-pressure-the-growing-demand-for-student-mental-health-services), nutrition and fitness? How many resources are spent ensuring that students have opportunities to socialize and connect with one another? How many resources are spent providing help to students facing interpersonal conflicts, difficulty with adult responsibilities, legal problems, social isolation, stress, health problems, discrimination, or violence? This is a complex problem; the university can't cut most of this, or the students will suffer, but it isn't fair that we are being expected to finance basic resources that government or society should be providing, but isn't. And at the same time, state funding is being cut!

Finally, [many of the jobs now being handled by administrators used to be handled by faculty](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-fall-of-the-faculty-9780199782444?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;), but because of increasing pressures to publish publish publish almost exclusively, professors don't have nearly as much time to do things like sit in on their advisee's courses and provide feedback on teaching. Hence, we need a Teaching &amp; Learning Center! Likewise, faculty are too busy to keep track of graduate students' progress or university-wide deadlines, so now we need extra staff at the graduate school and the enrollment office and the dean's office and each department - at least some of which is devoted to pushing students out as quickly as possible with no regard for the pace that is appropriate for the particular kind of research. Many of these rules are new inventions in the last 20 years, and they change constantly. What if we went back to a model where your committee (and to some extent, the department) had the latitude to give you strict deadlines and requirements or allow flexibility, as appropriate for a given situation? Do we need all these people supervising whether some PhD student must go up for exams right now, or must take this course, or whatever?

Personally, I found the Oxbridge academic culture really awful - very high pressure, and keep-up-or-get-out rather than supportive. From what I hear, it's better at research level, but the undergraduate teaching was pretty dire and obviously last priority for fellows.

I've also worked/studied at 3 other institutions, ranging from other Russell group to ex-poly to excellent labs at overall mediocre universities abroad, and honestly Oxbridge had a culture unlike any other I've been at. It wasn't healthy - of my group of friends, *every single one* has admitted to having mental health difficulties whilst there due to the culture, and yet not one could admit it even to their friends whilst there as the stigma against not keeping up is so high.

It's normal to mourn relationship changes. At the end of the day, your supervisor is your boss and the person who is setting the tone of the relationship.

I was mature enough to have a *professional* relationship with them (and a pretty good one) without wanting to be their buddies. As you should in a workplace. That they *were* buddies did not make me want to cry for justice and force them not to go out for drinks if they won't invite me. Because frankly it's childish.


Academia is not a good place for work-life balance; this is why I left it. It's nothing new. The current attempts by self-proclaimed social justice warriors to right every wrong is simply stupid at the highest levels. It's a high stress, high workload environment, and definitely not an office with a 9/5 schedule, so you really should not apply the same standards there as in a stupid multinational pencil pusher job.

Oh my... did not think mentoring on the scientific method was in the forefront of bar-conversations...), then perhaps she really is not cut out to be weathering out the brutal trials and tribulations of academia. Because guess what. It's a really freaking brutal world to *everyone*. If not getting a drink with people who don't even seem to like you makes you break down crying you will have serious issues even in a cushy, well paying job, let alone in academia.


&gt;Many good scientists are being forced to leave the academia.

Because they are not invited out to drink with the others. Personally I left because I realized I won't be able to hold down a relationship long enough to propose, marry and have kids, but maybe the drinks had a role in it, too.

&gt;We need balance, ethics and respect in the workplace. 

Yes. We do. And you are standing on the soapbox demanding respect in a workplace in a thread discussing things *outside* of the workplace. You see the irony here? There is so much abuse in academia it's not even funny and here you are baying to forbid adults to go out and have some time for themselves as they wish.


&gt;We should also stop thinking that academics are allowed to be jerks, racists, sexists.


Sure thing. Which OP's colleagues are not based on what she wrote, so it's absolutely a non-sensical statement in this context. They just not inviting her to their drinks for whatever reason. But you, and the rest decided that the only reason can be her vagina  (without ifs or whats). It may equally be because 

1. she is new to the group, and not been accepted yet
2. her personality does not fit with theirs (they don't like her)
3. they do not wish to get in trouble for precisely the same crowd demanding them to stop going out for hanging out with a female outside of work
4. they do wish to have a men-only time for themselves where they can relax
5. or any other reasons -all of them being a valid one.

She can either accept it, or do another adult thing, and *ask them* (I know it's a revolutionary thought), or move to a different lab if it is so taxing her mental health is in danger.


EDIT: it's really amusing to see how OP complains about not getting the same treatment in lab (suck it up), but kind of expects the princess treatment with her problem of not getting accepted socially into the lab.

Having finished my phd only a year ago, I've unfortunately seen a few advisors steering their grad students in the opposite direction. For example: 

I led a first-year ""welcome to grad school; here's some tips to succeed""-style seminar during the last year of my program. As a tip, I suggested finding or keeping a hobby that students enjoy and sticking to a plan to indulge and enjoy time spent with this hobby a few hours each week to maintain sanity. I even made the caveat that there will be weeks where this may not be possible, but did say that work-life balance is difficult in a time-demanding job, so grad school is a good time to learn skills towards achieving whatever a healthy balance means for each person.

An advisor had been sitting in on that session and contradicted me in front of the first year students, saying that work-life balance is over rated and grad school is the only time in our lives that we will be able to devote ourselves to our studies fully. She said the answer to mental health isn't to ""just go bake a cake"", but to instead be better at our own research.

From the faculty side, my colleagues and I would likely not be ""annoyed"" at a long incomplete, but it would raise serious concerns about the learning objectives associated with the assignment.

dztqqz0,t1_dztahdp,True,hhd411wild,t2_aic58,"I agreed w/ u/Jake_JAM about deciding which direction you see yourself take after completing your degree. I was on track to continue with my PhD; but decided to settle with a masters for two reasons. One, I didn’t like the environment where I studied. This institution provides the latest instrumentations for me to do research and I received hands on training from the field engineers on operating the instruments. The school provides technical trainings for me to learn as a researcher which I mastered during my masters program. Two, I didn’t enjoy working with individuals at this program. It had too much of academia politics that was very toxic for my mental health. Originally, I wanted to work in the pharmaceutical field and eventually lead the lab as I progress through my career. PhDs in chemistry and pharmaceutical sciences make about 60k plus after they finish their degrees. Some other fields such as the food industry (which I switched over) makes the same and often more with a masters. After working in the mid size generic pharma, I realized I had to start from the bottom as Chemist I with a masters or a PhD for a shitty low salary. This is very typical for those who work in pharma. Industry cares more about industry experiences than academia works. I had mentors who told me that low salaries for entry level positions for masters and PhDs in pharma had to do with the lack of experiences in QC and gov regulatory compliances. Currently, the trend in the science industry (pharmaceutical and food industries) focuses on both technical and business experiences. This is where having both MS and MBA is highly desirable than having a Ph.D solely. The core of pursuing a PhD should always be about science and not profits. I know a few PhD students who are on track to graduate within the next two years expect six figures salary when they accept their first job in the industry. This view is wrong and you shouldn’t based on this desire to get a PhD. 

Last comment: student loans was another reasons why I left academia and started working. I don’t want to be paying my student loans in my late 40s. I want to start my own business and pay off these debts as quickly as possible. ",2,2018-05-30 15:19:06

Also, on letters of rec in general, I'm currently a rising senior but am only now getting my mental health problems together, so I'm afraid there aren't too many people I'd feel super comfortable asking for a rec.

It wasn't until I realized the somewhat shitty culture, extremely poor work\-life balance, and difficulty of actually landing a tenure track job that I considered other careers. It was a big crisis for me.

I've been told a few things that have helped me. One is that academia is for depth, not breadth. You are interested in many things. I am too! Therefore, the potential for specializing in one particular niche is  possibly very boring. Another issue, like you said, is the arrogance of a lot of professors. This varies by field, school, and department, but yes, I do think that having a PhD is likely to go to \*anyone's\* head. Being grounded/realistic/not snooty is important for me and that culture seems very toxic. Again, some people have great luck and end up in caring and intellectually stimulating environments. But a lot of others end up with abusive bosses and crazy schedules.

What I am considering now is becoming a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner \(it would take me about 5\-6 years since I have a BA in cognitive science\), while continuing to do some science communication on the side. I'm basically working on an artistic explanation of schizophrenia right now, where I time\-lapse a painting and voice over it. Ideally, doing the latter as a career would be a dream, but it's relatively unrealistic. The problem solving aspect of therapy \+ meds interests me a lot.

If you're struggling to cope with undergrad, a PhD will not be easier. It will only be harder and more taxing. I would suggest taking some time, get some work experience but most importantly get some therapy, work on your issues and get yourself to a healthy place before embarking on the PhD.

Grad school can take down those who are 100% neurotypical and who have no difficulties in their personal lives, and it doesn't sound like you're in the right headspace at the moment.

Whether or not academia is the right path for you is a pretty personal decision. Are there people with poor social skills and mental health struggles in academia? Certainly. Are there people with similar challenges who cannot handle academia? Certainly. The category you fall into is far too personal for any here to really know.

So I suppose, could you ""do something"" in academia? I really don't know, and I'm not sure anyone else here will be able to say either. Do you feel you could handle the stress and pressure of a PhD? Are you capable of conducting independent research? Do your career goals necessitate a PhD? Or is there another route that you're more confident in that you could take? 

That being said, I recognise that therapy is out of the question but it certainly sounds like you would benefit from it. The issues you list with your social skills sound more like you over-thinking situations than actual social faux-pas. If you've exhausted your university's therapy options, and you cannot pay out of pocket/via insurance for any more, I'd suggest looking into free resources in your area.

Asking for anything you can do between now and then is really not much in the way of demonstrating that you know the material. Plus the professor is likely swamped at the moment. Perhaps consider if it would be possible for you to take an incomplete in the course for now and then the professor can come up with appropriate make-up work for you to complete.

Professor's are people too and they understand that there are legitimate reasons why student's struggle and are often willing to work with you if you show you are willing to work with them. The problem is that professor's also get a ton of bullshit excuses and entitled students who ask for grade bumps at the last minute and you want to steer well clear. 

Explain your situation: That you had a lot of issues early in the semester with your family and mental health, but you've since taken personal responsibility and made positive steps towards improvement (and your late semester performance reflects that).

Just wanted to reassure you that you're not sunk yet, second year is still early days and quite frankly I didn't get seriously involved in research until around that point as well! The easiest way to get a leg in with professors is to 1) show interest in the class material, make sure you're getting help with the difficult concepts that are bringing your grades down and 2) get a feel for their area of research and see if that might be a good fit for you. The first step is to get some volunteering done with a lab - that'll set you up for your Bachelor's thesis, and maybe get you a supervisor for your M.A. if you decide to go that route.
As you commented earlier, yes you do have to first complete a Masters degree before pursuing a PhD in Canada (although I'm not sure if this is the case in Quebec, if that's where you are).
For extracurriculars, why not volunteer with a mental health clinic? Many universities offer support to their students, and often these clinics are understaffed, why not just visit and have a chat with the people that work there, see if they need some extra help?

I’ve had some students in crisis say that my words or actions have helped them. And I’ve lost one student to suicide. So yeah, I think talking about mental health is important, and it’s also important to get to know your students and be aware when they’re acting out of character or are in a crisis.

If your school offers crisis / suicide prevention / mental health first aid training, I’d highly recommend it. I’ve been to a few, and at some I’ve learned a lot, and at others I’ve simply learned that I already have good instincts, and that itself is valuable information too. ",3,2018-08-30 04:28:15

Unfortunately, now isn't the time to be making these decisions because you don't know what your options are - if the committee is meeting to see what it is they want to do, you have to wait until they *tell* you what you can choose to do. As you point out, they may make the decision for you. In the meantime, I would talk to your major advisor (assuming you're not in some field where you're doing rounds or enter as a cohort and pick later) and, more importantly, go talk to a mental health professional(s) that addresses *all* of your problems, because you're clearly ignoring some things. If you're allowed to continue, consider looking into a semester leave of absence to *take a break* from things and get reoriented.

Finally, I'm going to point something out that I thought would have been mentioned to you or at least made obvious by the fact that your professors continue to award you As and Bs: your classes in your PhD *don't fucking matter*. No one cares. As long as you're above the threshold to have the credits count, no one gives a shit. Hell, the professors barely care about teaching those classes. The things that matter in grad school are your comps, your grants, your pubs, and your defense (which also doesn't really matter except to make it official, it should be a formality by that point).

My opinion on this is that you would benefit from taking your own mental health more seriously. It is unique to you and you need unique support with it. 

If someone has agoraphobia and panics each time they leave the house do you think it makes any difference that other people can leave the house without issue? Why would comparing them to other people mean anything? Would you tell this person ""you should be able to leave the house and telling us you can't is a great disrespect to everyone who doesn't struggle with this?""

IMO during a PhD your number 1 job is looking after your own mental health. Psychological problems were, by far, the biggest problem I had in my PhD and that my friends had while doing theirs. They are always a widely reported problem.

There is no shame in taking time off and going at a slower pace. You are a high achiever and so it can feel like if you are anything other than perfect everyone will come down hard on you.

Luckily, my advisor is also great. It took me having a total breakdown to see it.

It took a semester for me to get past more guilt and to realize that I need time to figure out if the PhD is right for me and, ultimately figure out what I want to do for the rest of my life.

Long story short, you won't get more done, and you'll suffer for it anyway. There are times when working 18 hours a day are inevitable, like some kinds of field work and the occasional hard push in the lab (I ran an assay that took 39 hours once... in a row, with 5 people coming and going to help me) but I'm talking about your day-in-day-out routine. Keep those hours in check, take weekends off, and take a week off twice a year, to keep burnout at bay.  


I also want to add that when you love your work AND you give yourself plenty of space around it, you end up thinking, reading, and talking about your work a great deal in your free time. Free time is when my best brainstorming happens. So you'll be a better and more creative researcher if you have unstructured time, with plenty of space for thinking and reading.

New people need a realistic overview of what grad school is like, but also a rational perspective of how they should have a work life balance.

e3grl71,t1_e3g6ync,True,PurrPrinThom,t2_6t2ba,"There's the opportunity cost associated with academia: pursuing higher education pushes the start date of you entering the workforce back by a few years. That means that while your friends might be buying houses, starting families etc. you'll still be in school, and likely not making much money. If you've taken out student loans for your education at any stage, you'll have to push back paying them off, while your friends will have already begun to chip away at them. 

Working a lot without much pay is pretty accurate, as while many PhDs are funded, they don't exactly pay *well*. It's usually just enough to live - and frequently below minimum wage. Many programs also prohibit students from working outside of their PhD, so students are often forced to scrape by. It's also very difficult to balance what are, essentially two full-time jobs, meaning that those who *do* work outside their degree often delay finishing by a few years. Post-docs vary wildly in funding, but many do not pay particularly well either, so even after you've gotten the degree and are working, it's not as if you're starting in a well-paying job. I've seen post-docs that also pay just barely above minimum wage. 

As touched upon by u/exsuit, mental health struggles are common in academia because it feels like a race you can't possibly win. In order to get a job you need to have ample publications and teaching experience, but these things are often time-consuming and detract from your actual degree, so many of us are overworked and burnt out. There's also ""imposter syndrome,"" which is feeling like you've faked your way to where you are and you're not nearly good enough. 

Because there are so few jobs available, pursuing a career in academia - especially in the early stages - often means opening your job search to the entire world in hopes of finding something. I don't know anyone in the early stages of their research career who *hasn't* made multiple, international moves - essentially job-chasing. For many people this entails leaving a partner (and possibly children) behind, or delays having children, pets, buying a home, also means you have to leave family and friends etc. And to be clear, this isn't necessarily moving for the *best* job or a *dream* job, it's usually moving for the *only* job.

Admin definitely seems like the way to go based on how I operate (the conscientious/somewhat neurotic type). I have applied to NGO's, health care firms, etc., but it is indeed time to go back through the organizations I've already applied to with a fresh cover letter and CV.

I think you're right that I've been limiting my options to more ""reach"" organizations (Harvard, BU, Tufts, Suffolk, Brandeis...), but--following your advice to do something desirable--I am definitely, 100% more motivated to work within an academic institution conferring degrees and organizing cohorts/events/speakers/scholarships than, well, somewhat more drab options. I mentioned both MBA and JD programs, and while actually registering for the GMAT/LSAT and preparing motivation statements for those programs is a long, long way off, I would be very interested in working in those programs from within on the admin side of things.

The graduate degree: earliest entry is likely 2019, which I may well go for, but considering my interests in terms of which degree to ultimately pursue are wildly varied, I would be more content with securing employment and possibly looking into night classes to bolster the skills where I am most lacking (quant, specifically) and help settle requirements for grad programs of interest while re-establishing credibility.

&gt;The ideology of the republican party seems to essentially be that if it requires public spending and it isn't the military then it is eventually surplus to requirements. They don't really care if you're creating jobs if you're creating jobs by using public funds.

That seems to be at least partly true wrt the GOP. Two additional considerations would be that 1. I don’t consider President Trump to be a Republican in the classic mold of the GOP, and that’s great 2. I’d prefer that my job existed in the private sector sans government funding, but that’s a tough sell for prevention research because it’s so difficult to monetize results. I do bring in a lot of donor money and some pharmacy funds for software development, so although I can’t really practice science in an Atlas Shrugged sort of way, I do try to be diverse in my funding streams. 

&gt;If this administration thought that a private entity could achieve the things your doing with public money wouldn't you just be cut loose?

Yes, and I should be. But then I’d go work for that private entity. 

&gt;Also if they are really concerned about health improvement why are they trying to roll back any progress towards a universal healthcare system that is clearly effective in many other countries? It seems only health improvement for the select few is important. The US has, I think, the highest healthcare spending in the world but doesn't provide adequate healthcare to significant portions of the population, something doesn't add up there?

This is pretty loaded so I’ll just say that the US spends the most on healthcare but also (hear me out here) has unequivocally the best medical treatments in the world. The disparity in results across countries, where the US does indeed lag behind, is primarily due to deficiencies in healthcare delivery and in prevention efforts. If Spaniards ate the same diet that Americans did and got similar amounts of physical activity, Spain would almost certainly have worse health outcomes than America currently has. Our medical system has weaknesses - especially in delivery, but by in large, it is superb. Health promotion and a culture of healthful living is, however, a complete train wreck in the US. 

&gt;I'm always confused as to what the phrase make America great again actually means, what time period is it actually referring to? A lot of American history is pretty grim reading...

It’s a slogan, it’s catchy, and I wouldn’t suggest investing too much mental energy in it. However, a little mental energy is probably okay and I think it mostly refers to American trajectory. 2015 was the first period in modern polling history in which a majority of Americans felt that the next ten years would be worse, not better than, the previous ten years. So MAGA seems more to be about making America ascendant than “great again” relative to some non-arbitrary timepoint. 

And yes, history is pretty grim but I am not willing to concede that American history is any more grim than the history of other period-matched nation-states. Japanese-American internment during WWII was awful, but at the same time in history there was a systematic attempt in Europe to exterminate a race of people and, simulataneously, Japan was raiding the shores of China and Korea to capture sex slaves for their military personnel. Slavery was horrific, but it was horrific throughout the world throughout history, and America fought a war largely for the purpose of bringing the practice to an end. The Kent State shooting was horrible, but it was part of a larger context in Vietnam that eventually led to America winning the Cold War, stabilizing nuclear relations, and halting the spread of communism. So to me, American history is fantastic and inspirational, despite having many blemishes that should best be utilized to educate us in our pursuit of future betterment.",2,2018-07-25 18:52:11

you are currently an RA in a lab NOT working toward a degree with that lab

you have been accepted to a different master's program that is in...business? Something not in a lab.

you have been working in this lab since August and will continue to work there until your other job starts, and this is the first time that some evenings and weekends might be required.

 Is that right?

&amp;#x200B;

Setting boundaries and pushing back against being assigned duties that you can't handle (needing to stay sane makes it ""can't"" not ""won't"", imo) is a healthy action. Now, your PI may feel let down, but you seem to be switching fields anyway, so she can deal with some disappointment. And probably should, it's good that someone pushes back. I do think that it strikes me as odd that you are so committed to your 40 hour week. Sometimes I have slow weeks where I probably don't work 40, other weeks when deadlines are pressing, I work much more. I have a work-life balance, I take time off for vacation or mental health days, but I also know that sometimes I'm going to need to be 24/7 on a project. I think being committed to your work-life balance doesn't have to mean being committed to 9-5 and not a moment more. The project you're managing and the people on that team may view you as not a team player or a crappy leader if you have to go home at what seems like an arbitrary time to grad students. I think my PI encourages us to have a work-life balance, but I think the nature of our lab work is that sometimes you have to work 12 hour days. And the nature of writing, I have found, is coordinating edits at 1130 pm for a midnight submission. I would have tried to avoid a 24/7 push push push lab group if I were you, but welp, that ship sailed.

I don't understand why you think that your situation has changed so drastically, it's not clear from your post. I also don't know what kind of job you're ever going to work that doesn't SOMETIMES require overtime. Do those exist? Maybe. I don't think they exist in academia, which I feel like you should have had some concept of coming into being an RA in the type of lab you chose. I'm kinda hung up on the fact that you've been in this lab for half a year and haven't had problems and yet you're now worried that you will be a slave to the job. Maybe you're already doing fine setting your behavior? Who expressed these weekend and night obligations, and did they give you a sense of like how often or how long those demands will persist? How did you respond when those expectations were laid out?

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, moving on from my massive confusion.

One great way to keep your work separate is to stop answering emails on non-urgent matters on evenings and weekends. I think I kinda get a rush from the rapid reply, but they say it makes us all a lot more stressed. It also low-key sets the expectation that you guard your free time and is a good example to set.

I believe that the advisor-advisee relationship is one of the most important parts of the phd process, and if it goes south it will be really tough to get through. My soured realtionship resulted in the dredging up of old mental health problems.

ee9zs5g,t3_agycuo,True,middledeck,t2_6pauh,"There is substantial empirical evidence that people in academia (as well as other fields) tend to grossly exaggerate how many hours they work. I know I will get substantial flak for this statement, but people saying they consistently work 60-80 hours a week are full of shit. 

The amount of time required to do a PhD varies tremendously by field. I'm not an engineer, and can't answer questions related to your field, but I can tell you that I don't work nearly that many hours, and never have throughout my PhD training, and I am considered by my peers to be productive and recently landed a full-time tenure-track position. 

The job market is BAD for PhDs generally. It's better for STEM and some social science fields (see my flair for an example of a field with a candidate:position ratio close to 1.00), especially if you want to go into industry. 

Most programs will limit the number of hours you're allowed to work in the lab to 20-30. This leaves plenty of time to get your coursework done and work on your own research. 

Doing a PhD does affect many people's mental health simply because it is seriously mentally exhausting, from coursework to comps, and especially the dissertation. It's taxing. You don't want to start if you don't have your head in the right place. I had to take a semester off during the dissertation (not uncommon) and it helped me get in the head space to finish. 

The people saying you can't have a normal life and do a PhD are simply wrong. I did my M.A./Ph.D. in 6 years while bartending off and on and maintaining a healthy, active social life. It can be done, you just have to be very good at time management and prioritizing tasks. The more you allow yourself to have a life outside the lab/office, the better your mental health will be. 

Honestly, I'd recommend not doing a PhD unless you're 100% certain this is what you want to do for the next 30-40 years. There are loads of other career options that allow you to do what you want, though few of them offer the flexibility of schedule and autonomy of a PhD, which is what many of us were attracted to when we decided to commit ourselves to the doctorate.

I'm prone to anxiety/burnout and going into the PhD I've been focused on not destroying my mental health. I work in computational biology so I have the advantage of setting my own hours (I used to do intensive lab work and it was not for me). I'm also not in the US and my stipend is enough that I don't have to do lots of teaching - I do a couple of mornings a week during the semester. 

I'm currently halfway through writing my thesis, expected to finish in a few months (3 year program).

I wake up around 7-8am, get to work sometime between 9-11am. I spend my first hour in the office drinking lots of very strong coffee, reading papers and thinking about tasks for the day. Before lunch I usually spend a while doing some project organisation, editing drafts of papers or some coding task.

I take at least an hour for lunch, drink 2 cups of tea and lots of water. In the afternoon I do the most mentally intensive task for the day, something more theoretical or an annoying computer problem. Usually my brain craps out after 2-3 hours and I go on a tea break for 30 minutes. Late afternoon I wind down my main task, work on smaller problems and then do more project organisation.

 I generally leave the office about 6pm and commute home (I can't read on public transport so I chill out listening to podcasts). I spend my evenings doing regular people stuff - cook, clean, grocery shopping, chilling out with my BF. Most days I will do an hour or two of easier writing/coding/making figures in the evening.

I go to bed around midnight and mess around on my phone until 2am, because I'm an idiot who drinks too much caffeine.

Most importantly, I only do that 8-9 hours a day unless there is a deadline. Half of those hours must always go towards something that equates to a first authorship for me. Here's the secret though, you have to actually WORK during that time. No reddit, no news feeds, no staring off into space. You have to actually force yourself to work. It's easy when you are in the lab running assays, ordering supplies, or coordinating whatever but when you're writing or doing analysis -for me at least- it's hard to do.

Kids, a husband, and a good therapist really put things into perspective for me. Also, having a plan B that doesn't involve academia in case I piss my PI/mentor off too much helps. 

I'm also super privileged to have a spouse who makes a very good salary and it helps a lot. Before kids we had a house keeper which took a huge mental load off my plate. But after kids and daycare costs well... We're pretty much tapped.

If you burn out and have a nervous breakdown you won't finish. So do everything in your power not to do that no matter what.

I agree with the top commenters here about finding a teaching focused university.

If you are in the US, there are colleges that focus on teaching first and foremost --- small liberal arts colleges or mid-sized regional universities, or even two-year institutions where teaching really matters and you're not judged based solely on your research output.

I am curious if something has happened that has made you concerned? Do you have access to a career counselor at your school that you could talk to about your concerns?

I am in Counseling Psych, so a related field, and I know a wide range of mental health providers. I am not sure that I know a single unemployed therapist. It also may depend on what you think is ""worth it"". Obviously, mental health is a relatively underpaid field for a job that has the potential to be stressful. 

In terms of the field's job outlook as a whole, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is projecting a 23% rate of growth over the next ten years (ish-- 2016-2026), which is a very fast rate of growth. - https://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/substance-abuse-behavioral-disorder-and-mental-health-counselors.htm You can also look at wage and employment trends on O*Net (if you scroll to the bottom, you can look by state, as well). - https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/21-1014.00 ",1,2018-12-30 00:24:36

(keep in mind, just b/c something isn't studied doesn't mean it's worth studying).

Are there aspects of well-understood social determinants that might affect mental health more specifically, or things about how they affect older adults that we don't know if they apply to kids/young adults? What would it be that's different about them that would cause that?

As you can see there are a million directions to go. You just need to read a lot to create a mental model of what's already been done, then expand on it or fill in the gaps.

I found myself comparing my work or life with others a lot in my first few years of grad school (7 total, 2 for MS and 5 for PhD). Once I learned that everyone works differently and that there's nothing wrong with that, I was so much happier. I learned I worked best devoting a whole morning or afternoon to writing and then spending the other half of the day on other smaller tasks. I also worked better from a coffee shop off campus, and that I had to stop caring if people thought I was unproductive because I wasn't on campus a lot (I actually graduated before most of them, they just never actually saw me doing the work).

Adding to that idea, finding an advisor who understands that everyone can be productive in different ways is also a huge boon to your success, happiness, and mental health. My advisor didn't care if I was in campus when I didn't absolutely have to be, which allowed me to work in my own ways. As long as I turned things in on time/early and gave her please ty of notice for when I'd need feedback, I was golden in her eyes. I knew other advisors who expected their students to be on campus/in the lab 9-5 every Monday-Friday, no exceptions, and they had to run all travel time by the advisor well.in advance. This would have been stifling to me, as I work so much better if I work when I know I'll be productive and take off to a trail or for a run to reenergize if I'm feeling unproductive.

Again, drawing on my own experience, **EVERYBODY** struggles whilst doing a PhD. I have had the benefit of working in two of the top departments in my field, I worked alongside dozens of PhD students both as an RA, as a PhD student myself, as a lecturer and now in academic support services. 

I am yet to find any PhD student who enjoys the process. All of us have the same problem: It is lonesome work, it is an enormous amount of information to work with and you are constantly challenging yourself to cope with it. As soon as something in your support network changes, it can trigger an avalanche of negative self-reflection. 

A few real life examples of mental health issues without going into personal detail: 

*A close friend had two supervisor changes, she managed the first one well as it was a recognised professor at the top of the field she studied, but then he got promoted and had to assign her to a junior staff member who A: didn't understand the research topic, B: didn't have a clue about the methodology. She qualified, but only because she decided to ignore the final supervisor completely, the number of times she dragged herself up from the bottom fighting and screaming is incredible, it took her five years.*

*A young, extremely bright, PhD student in my cohort was doing great, on the surface. Then he had a sports injury, or at least that is what he told everybody. Stayed away for a year, he returned just before my Viva and we had a long night in a pub - he had suffered a mental breakdown because his mother was diagnosed with cancer and he felt he couldn't support her and do his PhD. I spoke to him recently and four years later he has a viva date.*

*A friend who is now an internationally renowned professor suffered from impostor syndrome, unable to make decisions without validation from more senior staff, one of his ideas was straight-up stolen by one of them. He reached out to wellbeing and ended up receiving counselling, best thing that could have happened to him.*

*Recently I coached (as part of my role) a very senior member of staff with my current employer. She was told she had to do a PhD by publication to retain her senior leadership role. Two years in and she is under such pressure that it is bordering on insane. After the session she immediately told her line manager that she had two options: Give her two days a week to get her PhD or drop the demand to get one. She now has two days a week to get her PhD.*

Final piece of advice (ad verbatim from my supervisor, received *after* I finished my viva voce, the plonker): **A PhD is awarded as a commendation of you managing to get through this experience.** So I will add to that: Treat it as such and look after yourself.",1,2019-02-18 15:16:15

Have you tried to talk to someone ? psychologist, counselor, your supervisors (although I'm assuming they don't really care anymore). This is very likely to help you going through that difficult phase, which is, considering your message, a much bigger priority than thinking about your publication or your diploma. Protect your mental health, think about yourself, take a 1 week break (if that's possible).  


Hang in there man (woman ?), the way I see it, succeeding in Academia is not really about skills or abilities (if you didn't have those, you wouldn't have been accepted anyway), but rather determination and good partnership with your colleagues / supervisors. But sometimes it's not enough to satisfy expectations (yours &amp; Academia's), and so sometimes you just need to leave (which is OKAY, really).  


No matter what you do in the end, there is no rush. Take a deep breath, talk to someone, let it go, and then after a few days of **not working** and not thinking about work, go back to your supervisors and talk to them about your situation (both your phd and the way it affects you). Make a decision together, it will help you not to put too much pressure on yourself.

Every moment in the classroom convinces me to stay. Every hour outside of it has me wishing I loved it less so that leaving would be easier.

Personally, I'd rather be paid than promised and praised. I have had my boss forget to ""rehire"" me at the beginning of the year (after illegally terminating my contract without telling me the year before as a way to cut an administrative corner) which meant my first paycheck for the term was delayed for two months. I got paid, eventually, and that's literally all that happened. And then, *the same shit happened again the next year*.  My boss loves to *tell* me how valuable I am to the department, and how much respect he has for me, and how he has ideas for all sorts of opportunities coming down the line that I'd be great for. Promises and praise have, so far, never paid my rent.

  
It's not worth sacrificing your mental health for your *job*. You know this isn't what you want. I can't imagine doing this if I loved it any less, and I'm about at a point where loving it isn't enough any more. You should stop. You sound miserable. ",1,2019-02-13 21:41:40

It's all well and good for people to say we should complain/file title IX, but the truth is, it won't make much of a difference. It will probably ruin what's left of our careers and mental health, but it won't make a difference. Plus, at least in my case, *the institute was made aware of his misconduct*. I really like the term you used to describe these kinds of people. They are truly 'psychopaths'. There is no winning with these people. The more you interact with them, the more harm you do to yourself. Change should happen at the institution level. When a complaint is made, they should do something about it. Until such change happens, there is no point in asking victims to re-traumatize themselves.  


I do believe it's important to educate others on the kind of abuse that happens in sexual harassment, and that is one of my intentions in writing my original post. No one other than myself and this man know what actually happened and I wanted that to change. If I had known what I was going through was sexual harassment when it started, I could have stopped it from derailing my career (and life?). The crazy making nature of these situations is that the abuse is hidden. At first you think you're imagining it or that you're overreacting. I just didn't know enough to recognize the abuse when it started. I hope this post will help someone in such a situation.  


Thank you once again for taking the time to write about your experience! I love your last line!

I graduated undergrad with a 3.99 (only one A-, which was the semester where said autoimmune illness flared up really badly and put me in the hospital for a while).

Honestly I hated my classes too. I actually considered dropping out once I came to a realization that my motivation for doing well was just personal pride/achievement and a fear of failure. I only kept going because I started doing research (originally just because it's what the ""successful"" people do) and I actually ended up really liking it, thanks to a professor who gave me a lot of freedom to work on things I was interested in. I found a topic that I was passionate about and that kept me going.

I did continue to grad school and I'm planning on getting a PhD - I still dislike coursework/lecture and I still have issues with stress, motivation, and mental/physical health. But in spite of this, I'm passionate about what I do and there's nothing I'd rather be doing with my life. I hope to someday become a professor, both so I can continue do the research I love, and so I can teach and inspire students, and hopefully do what I can to make academia a less toxic/stressful environment.

However, the important point is that you need to make the decision for yourself. If a PhD won't satisfy you intellectually nor will it help you reach your career goals, there's no reason to do one. Though you have to have a realistic view of what the careers both in and out of academia are like. For example, I really like to play the guitar and compose music, possibly even more than I enjoy research -  but honestly I don't think I would enjoy the career/lifestyle of working in music even if I was successful enough to be well-off financially.

I only have experience with grad school at two institutions, but one of them was abusive and exploitative, the other is intellectually far more challenging and a lot of work, but has a vastly better learning environment and a lot of support. I can verify firsthand that some programs are tougher to get through than others, and it's not because they're ""better"" or ""harder"", but because they're dysfunctional and exploitative. 

I don't think being married makes grad school easier, for all the reasons you mention (my fiance and I are looking at LDR for a while, because he wants to do his MS in Seattle and I am in a program in Portland) but having emotional support does. 

Grad school is hard. Some programs are easier than others, and some people go into it with better scaffolding and financial support. If academia is serious about improving diverse perspectives in order to expand the scope and creativity of research, we need to provide better institutional scaffolding for those who don't have it from their families and friends.

There are frankly too many people who go into grad school because they ""think they'll like it"" or because they don't want to get a ""real job"", and these people are the ones who struggle a lot, develop horrible mental health problems, and drop out at alarmingly high rates. If you want to make it in academia, it has to be the one thing that you *absolutely, positively* want to do badly enough that all the other shit you hear about (and later, experience for yourself) won't deter you from that goal. If simply secondhand experiences are already enough to give you serious pause, that's a strong indicator that the firsthand experience may not be to your taste or liking.

if it's the job market you care about, go ahead and get a Masters, then jump ship and get a job.

I want to echo other folks’ point about directing students to student services at the school. I would tell students about these services not because I don’t necessarily want to support them (if I can), but because I’m not properly trained and equipped to support students around certain matters. I have found that when I explain it as such to students, they feel that I am considering what might be in their best interest and that I do care about their well-being. 

Most students will see that you are available but probably not the best point of contact for issues such as their mental health, addictions, or history of abuse and trauma. 

I would also add that it’s useful to establish group norms around being mindful of others— including yourself. My students will ask me, for instance, whether I am in the right space to listen to them discuss sensitive topics, and I will also be courteous and give them a heads up as well so that they can excuse themselves from class if they need to. 

Another life skill I like to emphasize to students is how to assert and define one’s boundaries.  It becomes a great opportunity for learners and teachers to share what they need of each other to be their best (but also what we can and cannot give).

I’m a bit concerned that there are so many people declining to write a letter for you. I think this could be the result of one of two things:

1. As one of the other posters mentioned, you may be asking the wrong people. When it comes to grad school applications, what matters isn’t necessarily how “famous” your letter writers are - it’s how well they know you and your work. 

Obviously, they should be TT faculty, but they don’t need to be Harold Bloom. A glowing letter from an assistant prof will work better than a lukewarm letter from a Famous faculty member.

2. You may not be presenting yourself in the best light. I would also caution you against assuming that everyone else “has it easy”. I spent undergrad dealing with an extremely difficult family situation, and many of your peers aren’t “coasting” the way you think they are.

If possible, could you take a leave of absence for a semester or year to get your house in order? It wouldn’t reduce the financial strain, but it would hopefully give you some time to deal with the family situation and your mental health.

In the end, passion is necessary, but it isn’t enough. It’s not enough to just believe that you’ll create great work if only you could get into a PhD program - you have to show your profs that you have that potential right now.

I had a 3.3 GPA in undergrad. I also got into virtually every grad school I applied to, largely on the strength of my letters and my writing sample (social science, not humanities).

1) I wanted to travel (new internship was in San Diego) and I got to spend a summer in an absolutely beautiful new environment (really great memories and good for my mental health)
2) the new internship provided a whole different set of techniques.

This kept things flexible, and ultimately allowed me to discover things that I both enjoyed and disliked.  
3) more connections! 

I found myself much more interested in the realm of research I conducted during my first internship (and am planning on pursuing grad school in this area), but I do not regret exploring the new opportunities because it was still a great learning experience all around, and lead me to discover things I DON'T want to pursue (which is valuable).

Your description of brain fog, and just *not being able to even read words on the page* feels uncomfortably familiar to me.  


But! It doesn't have to be this hard. You don't have to--and shouldn't--just muscle through this without help. I found that actually USING my university's mental health resources was essential to getting myself through my program.   


One-off therapy sessions with the school therapists were enough to get me over the wall and through whatever project I was stuck on. The sessions were often frustrating and unideal, but they were better than nothing, and, when I needed them most, they were enough.   


If you CAN set up an appointment for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, specifically, at a local clinic, that would be my best recommendation. These sessions are very different than talk therapy, and focus on developing specific strategies to help untangle and work through disruptive, anxious intrusive thoughts. You can learn how to make them stop--not all the time, but often. You can also look up Cognitive Behavioral worksheets and self-guided practice online. It honestly is the one form of therapy that I can say permanently changed the way I experience the world.

ek3avdg,t3_b97832,True,lumabugg,t2_hx5qq5k,"How much are you willing to reveal to your advisor? Honestly, it sounds like your disability accommodations are things that could fall well within needs for a variety of mental illnesses. Your need for a quiet office, meeting flexibility, and inability to go on a hike with 100 strangers could sound like accommodations for someone with anxiety/panic disorder to someone who doesn’t know your diagnosis, and, at least here in the US, anxiety is the most common mental health issue. Has your advisor spent any time in American academia recently? If so, there should be an awareness of accommodating students with mental illness as there has been a sharp increase in diagnosed college student mental illness in the US.

If you’re willing to at least tell your advisor you have “diagnosed mental health issues,” without giving your full diagnosis, you could then request something like, “Due to diagnosed mental health issues, I need a quiet place to work, experience an increased need for personal space, and may require flexibility in meeting times, with my preference being that most meetings are held in the afternoon, as this is when my health is at its best. I am also unable to attend the Gates hike, as four days of strenuous activity with strangers and no personal space will be very bad for my health.”

Or, better yet, get your doctor to write that out. It sounds to me like you know what you need, you’re just nervous about asserting yourself to ask for it because you can’t offer a full explanation for fear of how it will be perceived. So yeah, if you’re willing to at least mention that it’s a mental health issue, you can word it in a vague enough way that they won’t know what it is, just that it is a diagnosed mental health condition.",9,2019-04-04 10:30:34

Some colleges will want to see an IEP, if you have one from your high school days. You will need documentation of your condition also.

As for what to ask for- in a college setting, I’ve known that adjusted attendance expectations was an accommodation that we could offer, so that a person could take mental health days or whatever they needed. If you’re an American, you would be covered by the ADA and you may be able to request a certain block of time off on a weekday to accommodate therapy and doctor’s appointments. Of course, “reasonable accommodations” is the buzzword and you’ll probably have to do some tap dancing to get to a compromise.

Honestly, you may benefit from meeting with a psychologist and discussing what supports they have recommended to patients in the past with your disability.

Yep-- SLAC. I of course taught at an R1 as a grad student, so am familiar with the 400-600+ student classes...which is why I pursued a career at an SLAC. The largest classes we have on campus are into bio and psych lectures, and they are capped at 30. Labs at capped at 15. I teach a lot of classes with 10-15 students, and never over 25. Smallest I've taught in recent years was four.  

I have a lot of advisees (50+) but I still meet with every one of them at least once a semester, and the first years I see in class as well as individually about once a month. It's indeed a different model, and while I (obiously) think it's better, I also realize that it's very expensives and doesn't scale well.

On another thread, you comment that without an accomodation form, you will hold your distressed students to the same standards as the ones that have not complained. I hope you do this knowing that there is a cultural difference between first generation, international, and minority students on the one hand and other students in the other, where talking to an authority figure is seen as an admission of failure and weakness. These people are less likely to seek help strictly because of their cultural mores, which have absolutely nothing to do with the presence of an actual mental health issue. Not everyone has the means to go to a psychiatrist, get documentation, go to the deans, get documentation, so they can come to you to get a 24-hour extension. 

You posture as someone concerned about the scope of your work, but that's not true. You are covering your back and doing what you need to do so your ducks are in a row for administration, with 0 thought given to the student. If you were actually interested in the nature of your job, you'd know that the extremely bureaucratic approach to documentation is a problem for a considerable part of the student body, to the point that conversations about effortless perfection and asking for help become part of orientation programs. People suffer silently and do not get the help they need because they know that somewhere there is a person like you that will not believe them and will automatically think the worst, unless an adult tells them that the student is right.

So I'm proactive. During that first class of the semester, where we go over the syllabus, class policy, university policy, and all of that, I also add in a spiel about campus resources. I include tutoring, the writing center, the health center, and mental health/counseling resources. I don't make a huge deal of it, but I treat it like other ""things that might come up and derail your success, here's some resources that will help."" My campus also has a secondary office that specifically helps students who need extended accommodations that aren't ""disability"" per se - things like extended absences for health reasons - but most students never hear about it unless they go digging; I make sure that's on the list too.

I teach in a creative field, so we're a little more informal and have smaller classes, which makes it easier for me to try to help students without formally ""intervening."" I use the 20 minutes or so while students are trickling in to strike up conversations about whatever - movies, the football game, the weird protest we had to walk by in the quad - and get to know students as people. I also often kick off class with something interesting but unrelated, so that stragglers can get in before the bulk of teaching. It's usually an article or video about our industry, or some parody clip, but once or twice per semester, I include some sort of ""college advice"" article that's not dumb or cheesy.

I see students for about 2.5 hours per week if they consistently come to class.

Occasionally there are deeper interactions that come up- such as the rare student who will come to office hours, or those students who take multiple classes with me so I just get to know them better over time. Sometimes mental health is discussed and I become aware of challenges they are dealing with. It also sometimes happens that students email me to tell me that they have been struggling to come to class or complete assignments due to mental health challenges. When this happens, I do my best to accommodate through giving extensions on deadlines or allowing make-up exams.

Every now and then you’ll have to work extra here and there (evenings and weekends) but the biggest part of PhD life is balance. But remember it’s a marathon, not a sprint! Short term goals are your friend in this path.

In all honesty it’s not so bad once you figure out the kind of schedule that fits you and your project. And reading peoples experiences on the internet should be taken lightly. In my experience it’s kind of like looking at a reverse social media, everyone posts the best version of themselves on fb/insta/etc. through selfies and holiday pics and engagements or marriages and babies and if you read it thinking that’s how everyone lives 24/7 you’d be dead wrong. However on reading people’s PhD experience it’s a lot more common to see stories of struggle, and how draining it is, or pressing people’s mental health.

I have to echo what others are saying - 11-13 hour workdays are excessive. Of course, there are always times you'll have to work long hours, but consistently working that much will lead to a very real burnout. 
Realistically I work 8-10 hour days regularly. Balancing life and grad school is always a challenge, but it is absolutely possible. I changed my schedule around a lot until I found a system that worked for me, for example, I get up early and go to the gym. This way I get my workout in (which is also key for managing my mental health!) and then I'm far more productive when I get to lab since I've been up for hours. Because of that, I can usually finish all my wet lab work and most computer work at a reasonable time.
Get home, make dinner, relax. Taking this time to unwind from the day is just as important as working; it will increase your productivity and keep you from burning out. 
As far as errands and what not go, take them in chunks. Car maintenance can often be done on the weekend, so set aside a Saturday morning and go get it done. I'm fairly lucky that I work in a lab that's independent and laid-back, so if I have to run to the bank in the middle of the day, no one cares. If you cannot do this, go during lunch. 
As for grocery shopping, we take advantage of the online ordering and pickup services, like from Walmart, where pickup is free. Not only do we save money from not perusing every aisle and buying on a whim, but we also only spend 30 minutes running to pick up our groceries vs hours otherwise. 

But honestly, take a moment to re-evaluate working 11-13 hour days. This is excessive, regardless of the reason. Making time to do other things in life is essential, and there's no reason to be working so much (unless, as others have stated it's a toxic environment).",1,2019-03-22 19:06:49

I work 8-9 hours/ day and occasionally (once /month or so ) go til 12 hours. This gives you time. Remember while you are getting degree you are also living your life. I also don't have a pet and slack on cleaning more than I should but this doesn't seem to be a function of free time. I call my parents/friends on my walk to/from work which is about 10-15 min. My PhD program is flexible and I make my own hours so leaving for appointments isn't really an issue as long as I'm still productive. 

I am also sensitive to when I am and am not being productive and work to maximize those hours. For example 8am - 1pm I am good at writing and can focus where as in the afternoon is better for monotonous lab work. I mainly meal prep so cook 1-2 times a week and put it tupperware but when my SO lived nearby we cooked a lot. 

Also. This is 4-5 years of my life. If I can't make time to myself as a non married no kids  PhD student, how will I in the future as hopefully a new faculty / parent.

That said, obviously, it is not a great idea to barge into a crowded room and shout at the top of your lungs ""I am coping with mental health issues! This is a difficult thing and is occasionally a serious struggle for me!"" is necessarily a great idea. On the other hand, knowing that it *is* possible to have a mature, healthy, and productive discussion about such topics with one's advisor is great.  

When I was working on my Master's degree, my advisor virtually never gave me any meaningful feedback. My self-doubt absolutely terrorized me, and it took the better part of two years until I felt comfortable with the work I was doing. Looking back, it could have been much better had I spoke up after a few months and just told him, ""Hey. I am not managing to get a sense of how well/poorly I am doing from the feedback you have been giving me, and this is making me worry--perhaps irrationally?--that I am standing on thin ice with you. Do you think anything can be done about this going forward?"", then I would have spared myself a year of daily stress. At some point it got so bad that I was having (thankfully very mild) anxiety attacks once or twice per week, and was seriously considering taking a semester off for health reasons.

My advisor didn't even know I was stressing so much. When we had a concluding discussion after I successfully finished the degree, he told me he was always happy with my work. In retrospect, the reality is that he was still new to being a professor, I was among his first students, and, by my understanding, he was so concerned that his feedback would be mistaken to be unnecessarily harsh that he tried to say as little as possible.  

I suffered for no reason, because I was too scared or embarrassed to speak up.  

One final thing. Although I do not openly announce my mental health history, I try to keep an atmosphere that encourages people to speak up if it seems necessary.

I’m doing a PhD now (with attendance issues of my own), and although I wasn’t in MH inpatient recently, I was in one for 8 months and essentially came out of it one month before moving alone to a new country (UK) and starting my undergrad degree. So I guess I have both of those things but not together. 

I guess what’s most important is, how are you doing now? Was the treatment helpful? Or, at least, have you figured out what the issues are and some steps towards solving them? 

I get from your post that you seem to be apprehensive of going back partly because of shame. I understand that, but at the same time, you shouldn’t feel that way ideally. I’ll bring out the cliche “what if it was a physical illness” argument (forgive me) - you were unwell enough to require inpatient stay in a hospital. They don’t give that for no good reason or people who aren’t really ill (especially in the UK - I’ve spent several hundred hours with mental health crisis teams since but never been admitted again). The fact that you want to and are planning to go back at all is amazing for a start. But you can’t go from being in hospital 24/7 for a few weeks to just charging at work again, and you’re not expected to, same as with a physical illness. 


You need to have healthcare plans in place first of all: How are you going to work towards feeling better? You need a main plan and all the adjustments to your life you need to implement bit by bit. Then, you need to work with your university, and with your supervisor(s), as they’re the ones (other than yourself) who are going to ensure your success. Are there any adjustments that the university can make, any helpful services they can offer? 

With your supervisor, have you considered letting them know of your fears of going back? Maybe you could set up a plan with them, some goals to achieve that aren’t “start up immediately at 60mph and 60 hours a week”. You need to not feel ill again and get worse for a start, but you also need to recover from what you’ve just been through. I’ll say it again, it’s not nothing, and it’s not worth dismissing. 

If you work with healthcare, the university and its services, as well as your supervisor(s), you should be able to find a way back to work that works for you. You’ll need an adjustment period where you get back up to speed and maybe suffer a few dips, but beyond that I hope you start to feel like a regular old PhD student again!

ej2wflm,t3_b3vaom,True,pugaholic,t2_6mmnm,"My mental health was severely affected during my undergraduate. It was never bad enough to go inpatient, but there were times I was suicidal and close to dropping out. I went on a year abroad but had a breakdown, came home for a rest and physically couldn’t go back - panic attack at the airport, couldn’t get on the plane, etc. I had to deal with the fallout (I was employed on my year abroad) and get it all signed off at university so that I could come back for my final year. It was absolutely awful and one of the worst times of my life. I didn’t leave my house for weeks. I completely sympathise with you and also understand the desire to get back to “normal” while faced with crippling anxiety over even dealing with it. 

I will break it down into some practical steps for you, or what helped me at least. 

* Go to your GP, and get a medical certificate confirming your inpatient stay and/or a letter stating current circumstances. This documentation will probably be necessary for you to continue onwards. 
* Contact your university mental health resources, wellbeing centre, or otherwise. Send an email describing your situation and asking for help. They may be able to liaise on your behalf with your department, offer general advice, and generally support you. 
* How is your relationship with your supervisor? I found what helped me the most was working with my tutor, who thankfully I trusted. She was my first point of contact and took the lead in arranging the meetings that I needed. Send them an email describing the situation and ask for help. Keep it brief if necessary. 
* Bring someone with you to meetings with your university if you can. I took my mum, lol, which was embarrassing, but I was in no fit state to deal with anything and she was my advocate. I barely remember the meetings we attended and she took notes and made sure she was on top of things for me. If you have someone who can help you, a friend or partner or relative, lean on them. If you don’t have someone like that or it’s inappropriate for you, that’s why it’s good to contact wellbeing services and your tutor/supervisor first off. 
* Find your university guide and regulations surrounding doctoral study and the rules about sickness etc. 
* Take all the time you need to get yourself together.
* Send emails if it’s too overwhelming to step foot on campus for now. Sending emails may help you with the word soup as well. 

You can do it. Take it one baby step at a time. First I would prioritise sending a few emails and booking an appointment with your GP. Then see what comes of that and you can arrange in person meetings when you can. I found my university 100% supportive and kind in this process. There are rules and guidelines in place for this kind of thing and I believe you will be able to reattend and get back on track - with the medical certificate etc, I think they basically have to let you. It’s only been a month or so, right? That’s a drop in the bucket. They might advise you go back to part time, or extend your duration a bit, I’m not sure - /r/AskAcademiaUK might have more advice on this front. 

I know you’ve heard it a lot, but it WILL be okay! Prioritise your mental health and take it slow and steady and you can get through this!!! I believe in you! ",1,2019-03-21 23:41:22

Our relationship didn’t change, although I do think my respect for them went up for ensuring they had the resources they needed and were able to advocate for themselves. 

No accommodations were needed and I made sure they knew about the services on campus for mental health support that they were already paying for. 

I’m not a therapist, but I know the email and number for on campus support and share them often as part of my regular intros now since few students realize the service is there. ",1,2019-03-21 22:46:30
eitmpvq,t1_eily6le,True,executionofflash,t2_lcpxsev,"Of course! I do not by any means want to talk you out of doing a PhD if that is what you really, really want to do. However, I do think you need to be aware of the negative aspects before signing up for a program. I genuinely love what I do, but I have still struggled with mental health problems in graduate school.

As to the hours: I regularly work 11-13 hour days. As in, I get to my office/lab around 8-9 and leave between 10pm to midnight. I am not being forced to stay for that amount of time, but I have deadlines to meet and work that has to be done. As a graduate student, you are in charge of your own time. I have to run experiments, analyze my experiments, read papers constantly (I need to know what has been done in my topic, what is currently being done in my topic, and what is current surrounding my topic - where is the research going?). I also have to take courses until I am finished with the course requirements, so I have that homework and studying on top of my research responsibilities. Neither research or coursework will slow down for the other. You may even have to TA or teach courses, grade papers, hold office hours - all rewarding things, but all giant time sucks.

As to the mental health aspect: Academia goes hand in hand with rejection. You will have research meetings with your advisor and will regularly have negative feedback. Without negative feedback, you will never grow; however, after some time, it will build and become increasingly discouraging. You will have papers rejected from journals, maybe even rejected from conferences. You will have weeks where you cannot meet all or any of your deadlines and your advisor will push you to get your work done. There will be times when the research method you were following will be incorrect and you will have to start all over again. You will hit a wall at some point, it has even been named the ""three year slump"".  

I would encourage you only to do a PhD if it is something you very much want to do, rather than an escape from something you don't want to do. Without using a doctorate to follow your passion, the negatives will far outweigh the positives. ",1,2019-03-18 19:14:45

Could the student be suffering from a learning disability, negative mental health flare, or a personal life crisis? Absolutely, that could be a feasible possibility. Is that my problem? Not really.

I'd agree that taking a break is good - often just stepping back and giving yourself time to not think about it either gives you renewed interest, or clarifies that your purpose is elsewhere. Any academic knows what it is like to feel as you feel, especially someone who has worked their way up the ladder to be a PI. I'd let them know you respect them and your work, but that issues in your personal life and/or mental health (however much you feel like sharing) mean you need to take a step back.

As for your programme, honesty is always the best way to handle this.

ei6ts7k,t3_azc2zd,True,Vaporware371,t2_q3512,"The literature review places your work in the context of past research that's been done. Let's say your thesis follows the following format:

1. Description of the problem you're trying to solve/explore/research.
2. History of other attempts at the problem, with descriptions of their success and shortcomings.
3. Your approach, and what it improves upon.
4. Your results/conclusion.

The literature review would be #2. What have others already done? What have they shown, and what gaps remain in the research?

To do this properly, you have to step into the reader's shoes a bit, and anticipate some of their questions. Speaking to your example, what I might be wondering:

* What are other examples of mental-health apps (or computer programs) in the literature?
* What is in the literature about people who can't afford treatment?

In terms of types of sources, you ideally want to cite the primary source (this is true in general) for any experiment. Also, you r*eally* want to trace your thread of thought back (if possible) to the first example of this idea in the literature. Were people doing this kind of work in the 1950s? 1920s? 1820s? For your app example, you'd be hard-pressed not to include Dr.  Weizenbaum's work in the 1960s. And then you go from there.

Obviously it is space permitting: you don't need to reference every paper in the field. However, *if every paper you read seems to cite a particular article/experiment*, it probably merits inclusion, because it is clearly important to the field. While you can be somewhat sparse when going through the history of your work, you should be thorough regarding the recent developments in the field. It is ok to ""mass-cite"" sets of very similar publications, in the name of being thorough, as long as you don't paint with too broad a brush.

Going back to the concept of anticipating the reader. You never know whose hands something you write will fall into. It's easy to get comfortable with your research group and thesis advisor: they will have read many of the same articles as you, and shared many conversations with you. When someone reads your paper, you have no idea what background knowledge they're coming in with. In particular, you need to anticipate:

* Someone who is completely new to the field. What reading do they need to do in order to get up to speed in the subject matter? All of those sources should be described in the literature review.
* Someone who is currently doing work in the field at another group/lab, and has put out recent publications. If you listed publications from 9 researchers who are active in your field, and you happen to meet the 10th researcher (or he happens to be your advisor's friend), you are going to find yourself in an awkward conversation as to why they weren't included in your sources.",1,2019-03-10 04:56:52

It was never grade related, but certainly discussed disposition and attitude. One professor erroneously forwarded a grad fac thread to the grad student list serv, and that had a really profound impact on the cohort. 

The message was describing a student that had just graduated. The content of the message was negative, and discussed the student as a slow, stubborn learner that never took advice. Apologies were made for this, but it really clued in the students as to how faculty were thinking about us. 

The environment afterward was much more toxic. People stopped talking to one another about work. I know a lot of people kept their mental health struggles to themselves for fear of that information being spread throughout the department.

ehrvglw,t3_ax1r1e,True,jenesaisquoi,t2_3xi0l,"As someone with an invisible disability who also has it pretty well managed (although I am not as successful, grade-wise, as you are), I try to use my less high-stakes needs to normalize accommodations. That said, I don't get accommodations letters every semester. It's been a while since I've had a course with exams, so I generally don't need any accommodations other than maybe a homework extension or final project extension if shit hits the fan. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also mentor a bunch of undergrads, and some of them have had really shitty experiences with professors dealing with disabilities. Our student disabilities office and support services office do a great job advocating for students when they learn about these things, but there's definitely a lot of judgement about anxiety disorders. I picked an advisor who I knew would be accepting of my issues, but I also think a lot of the PIs here would be terrifying to explain that productivity was low due to mental health issues. I like to hope that my success and openness about my issues can help change that, but I do fear that being too open might kick me in the butt one day for employers who don't want to deal with it. Luckily I'm not trying to do tenure-track. 

&amp;#x200B;

I like to challenge people who look down on accommodations by using physical health as an analogy. I guess the professor who called it a crutch might not be convinced since uh, they don't seem to understand that crutches are useful and used only by people who need them. I think it's important to challenge people when they make comments like that, not only for you and your continued success, but for the students who follow after you who might not have the record of success to give them confidence and might not have the energy available to fight for their rights/education. Maybe you don't have that energy right now, and that's fine too.

And this is coming from a former student with undiagnosed ADHD who confided a but too much in some professors.  I think a good first step is to contact health services and speak to someone in mental health there that can give you good advice on how to approach this issue with the student in a way that won’t make the student feel worse or shamed.

ehrdd3v,t1_ehpuvf1,True,Sublixt,t2_61jn5,"&gt; Have you reflected how you are able to do this(achieving happiness ) while other people cant?

I can't speak for why other are/aren't happy, but I've focused on maintaining my physical and mental health first, and everything else second. I knew a lot of fellow grad students who never ate well, never worked out, and worked 10 hours a day. This is not conducive for writing a good thesis, and it showed time and time again. People in my grad program who did well worked effectively when they were working and took care of themselves.

&gt; Have you been lucky with PhD and postdoc advisors?

I started researching doctoral advisors for more than a year prior to applying. Not just their work, but also the kind of person they are. For my particular advisor, I watched his online lectures and saw how he interacted with questions, and then I emailed back and forth for several months. I knew he would be a good advisor even before I applied. 

For postdoc, I was very social in grad school and had met him multiple times at conferences. So that was an easy choice. 

&gt; Have you encountered hardships that people complained in this sub?

Stuff like sexism, harassment, racism? No. Being born a white male has advantages there.

money? Not really I made sure to plan ahead, and I saved up money before going to grad school. Also I took my girlfriend with me. She got a job in the same city, and we always made sure to be saving money.

Dead end projects? Yeah, of course I had dead end projects. But they weren't the only one I was working on. I knew there would be potential for me to not be able to figure out a proof. So I was always working on 2-3 different ones, and I would make progress on at least one. 

imposter syndrome? No. My advisor helped me set realistic goals and split large projects into smaller tasks that could be accomplished in days rather than months. I could always see at the end of the week where I started and what I accomplished. I understood it was a marathon and not a sprint. I didn't need to see the entire progress all at once.

 &gt; And how did you engineered your luck?

I made sure I knew what I was getting into. I had an advisor in undergrad who really helped me understand the hardships that came with a PhD, and I prepared for them. So when they happened, I had a plan and worked through them. And in many cases, the preparation prevented them from ever happening like in the case of money. ",1,2019-03-04 11:11:43

I was first diagnosed at 17 and my exact diagnosis is *still* up for debate. My symptoms would partially satisfy a hell of a lot of conditions and some of those are satisfied enough to warrant a diagnosis, but none are perfect. But the diagnosis doesn't actually matter because the symptoms are the same regardless. The accommodations are there to help me with my symptoms, not with the name of the condition, which is why we only disclose our symptoms to the disability office. 

&gt;I worry that if I feel good then maybe I should ditch the accommodations

You have to get used to trusting other people's assessments sometimes. 

If I feel like an imposter, then I look to my achievements and to others' opinions of me, and I trust that those will be a good representation of my skills. If I feel like I don't deserve my accommodations, I look to my mental health team and all of my medical documentation, and I trust that those will be a good representation of the difficulties I face.

My diagnosis may alter slightly, but none of what I have been diagnosed with is trivial and the decision to give me those labels isn't made lightly by medical professionals. They went to medical school. I didn't. ",1,2019-03-04 04:43:19

Realistically, I have diagnoses that are certain enough that I'd get accommodations anyway, but even trained psychiatrists/psychiatrists give conflicting information sometimes. 

I have experiences very similar to yours, though. Stress is a big trigger, which means that anything bad that's going to happen is going to manage to happen at the worst possible time.

It may be worth having a conversation with your advisor about how to best use your efforts and talents--e.g., if there are other things you can research that can have a bigger impact. But it's OK to be researching something where you may not have the impact you want. A favorite quote of mine is ""When nothing we do matters, all that matters is what we do.""

Now I'm more persuaded by the ""never read the comments"" line of thinking (referencing specifically, the garbage comments often under an article posted on the web).

Other comments on RMP say I'm a great professor and some even say I'm super hot. So obviously those comments are 100% accurate.

In all seriousness, you are going to get a lot of feedback and criticism in your academic career from many different places. It's part of the job.

Most of my (tiny) cohort were older, nontraditional students. The two students who ""dropped out"" were both pretty traditional students in some respect. The first person was very young, 20 years old, just graduated with an MA and had no real world experience, and had never even held a real job, let alone ever had their first drink (so they said). This person didn't even finish their first week, because ""Everybody was always talking about what they wanted to research and had ideas, and I had no idea what I wanted to do. I just knew I liked [our discipline]."" So, not a good reason to go to grad school, IMO, but I don't think it's a good reason to acquiesce to defeat either; this person surely could have given it a shot and left by a different means.  

So, to answer your question, if you don't know what you want to research by the time you apply for grad school, I would do some SERIOUS thinking. I wouldn't recommend it, but if you're committed, at least ask yourself these questions:

1. WHY do you even want to go to grad school? What is your end goal? Your end goals in academia can be various, and have different requirements. For example, if you want to research at a top-tier institution like Harvard, you are going to need to go publish your butt off and get a PhD and publish some books. But, if you want to teach instead of research, having an Master's allows you to teach at (some) community colleges (but this is changing). A Ph.D., however, is requisite at most research institutions, in order to teach undergraduates and/or graduate students. Even as a tenure-track professor, you are not guaranteed to teach grad classes (I might have this wrong...).  
2. Have you talked to other grad students, in real life, just about their daily experiences? We are helpful here at /r/AskAcademia, but you might want to browse /r/GradSchool specifically, and maybe take a gander at occupational related publications about academia over at /r/HigherEducation.  
3. Are you in a committed relationship or married? Will your partner be willing to suck it up with you for 2-8 years, and move probably across the country with you?  
4. What is your fall back plan? A lot of people fail out or drop out of graduate school, period. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It's hard, it's sometimes brutal, but everyone has a different experience.  
5. How willing are YOU to stick to a goal for 2-4 years, or more if you decide to pursue a Ph.D. beyond a Master's?  
6. Do you mind being poor? Constantly broke? Taking out student loans?  
7. Do you have kids? 
8. Do you intend to go to school for a Master's or Ph.D.? Part-time or full-time? Do you plan to have a ""real job"" while going to grad school? 
9. Did you do well in undergraduate courses? 
10. What makes YOU special? How will you market/sell yourself to admissions committees? 
11. What DRIVES you? What is the reason you wake up in the morning? 
12. DO YOU HAVE A SUPPORT SYSTEM? Also, how well are you with managing your schedule, mental health, and physical wellness? (I have ""real"" anxiety, formally diagnosed by health professionals [contest it sure but this isn't the time or place], *and it's not like grad school ever made life any **easier**!* Real talk, but people don't often want to say/hear this).

Think long and hard, talk to people. Browse the other forums. Talk to your professors. Talk to grad students at the institution where you go to school/went to school.

It's nice knowing my few options, and being prepared to be more competitive on the job market is better learned sooner rather than later.

I'm one year from graduation and seriously considering redoing my master and if possible advance to PhD abroad since I have this feeling that I've learned practically nothing in my years here, but at least I have a better-looking master degree which could serve as a higher jump off point for me.

Sadly publishing in bogus journals appears to be the norm here in China as the journal is actually recommended by my supervisor (he himself has published in it as well) as the whole publish or perish thing is even worse here, with master students required to publish at least one paper in journals just to graduate. I do believe my supervisor had good intentions though - my OCD (and the general anxiety that inevitably comes with it) is still here and only somewhat controlled with a huge dose of medications, and back then, before I submitted my paper for publication, the anxiety of being unable to graduate for not having a published paper had been tearing me apart; getting it published at least helped a little. Finding out that the journal is bogus has been disappointing though.

djz1dmz,t1_djypvxe,,majorshake,,"It was pretty intense most days - I worked afternoons/evenings only for a tutoring agency doing homework help for high school English students (luckily, I had an office students would come to, instead of going to people's homes). Typical day was 9-1 study, then take a short break and prepare for work, then work 3.30 (had to leave uni at 2.30) until between 7-9 (depending on students).

One issue was that I never could get on a roll with studying - I'd have to leave halfway through doing something to go to work. I missed out on a lot of optional but important stuff at uni (reading groups, etc) and I didn't have time to do any research on the side that could result in a publishable paper or two. Because of this, I also always felt like I was falling behind, so I basically didn't take a day off for a year and a half. It didn't help that my supervisor's idea of helping me improve is telling me to ""work harder and go out less"".

The second issue comes out of the first - because of working all the time, I stopped seeing people, and I stopped taking care of my body which took a pretty serious toll on my health, both mental and physical.

I think overall, it's possible to work up to 15 hours while doing a Master's degree, while avoiding some of the issues I'd had. You need to be prepared for it though, and know what you want out of it - don't let things get in the way.

When I switched to working full-time I was at the point where the heavy intellectual lifting was already done - I was just writing at that point, and I'd already had a handle on my work. 

If you're good at managing your time and if you have a supportive supervisor, you'd be fine - however, you need to make sure you keep on top of the work, and don't procrastinate. I did it - it kinda sucked (ok, it really sucked), but it's doable.

That kind of stuff goes by the umbrella term 'case management,' and you wouldn't have to do anything like that in private practice as an LCSW if you didn't want to. But you'd probably have to learn about it during your MSW, and possibly do some of it during your provisional period depending on what kind of work you're doing (e.g. some non-profit / government jobs have a therapy and case management component). My general suggestion would be to read through the curricula of a couple different MSW programs to get a feel for it, and see if the balance between general principles courses vs. mental health courses would be workable for you.  And also maybe see if there are any LCSWs in your social / professional network who you could bounce a few questions off.",2,2017-06-26 18:28:41
djfemdy,t3_6jljau,,ulfgar,t2_759oo,"I can speak a bit to the LCSW question. You're right that will almost certainly have to get an MSW degree first. Licensing varies by state, but I'm not aware of any states that grant LCSWs to folks who don't have an MSW from an accredited school. 

Can I ask what turns you off about social work? My understanding is that most social work schools have 2-3 different tracks students can follow. For example, there may be a clinical track with more mental health training and a non-profit management / advocacy track.  But you're right that'll still have to engage pretty deeply with social work as a discipline either way.

After that there's usually a period of provisional licensure while you accrue clinical hours and pass a licensure exam. I know some states allow provisional licensees to do direct practice with supervision, but others may require you to be fully licensed.

I can't address the other types of certification you mentioned, but an LCSW is a flexible degree that would allow you to do private practice after 2-3 years training (including the provisional period). You'll get enough mental health training in grad school, but you might get more / be able to focus more on a particular school if you pursue a less generalist degree.

If you want to do research, the best thing you can do to achieve that goal is to do research. Make it your goal to join a lab that does mental health related research. I would recommend trying to join a lab by the start of your sophomore year. If it's possible for you financially, it would also be great if you could volunteer over the summer.

You will make the impact you make - depending on where you settle you will make some impact but nobody starts work thinking that particular petri dish will get them the Nobel prize.

Figure out what you are interested in and find work in that - it will make an impact, but figuring out why enzyme X does y is just as important as figuring out which dose of drug z works best in schizophrenia. 

Everything is connected, everything makes an impact. You can make an impact by being a clinician and working with a person and making them feel better, you can make an impact by exploring psychological models, you can make an impact in a wet lab working on neurons or on drug activity, but it depends on what you want to do.

If you want to work in a lab and work on new compounds you can do that by taking pharmacology, if you are interested in neuronal behaviour in mental health do more neurology (beyond the field your neuro prof might work on), if you want to work clinically work towards a degree in clinical psychology (or go to med school and become a psychiatrist).

You are in your first year, you got time to work this out, to explore different things, to settle, to realize you settled wrong, to resettle, to get your graduate school degree, you start a job, to hate it, to find a new job, to love that one... you got all the time in the world.

dj8yuex,t3_6iruyn,,dataispower,t2_ekpaj,"&gt; he doesn't see much research related to it in his field

That professor must mean in their very specific subfield of neurology. Each professor will be in a certain field, like neurology, but will mainly only do research in a very small subfield. For instance, my advisor is in robotics, but is mostly just focused on how to move certain types of robot arms.

&gt; Should I just get a normal job and write or do research and write

In order to make an informed decision on this, you need to get some research experience. Ask your professors if there is any way you can volunteer in their lab. Express your interest in mental health and they *might* be able to find a way to tie your volunteer work to mental health. Or, ask if there is another professor at the school that is more focused in that area. Don't forget that each professor should be listed on the department's website, and they should have individual pages that outline their research. Search those pages for a while and see if you can find somebody that lists mental health. Another option is to check if there is any class related to mental health at your school, and then contact the instructor. The main thing is that you just have to keep trying to contact people.

&gt; I just want your opinion(s) on what field I should go into If i wanted to make the biggest impact on Mental Health.

This really depends on you. Mental health is a field that can be examined from several different viewpoints - psychology, psychiatry, neurology, etc. You can probably even study how to affect mental health with human-computer interaction. What field you go into will depend on how you want to look at mental health - do you want to study it from a mood disorder viewpoint, or from a chemical imbalance viewpoint (I am not in medical fields, sorry if this is not the correct terminology for the neurology side of things)? Do you want to focus on understanding the symptoms or do you want to study medication for mental health problems? These are questions that should be answered before making a decision on what field you focus on.

Here is what I'd recommend:

1) Find a professor (or *all* of the professors) at your school studying mental health from any field, and contact them about helping with any research they do.

2) Take a survey of classes related to mental health: psychology, biology, chemistry, and maybe more fields depending on your school. Take several courses in each (if possible) to see which of these fields you enjoy the most, and figure out how that field can contribute to understanding mental health. ",3,2017-06-22 14:31:11

Oxbridge undergrad has this weird aura that makes you feel like nowhere else will be nearly as good, but you'd be surprised - I've studied at other Russell group and non- Russell now too and have had my eyes totally opened to different teaching methods, different research groups styles and different university set ups. I'd hugely recommend moving if at all possible, even if just from Oxford to Cambridge or vice versa, because it definitely gives you a more full experience.

And in the U.K., you can actually face a bias against people who have done UG/masters/PhD all at Oxbridge. Their standard of teaching is often actually not that great in many departments despite great research as, as you know, teaching undergrads is looked upon as something you have to do to research rather than culturally appreciated in many departments, and when hiring lecturers universities absolutely know this. Some teaching experience especially elsewhere really helps!

Edit: Also, a useful point to note - anecdotally, out of my friendship group, the dropout rate was far higher amongst those who stayed at the same institution. Doing 7 years in a small university town with the same fellows is surprisingly hard mentally, and mental health isn't particularly well catered for at Oxbridge anyway.

As to your second point, I'm definitely not looking to just go and get pictures of me holding some random orphans and doing some voluntourism. However, I do hope to be involved in building educational tools in the future and thought that if I were to take some time off, having hands on experience in this could be a good use of the time and could help me shape how I think about my future research.

dlz0so4,t3_6vbu1a,,Drbananabeak,,"Let me start by saying - I understand you wanting to take a gap year, however ""I worked hard for 5 and a half years"" is not going to be a very strong argument, because you know what? Most of us here who are actual academics and not students have been working ""non stop"" for at least 15+ years.

I honestly think your phD is not a good time to take a whole year out, depending on your funding, it may also be a complete impossibility, but here are some things I do think you should do:

- get mental health help to manage your anxiety. Anxiety doesn't have anything to do with you working many years in a row, and it may not get better by just taking a chunk of time out. Learn some techniques to manage the anxiety and keep it at bay.

- see if you can do a short volunteer project such as 6 weeks or so. You will be much more likely to get your supervisor to be ok with you taking a summer out and you will get the same experience. Most volunteer organisations are pretty terrible and the ""gap year"" organisation where you hug an orphan for 2 weeks and then travel through Uganda are an actual problem for the orphanages and a real source of distress to the orphans. Similarly some of the teaching companies have been heavily criticized for giving very subpar teaching to the ""poor children"" and feeling like heroes whilst doing it. There are however some efforts that are worth while - replenishing deforested areas with seeds for example. Look into things where you do not affect children's lives if possible (I feel very strongly about this having seen the damage done by volunteer companies when I spent a summer as a physician in sub-Saharan Africa).

- find something besides studying that you can do for the length of your phD (and beyond). A sport, a hobby, a craft or some local volunteering (there are soup kitchens everywhere! You don't need to go to Sierra Leone for it) - something that will help you through tough times because it is always there to keep your mind off things. Even if you take a gap year in 4 years time when you are getting ready to wrap up your thesis, a gap year will just be something you did a while ago and that won't recharge your batteries, whilst a hobby or volunteering locally will still be with you.",36,2017-08-22 15:55:20
dlz0owo,t3_6vbu1a,,penguinberg,,"I am in the same position you are regarding being in a STEM PhD program at a high ranking university. I have anxiety that flares up in particular when I am doing lab work, both last summer at a national lab internship and now here in grad school.

I'm not a psychologist and I'm certainly not you, but I know that if I were to take a year off, I would feel better (anxiety-wise) for the year, and then everything would come flooding back when I returned. My anxiety (and I imagine yours as well) is not the result of being in grad school or working straight through undergrad into grad school, but the result of certain ways of thinking my entire life: the way I was raised, the expectations I put on myself in my schoolwork and labwork, that sort of thing. To change those things and work on improving my anxiety, the things that help are (1) talking to somebody, like a therapist or a friend even, and (2) going back into lab and working through the issues one day at a time. [Edit: (3) Doing the things you mentioned here, like teaching or volunteering, once or twice a week as a way to relieve stress.]

Ultimately, I think there's a difference between taking a two-week vacation meant to relieve some of the stress of work and take a ""mental health day"" so to speak, versus taking a year off and ignoring the things that give you anxiety. That year off isn't going to help you deal with the issues that you're having now.

well, first things first: you've got to take care of yourself, seems like your mental health is not optimal, and has been weighing down on the odds of you finishing. I understand there is more than just this (you mentioned finances) but to be honest the way you describe your relationship with your advisors suggests that you've had unrealistic goals. In phd, you're the driver. 

Also keep in mind it's ok to not have a phd, and it's ok to leave a phd program. I heard the figure of 1/3 of phd candidates never finishing their program (I don't know if this is accurate) but you're not at all an isolated case. 

I think you've outlined your trajectory quite well (it's harsh so it must be honest), and to be frank it does not seem (at least in my field, seems the same in yours) to be productive and consistent enough to be recruited as a permanent research/teaching staff (although YMMV of course).

BUT

There are plenty of great careers for people with an understanding for research and/or a knack for teaching. I know of a few scientific writers/journalists, technical manual writers, commercial agents, development engineers,... They're all essential to the scientific community.

I think it boils down to talking to your advisors about your ideas and plans as soon as possible. It's an essential part of the process and there might be enough time to re-adjust the plan to fit with your new project. It's worth a shot if you also want to feel like you have not ""wasted"" your time (you have not).

dn5vn3a,t3_70ti5j,,PurrPrinThom,,"When you’re applying for a PhD, you shouldn’t be looking for a program, you should be looking for a supervisor. While your program is important in that the school and the program you choose will affect what funding is available to you and (if in North America) what coursework will be required, your supervisor trumps all of that. 

There’s no point in finding a program you love if it doesn’t have a supervisor who is interested in, or able to properly supervise your topic. That should be your number one priority. Since you already have a specific interest and fairly clear idea of what you should do, you should seek out the academics who have published work that resonates with you, and see where they are. Your former/current professors will be invaluable in this regard.

In terms of finding a good fit, generally that means making sure that you feel comfortable in the program/school. This of course means finding a supervisor that you feel you can work with – not just a supervisor whose research interests align with yours, but someone you feel you can work with. It also means seeking out a department that potentially holds something else for you: if your supervisor goes on sabbatical, or unexpectedly falls ill, will you be alone in miserable in your department or will there be someone else you can temporarily turn to? Likewise location. You cannot underestimate the amount that location matters. While moving halfway across the country to a small city where you know no one and there’s very little going on in said city may seem like not a big deal when considering schools, actually moving there might make you feel isolated and alone and negatively impact your mental health, and therefore productivity.

The point is, you shouldn't be looking for schools, you should be looking for researchers you feel you can work with.",6,2017-09-18 10:32:23

dqsxblk,t3_7hj7jt,,the_Stick,,"Once upon a time before I entered graduate school when I was working as a research associate, I met a girl who was in graduate school.  She asked me to help her change the rotors in the ultracentrifuge and I gladly helped.  Then I was suddenly her ""new best friend"" - whenever she needed help with anything, she came looking for me.  It was noticeable that she had latched on to me to the point where my friends were commenting.  There were some behaviors that raised red flags, so I politely distanced myself, but helped her out occasionally.

Gradually, I came to know more about her, especially since a few years down the road, I ended up joining the lab she had been in (but was gone by then).  She was smart and capable in lab but she had some issues that inhibited her ability to perform high-level research independently.  I am not sure exactly what her particular issues were, but when experiments did not work or when unexpected events occurred, she was prone to unhealthy behavior.  These included laying on the bathroom floor wailing and weeping and making statements to various staff about how she could get her knife/scalpel and cut them (she wasn't actually making threats, though they were perceived that way; it was just the way her mind responded to stress).  There were several other incidents, all triggered by the stress of things not working as she wanted them to.

Here's the difficulty.  In Ph.D. level research, a student needs to explore and investigate.  Part of that investigation is going down false avenues, finding out hypotheses are wrong, backtracking, troubleshooting and generally dealing with lots of ""failure.""  A good portion of doctoral-level work involves seeming butting one's head against a wall (this girl actually literally did that; but most grad students only do that figuratively).  If you are not in a healthy place, the stress of all this seemingly fruitless pursuit can be devastating.  It doesn't matter that it's not the student's fault and that it's not fair; it just isn't a healthy fit.

So what happened to this girl?  After the police got involved during one of her more erratic outbursts, her advisor sat her down and discussed career goals.  I'm not privy to the details, but she switched from a Ph.D. track to a Master's track (students in this program were accepted directly from undergrad to Ph.D. and couldn't actually apply for an M.S. though many eventually shifted to an M.S.).  What she had accomplished was mostly enough for a master's thesis.  She struggled through a few more assays with some mentoring and supervision (and a bit of handholding) and was awarded her master's degree.

Here's the happy ending.  So long as things were predictable and ran smoothly, she was fine; it was only when things were wildly out of control that she became... wildly out of control.  She landed a job in a pharmaceutical company overseeing batch testing or quality control or something similar.  And she excelled.  The environment was right for her mental health and the job she did was predictable and routine.  It's been many years, but I know she worked there (happily!) for at least seven years.

So here's the takeaway message:  Not everyone is in the right place for a Ph.D.  That's not an elitist statement or a condemnation or anything.  It's just that to do it successfully, one has to have the right environment, support, health, and personality.  If your issues are preventing you from successfully independently pushing back the frontiers of knowledge, maybe it's time to re-assess your goals.  Take a critical examination of your life, where you want to go and how you can get there.  What do you need to do to be in a place where you are healthy enough for the work of a Ph.D.?  

I have seen students who looked headed for disaster find ways to get to a healthy place.  I want to encourage you, because you can do it.  But I also want you to know that depending on you, you might not be able to do it now.  Reflect, find resources you need, and then progress as works best for you.  Good luck.",6,2017-12-05 15:29:45

dqi89o9,t3_7ga1yh,,Pathological_RJ,,"Apologies for the incoming typos and horrible grammar as I’m on mobile

I would not stress about the 1.5 year gap, from the outside it does not look like as long as it does from your perspective. It seems like you have good undergrad grades, and if you prepare you should be able to do well on your GREs. The biggest gap you may have in your application seem to be the absence of recommendation letters and documented (published) research success.

I’ve seen other commenters recommend pursuing a M.S., which would be decent option if you can find a funded program. Another option is to work as a lab tech for 1-2 years, which would allow you to gain experience while also getting a salary and benefits. I did this for 3 years after undergrad and it was a great experience, I was able to get my name on two papers and take free PhD level classes while working. When I was interviewing for positions I made it clear that I wanted to work for 2-3 years with the goal of going for my PhD, and ended up choosing a lab that let me have independent projects and take classes. 

One major benefit was being able to pick the brains of both PIs and grad students, which helped me strengthen my applications. My PIs gave me great letters and let me do practice interviews, and also read over my application letters. 

One piece of advice that I would give anyone considering a PhD is to make sure and establish support networks, both in your program and outside of school. Research is difficult and can be extremely stressful and isolating. Set up study groups with your cohort, these will be the people that you spend the most time with in your first years in a program. You may end up at opposite ends of campus once you join labs, but it’s useful to have these connections down the road. Having people to vent to, bounce ideas off of, share protocols with can really help.

Even though the class work and research seem to require more hours than are in the day, make time to have a social life, both with your lab / cohort and also outside of the school. This is incredibly important for maintaining mental health and will make you more productive in the long term. 

Best of luck!

dqi6m2x,t1_dqi2oxd,,GenjoKodo,,"This is the right answer.  I dealt with many similar sexual assault issues prior to graduate school as well and graduate school does place unique strains on your mental health.  But you can absolutely do it.  Having a good therapist local to your school will be key.  You will want to line this up before you get there.  

Another thing you said, OP, struck me... That at 1.5 years out you are about as healed as you will get.  Healing from sexual assault can take many years.  Sometimes you have a lot of progress with it, sometimes you may regress too.  But sometimes things plateau and stay the same for a while.  My assault was many, many years ago and I still occasionally have little epiphanies.  I bring this up for two reasons.  First, grad school can be one of those regression-casing things.  95% of grad school is all power plays and making other people feel small -- so how could it not be triggering?  But if you know that going in, you can be prepared.  Second, do not despair that you think you are as healed as you will ever be.  That may or may not be true, but our ability to cope in this new ""normal"" does get better.

I am very sorry that this happened to you and if you choose to go to grad school, you will likely be dealing with a ton of shit that most of your fellow students can't fathom.

dqi2oxd,t1_dqhtbzy,,stelfie,,"I think the more important thing here is setting yourself up for success physically and mentally before doing a PhD program, given the extra challenges you know you’ve had. As a current PhD student, I can say that the toll it takes on your mental health is unique. But I wouldn’t say that means you can’t do it if you really want to. Commuting six hours was not setting yourself up for optimal mental or physical health, so I’m not surprised that that research experience didn’t work out. Which isn’t to say you were wrong for trying it, you were committed and doing the best you could. But if you’re going to do a PhD program, you need to more actively set yourself up for success. Make sure you take the time beforehand to find a good living situation with a reasonable commute and a strong support network, and most importantly **preemptively start seeing a therapist regularly even if you’re feeling fine when you start.** My anxiety issues got substantially worse during my program and not due to any specific event that I could put my finger on, just due to the general stress and self-doubt of doing something like this. It took me too long to seek the help I needed, and I think I would have been more productive if I had gotten into therapy sooner.

I say this not out of cruelty (although I am sure these things are not easy to hear) but because I think it is kinder to encourage you to be realistic about your likelihood of succeeding in academia. From what you have written here, you are a highly motivated and passionate person with many admirable qualities. 

However, again based on the information available here, I think it is unlikely you will be admitted to or graduate from a doctoral program. You were fired from your volunteer research job and will not be able to get a letter of recommendation from that lab. You will need to address that failure, convince another lab that things will end differently there, fulfill that promise to them, and then do the same for an admissions committee that has access to many other competitive applicants. Then, you will need to complete a far more rigorous program than one you have already failed out of (your previous lab) in an environment linked to adverse mental health consequences, something you struggle with.

I do not think graduate school is the right path from you. I encourage you to consider your other options. There are many, and graduate school is not the right path for almost all people. Even those who ""succeed"" often report regretting putting themselves through it.

dq4lj0d,t3_7edzll,,physicsknight,,"Having something else in your life to relax and relieve stress with is really important. It might seem counter-intuitive to add *another* thing to everything you are trying to do, but I would suggest putting it in your schedule and commit to do it regularly. For me exercising and playing guitar both really help me clear my head and relax. It will make going back to work and being efficient so much easier.

Clearing your head when doing those things is most important, I find. Completely separating yourself from your work. For me, physically separating myself can make that mental separation easier too. For example, in my apartment I try to work at my desk, but I eat/watch a show/other entertainment somewhere else. That way, when I want to relax I can go somewhere where I don't feel like I am supposed to work and thus I don't feel guilty about not working. That tends to help me better enjoy that time. If you spend your free time thinking and worrying about work, that time will have been wasted on not relaxing.

Lastly, if things really are overwhelming, see if you can do something about the work load. It's not uncommon for those near the end of their PhD to focus on getting their dissertation done and stepping back from some other responsibilities. Your advisor should (some do and some don't, but they **should**) be open to discuss what is expected of you as you wrap things up.

dpt9xoc,t3_7cvu0s,,DarkwingDoctor,,"I can second the advice from u/anjkris.  Doing a PhD is an exercise in persistence and willpower as much as anything.  A PhD is not something that you do because you need a place to go.  If your heart is not in the work, then your work will suffer.  Then your emotional health will suffer because the work is suffering, which will make the work harder, and so on.  It can end up being a cycle of negativity that you don't want.

If you're really wanting to look into a doctorate, then your plan should start about a couple of years before you expect to be admitted.  That way, you have the time to work on your resume, start some publications, research what doctoral program is right for you, and maximize your mental health before you start the journey.  The couple of years in advance of coursework also allows you time for other opportunities to materialize themselves that may result in you not pursuing a doctorate.  If you're doing good work, you may find more opportunity waiting for you.  

Seriously, though, a doctorate is very tough on a person mentally.  It can make you doubt yourself, your abilities, and who you are as a person.

My department is pretty good about supporting them; if they make the effort the odds are good they will pass. Sometimes things happen in life though, and if they have a legitimate reason for not producing an acceptable product (i.e. illness) we have the option of giving them an incomplete so they can extend the project past graduation and finish without taking the class again. 

The most common reason for not finishing (and having to return to retake the class entirely) is actually when a student simply disappears. That happens maybe once a year on average...they'll miss a deadline (i.e. no draft or something), stop responding to emails from the instructor, and then simply never show up again. Obviously some kind of avoidance issue, usually linked to addiction or mental health issues, but that's the one place I draw the line: if the student won't *try* and can't be bothered to respond to faculty efforts to contact them, I tell my colleagues to urge them to withdraw or assign an F. We've had students come back 2-3 years after that happens to finish in fact. All sorts of things happen in people's lives to get in the way of school.",2,2017-06-13 13:15:33
ditzp1n,t1_ditz6nh,,SnowblindAlbino,t2_7ild5,"&gt; So if somebody flunks their thesis, they don't graduate from college? 

Unless they've completed a second major, no. Generally speaking they will come back for a 9th semester. Not all of our majors require a thesis, but the ones that do tend to be the more rigorous/challenging and all of them require a C or better on the thesis to graduate. There's quite a bit of variation in quality between departments though too...what ""counts"" as good work in one might not even rate a C in another, as the standards are set by each department.

&gt;I doubt most people are suited to or need to write a 60+ page piece of original research.

Most people are are likely not, and most of our graduates (institutionally) don't have a thesis requirement as the largest majors (psych, biol, business) have capstones that are project-based. But I also have the luxury of teaching at a fairly selective liberal arts college, so in general our students are going to be stronger than the general population at State U., and my department has built its major curriculum around research skills so the thesis is really scaffolded over three years. Of the small number who fail annually I'd say 90% do so not because they weren't capable, but because they either fucked up (blew off assignments, didn't put in the hours, didn't take the early stages seriously) or ran into some sort of personal challenge (illness, mental health, family tragedy, etc.) that make it impossible. The rest, they pretty much do product 50+ page pieces of original research and have been doing so since we established the requirement in the 1980s (though honestly the product is far better now than it was even 20 years ago).

As to the need? It's the capstone of our major, the point of knowledge creation and synthesis. I wouldn't want to work in a department that *didn't* have a thesis. I did two myself as an undergrad (double majors) and they were the most rewarding parts of my college education, and prepared me well for grad school. More importantly, our alumni report almost universally similar results-- the theses get them into grad school, get them job offers, teach them skills they need in post-collegiate settings, etc. ",1,2017-06-13 05:51:06
dituyt8,t1_dit9wow,,engelthefallen,t2_6c2hf,"It is not insensitive though to value your time.  I know that is why my advisor will not take me on.  We could make things work, but the comes becomes is that really fair.  He turned down all students for two years as he is stretched thin himself, so to take me on for a PhD while rejecting everyone else kind enters into an area where it has to be asked is it fair to others if I advance.  To his credit, my advisor did lay out exactly what I needed to do to continue to a PhD, and that if I did not meet those goals I would not be able to advance and he would not likely take me on.  What he also did, that you may consider, is he advised me to talk to my other professors.  His view was just because he does not wish to take me on, I should not rule out working with people in my department if my heart was set on staying.  He also offered to write me a letter of recommendation for other programs, including his former advisor.

Something that has not been mentioned, is if the issues with Sarah are mental, it may be in her best interest to cut her off for her own good.  We do not talk about it, but academia has a rate of mental health issues that can lead to negative health effects or suicide.  If she is struggle now with what looks like comps and the thesis, the dissertation prep work is far more stressful and intensive and pushes some well adjusted students to their limits.  Then if she wanted to teach, there is the job hunt that seems even more stressful than getting the PhD.  

Comparing my situation and this one, I think the biggest takeaway is my advisor tries to set parameters from the start, which may be something that may be helpful for you to do.  Lay out early what is expected if students want to continue on, what is expected of students in their coursework, and other projects and make sure it is known what happens if they fail to meet that goal.  It sounds like disability services has done this to some degree, but in general it seems like this is a good practice to do in general to avoid situations like this where you wonder if you are doing enough.

Finally I have no idea what area you work in, but I do education and had to do the class on testing.  A large part of this class was what is an accommodation and what is a modification.  What Sarah seems to want at this point is modifications, or changes to the nature of the program.  Whereas accommodations should put a student on a level playing field by negating many of the aspects of their disability, modifications change the playing field.  Usually modifications change the standards, material to be covered or projects that are required.  The main different on a practical level, is accommodations expect grading and learning outcomes to remain unchanged, and whereas modifications directly change the learning outcomes and standards of learning. Looking at what Sarah is requesting she is requesting that her learning outcomes and mastery standards be adjusted, which leaves the area of accommodations and enters into modifications.  Modifications usually are reserved for extreme cases, like where a student with dyscalculia does not do the same homework as his classmates when they start multiplication.  Their work will remain in addition and subtraction.  Or a student with dyslexia may be excused from doing a book report.  College students however are expected to meet the standards the college sets for all students.  Sometimes the term academic adjustment is used in college settings, but these are modifications that do not changes the standards.  Knowing where the line is between the two, should help ease the worry that you did not do enough to provide reasonable accommodations and possibly explain to Sarah why you cannot alter her grades.  She has the right to request reasonable things to allow her to do her best, but nowhere in the disability rights is there the right to a degree, or admissions to an advanced program if she cannot meet the standards.  The responsibility is on her to figure out what she needs and how to meet the standards.  

Good luck with this.  As for my struggles, they set me back, but in a way, they also helped me a lot.  A got to take time to really spend time working with my area of focus and learn secondary skills to better prepare me for research to attack a complex problem in my field that would lead to a great dissertation down the line.  Also the time I spent recovering allowed a few people to get professorships and grants doing similar research to what I want to work on.  So while I would love to be teaching now with a PhD, the longer road may prove to be the better one as the work I moving into is far more interesting and of greater value to my field.",1,2017-06-13 03:49:59
ditna46,t3_6gt5pk,,historicalline,,"Thanks for keeping us updated! 

I think you did the right thing. You have invested a lot of time in Sarah, and seemed to have been very understanding and accommodating to her needs. 

As someone who has used the mental health resources at my university and gone through a rough personal patch in my graduate studies, I am sympathetic to her issues. I remember you saying she is new to Canada (she is from the States?), which can exasperate mental health issues and work productivity. It seemed like she was making use of her resources, and advocating for herself which is important, especially with the stigma attached to even getting academic help. At the same time, I have been an instructor who has dealt with students who have basically threatened me with complaining when I didn't give them the mark they thought they deserved.

It is disheartening to hear that it seems Sarah is basically throwing a temper tantrum when she didn't get her way. You seemed to have gone above and beyond your role as a Masters advisor (and in an unofficial role, I might add). Yes, we do not know what Sarah is going through. So let's not assume, but I do not agree with some posters here who've said that we shouldn't ""blame"" her for her reactions because her dreams have been dashed. 1) At this point, people have to take responsibility for their actions. She's not a child. I would think she's at least 22. In order to be a successful adult, researcher, and a grad student, Sarah needs to learn to take setbacks and failures with grace and maturity. It is a skill set that needs to be learned, and she doesn't have it (yet). Of course she can cry and yell at home, and even express extreme disappointment in front of you, but then to put the blame outwards and ostensibly threaten you - someone who has seemingly done nothing but try to listen and assist her - is very unprofessional and burns bridges. 2) Her failure should not be surprising, and it was more a fact of willful ignorance since she was struggling in many classes that she believed she could get accepted into a PhD program. That is not on you. ",5,2017-06-13 01:28:27

I certainly was not making any excuses here, nor did I say that my mental health in any way excuses me from my responsibilities.

She has mentioned in passing that she sees multiple doctors, and I know their consultations were taken into consideration when determining her eligibilty for disability services, but I have never spoken to or been involved with that aspect of her life. 

Due to confidentiality agreements, I am not allowed to know who she sees at student health services, or at disability services, unless she herself tells me, and I am honestly not comfortable asking her to disclose that information. While I do agree it would be better if I could consult with her psychiatrist or her disabilities counselor, I am unfortunately unable to do that unless it is at her request. ",5,2017-06-08 16:51:38

This is why she has received some large accomodations through disability services. Those are all the details that I know, and I would not ask. It is not my business, unless she feels to make it my business. She has been seeing them since beginning the program, and she has mentioned in passing that she does see them, but has not divulged anything beyond that.

She could get a medical leave, or receive more extensions if she were to ask. That would be no problem. However, she has not asked or indicated to the department that might be an option she's exploring. 

I would like to clarify that she is in absolutely no danger of being 'booted' from the program. That is not a concern. My department and I are doing absolutely everything to assist her in finishing (double the time for exams, the constant check-ins with disability services and at this point we have extended the deadline for her thesis by a month,) my concern is for next year. 

The degree she is currently enrolled in is terminal, and we are doing our best to help her finish. My issue is regarding her potential application for a PhD. At this point, even if she were to come to me and cite new medication as the reason for her poor performance, I am not sure the university would allow me to admit her. Her current average is at a 51%, literally just barely a pass, and far below the admission standards. 

I will not boot her from anything, but I do not believe I can admit her for a further degree. I have seen no evidence that she has a handle on the material, or can independently conduct research.

I understand that not turning in assignments doesn't mean you're lazy, but you should think long and hard over whether going to grad school is the best choice for you right now (whether or not the grad program lets you in). 

Before you go to grad school, you need to figure out how to get your mental health to a place that you can function effectively in courses. Its *much* better to take a few years off and come back when you think you have the skills and stability to be successful than to build up a record of failure -- remember, if you go to grad school, and struggle and don't finish, and decide later in life to reapply, you'll need to submit those transcripts to wherever you're reapplying. Mind you, this is also true if you take any job in your field. If you take a job and start struggling and missing deadlines, you'll gain a reputation. And frankly, in the professional sphere, nobody really cares about *why* you're not succeeding -- whether it is mental health struggles or not -- they just care that you're not an effective worker. 

You mention this distinction between academic and professional work in your original post, that you never miss professional deadlines, but I'd be very cautious about expecting that this will sustain itself once you leave undergrad. For now, you've been prioritizing professional over academic deadlines but soon enough all deadlines will be professional deadlines. Unless you put in significant work into overcoming the root causes of your procrastination, the same tendencies will creep right back in.

dowukw5,t3_78uhce,,CHEIVIIST,,"There are two main paths in academia and most of the news is around the research oriented academia. The first path is to do high end research at a research oriented university, this is where most of the stress exists. The second path is to focus on teaching and do research on the side at a small liberal arts college (SLAC).

I got my BS in chemistry and went straight into a combined masters/PhD program in physical chemistry which ended up taking me 5 years. I absolutely loved my advisor and the research that I was doing. I graduated at the ripe age of 27 and found a job at a small teaching college where I started teaching full time a month after I defended my dissertation. I have the latitude to develop my classes the way I want and offer them at the times that I want within reason. There isn't an expectation for publications but undergraduate research projects are encouraged. I'm currently in my second year and starting a small research project with 2 students while teaching a full load of classes and I love it!

Not every story about grad school is a negative one but the negative ones tend to make their voices louder (there may also be more of them). Every advisor is different and the trick is to find one who you fit well with. I didn't mesh well with my first advisor and I switched after a year. It set me back a little but my mental health was so much better.

Either route you choose for academia requires a PhD and that can be tough to navigate. All schools should have at least some resources in place to help you out if there are issues though.

Second, if there is something major that is preventing you from progressing as you (or they) wish, then you need to talk about it with them.

I fully understand the difficulties involved in focusing on getting a thesis done, as do institutions in general. This is why, as other people have said, they usually have writing centres and other programmes designed to help students. I personally serve as a thesis mentor (this is a university run, volunteer filled, free service) to provide someone outside of the student's department who is there to provide moral support/general encouragement/someone just to check in with.

However, some of the things you're asking for
&gt; They might suggest other lines of thought, discuss arguments and counter-arguments, and do content editing of the resulting work.

in my opinion overstep the mark. While a student may develop their ideas through discussions with their advisor and colleagues, at the writing up stage *paying* someone to come up with ideas (which is effectively the same as suggesting other lines of thought) feels unethical. Meanwhile content editing, as opposed to proof reading, again feels far too heavy handed to be done by anyone other than a student's advisor who would (should) know where advising ends and taking over begins. I would not trust that to be the case with whoever got hired.

Really, just from what you've written, I suspect that this student is actually getting the appropriate amount of support, but they lack the motivation/will/ability (delete as appropriate) to get through this without having their hand held the entire way. And given that the point of doing a PhD is to become an independent researcher, requiring this level of (paid) support at this stage makes me wonder whether they should be getting a PhD. And I wouldn't be surprised if they expect a lot of hand holding, if they've had someone in their life (talking about you buddy, the person trying to hire someone to drag them through their PhD) doing it frequently.

Unless you've missed things out (health (inc. mental) issues, disability, other extenuating circumstances) then the resources typically provided by advisors, departments, institutions, and just the internet, should be sufficient for them to sort themselves out if they set their mind to it. Which is exactly what they need to do, not just hire someone to make them do it.

dsxlgx0,t1_dsxime1,,HermanTheKid,t2_6t6ri,"I actually think that the question is too broad, although your very good point about correlation of multiple factors is part of how the topic could be narrowed. The comparison of women who wear versus do not wear a hijab is going to be influenced by many other related cultural factors. Also, at least in Saudi Arabia, I'm not sure that you could find women not wearing the hijab, so that's going to be a problem. One way to narrow this would be to look at the mental well-being of girls and young women at the time they start wearing the hijab (I'm not a scholar of Saudi customs, but I assume at age 10 or so just a bit before puberty?) and to do some before/after comparisons. Thus, every girl would be her own before/after comparison. This also obviously has a lot or correlated matters that would need to be addressed, not least of which is that there is a whole host of psychological changes around puberty. However, it may be possible to account for some of these. 

As far as mental health, again I think that this is too broad. Something more specific and age-appropriate might be ""How the transition to wearing the hijab impacts the self-image of pre-pubescent Saudi girls"". Again, even this is rife with confounders, but it not an altogether unassailable question.

To OP: You're better off (at least at the MPH level, perhaps not at the PhD level) selecting an adviser who is better at advising than an adviser who is more knowledgeable in your subject. ",1,2018-01-19 19:06:04
dsxime1,t3_7rjtjq,,TheAxeC,t2_k0j34,"It seems to be a bit too specific, but it could be molded into an interesting research question. If you want to study the effect of hijab on mental health, then you need to be aware of several aspects. 

I don't think I need to explain that this might be a sensitive topic, which does not make it less valid. However, this makes it quite important to remember to be objective. If you make a survey to send to people, you need to be wary that you don't let your own opinion flow into the survey. For example, you could make the survey in such a way that positive effects of the hijab aren't visible. 

Another important aspect is the correlation vs causation issue. Just because two elements are correlated doesn't mean that there is a causal relationship. 

Why do I say it's too specific? Because the hijab doen't exist in isolation. The hijab could be linked to religious reasons, cultural reasons or it could be a habit. Are the effects of the hijab always the same, do they vary depending on the reason for wearing it. Does culture influence the effects.  

As an example, you don't want to end up with the conclusion that ""hijabs have effect x on mental health"" when in actuality it's ""y has effect x on mental health and also causes people to wear hijabs"".

Keeping these items in mind (and checking current literature whether the question hasn't been answered yet), I don't see an issue with the academic merit. However, I don't have any relation with epidemiology, so this is an outside perspective.

dsev9sa,t3_7p5vad,,bosanovanine,t2_oxsks,"Sorry to hear about those difficulties. 

This kind of dysfunction is quite common, both within academia and in other professions too. It can be and in fact usually is very demoralising to work in such an environment and I can understand why you're feeling a bit depressed. 

I am in such an environment myself, albeit with some differences, and would make the following observations, some of which might be helpful - 
1) these things tend to happen in cycles. A dysfunctional department can often turn itself around with the right hire or a few retirements. So what is true there now might not be true in the future. I don't think that having people there for a long time is itself an indicator that there are problems. By far the most difficult people I work with are new hires actually.

2) it is important not only to be insulated but also to insulate yourself. For example you have clearly been told that a prospective hire in the department turned it down because of three of the staff. I'm not sure where you heard that but it would seem very unusual to me that a graduate student would be made aware of that kind of sensitive HR information. Whoever told you that is not acting in your best interests. I'm not saying you've done anything wrong  but I found in my own workplace that I was being fed a lot of gossip by people and while I was glad to hear a lot of that information I ultimately found that it meant that I was part of the problem. I needed to start distancing myself from those people and to stop listening to and repeating toxic information. It doesn't really do anyone any good to know this kind of stuff, and the only reason we like it is because knowledge is a form of currency in a workplace, and thus a form of power. So it might be worth your while putting some distance between yourself and whoever is feeding you this info.  

3) In other words, question the extent to which you yourself might be contributing to any toxicity. In a demoralised department people spread gossip and mistruths, often not even realising they are doing it. Speculation gets turned into established fact simply through repetition, people are scapegoated for broader problems, and you come home feeling bad about things. I don't know what the three people in your department are guilty of, but would say that while I have known academics who were absolutely horrible to work with, I am also aware of situations where good people were undone by character assassination motivated by jealousy. It might be helpful to question whether you have evidence that these people are as bad as is claimed. If so, does that really affect you directly? Maybe it does, but if it doesn't try to ignore it. 

4) Ultimately I think that this kind of work environment is something that probably most academics are going to have to deal with at some stage in their careers, though with varying degrees of severity. I think if you can find a way to protect yourself, and make sure you are not adding to the toxicity, then you are probably developing a good set of skills that will be of use to you as your career develops. 

5) Having said that, some situations are just not retrievable and if you genuinely feel that you are in a place that is exceptionally bad - and if you genuinely feel that your mental health is at risk if you stay there - and if you are sure that you can go somewhere else and thrive there - then certainly do that. 

For me though, albeit that I'm a member of faculty in a dysfunctional place rather than a graduate student, my strategy has been to find a way to live with it, to keep my distance, and to try to make sure I'm making things better rather than worse where possible. That means treating everyone with as much respect as possible, not listening to gossip, seeking evidence for any assertions about people that I do hear, and trying to focus on the positive elements of the job. 

Good luck with it and sorry again that you are having to deal with this. Most people I know have had to face something like this in their careers, but it's a pity that you're dealing with it as a graduate student. ",19,2018-01-09 11:44:05

drts5af,t3_7mf5up,,khosikulu,,"First, I'll agree with others that the ""academia or industry or admin?"" battle can be a false dilemma.  What stimulates each person best may differ, and both challenge and boredom can be found in any of them.  But the level of suitability can vary.  I couldn't do admin (too much conflict) and industry, back when I was still in chem, seemed confining.

So I went on the academic track, and only found out that I had such disorders as you describe the hard way--in my first teaching job.  Thank heavens, they were supportive, and I got my feet under me.  But it took a frightening brush with collapse to do it--perfectionism, distractability, and procrastination do not play well together.  A combination of psychiatry and psychology has been keeping me in the proverbial zone ever since, all the way through tenure.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy was totally transformative on the matter of procrastination--I can't say enough good about it, because it has greatly increased my output while still making sure I don't alienate my family and friends.  In turn, we make a support network of our own.

Regardless of what you do, you'll feel those stresses in some way, so you should address them.  But the sense that you could be doing so much more, or should be, seems pretty universal.  It's not always fair to put on yourself, but you can always talk to a CBT or academic coach to see if you have any habits or in-built reflexes that work against you.  So yes, similar feelings, somewhat similar experiences, and advice that you talk to mental health professionals to figure out your best way forward with a healthy eye on your work.  Don't wait until the tightrope snaps--that, I will urge from painful experience.

drj7opk,t3_7l35r9,,HermanTheKid,,"So I'm not trying to be dismissive, I just want to provide a counterpoint and possible reality-check. I think that one of the large problems with academia is that it has a negative self-image because so many academics (and especially grad students) have not recently been employed outside the academe. Let's look at some of the detractions you laid out:

* Poor work-life balance: This is common in many white collar jobs where people take their work home with them. If you want to leave your job behind you when the whistle blows at 5, you can always pick up a shovel or learn to weld.     
* How PhD students are treated: PhD students are treated a heck of a lot better than most employees working a 9-5. Support services are offered, lots of social events, flexible hours, health plans. Most people would love to have that. Admittedly, that students crave PI approval so much can generate problems, as many employees in other industries really couldn't care less what their boss thinks of them.      
* Petty politics - literally every job. Sick of working the register and want to work the deli counter? Better play some petty politics.     
* The publish or perish mentality: I get that publishing expectations have increased for teaching faculty, but in general ""publish or perish"" among research faculty is simply stating that employees need to be judged using some sort of quantifiable metric. The ""hang sheet-rock or perish"" mentality is just as pervasive. It's just not as idiomatic.       
* Poor pay: relative to what profession? Sure, we make less than most physicians, and probably have a median salary below most attorneys (mean salary won't be helpful in that comparison because of heavy rightward skew in the legal profession), but the job market isn't exactly a secret. Personal choice has to come into play here at some point.        
* Lack of respect from the general populace: I get more respect than most blue collar employees, though admittedly not as much as someone with equivalent years of post-graduate education in medicine or law. I'm not sure I care that much, though if your motivations are more external then your gratification may vary.     
* Dealing with stifling bureaucracy: I've got to give you this one.      
* Whether or not student mental health is treated as a priority: This strikes me as a strange complaint. As far as institutional investment  goes, the mental health of graduate students is probably second only to that of pilots, air traffic controllers, and (arguably) military personnel. Mental health seems like a dire issue in academia at least in part because Type A individuals with high anxiety like you and me self-select academia as a career path. I think it's mostly a selection bias to be honest. The students I've known that had serious mental health needs typically had them met, and almost certainly would have had similar needs had they worked a cubicle job somewhere. 

Which country does it best? Well, if you're a fan of socializing education and career trajectories, then China with its Zhongkao is probably at the top of the heap. If instead you like academic freedom and individual liberty, I'd be hard-pressed not to pick a Western country with a strong economy (e.g. US, UK, Germany). ",103,2017-12-20 19:07:53
drj7eyy,t3_7l35r9,,mycobiont,,"I'm not sure, but I do know that when I studied abroad alongside German molecular biologists, what they said about the dispensations they got for health (physical AND mental!!) made their lives seem way nicer than mine back in the US, where the de facto situation was I'd better be bleeding out to take any real time off, and I have known more than one woman who gave birth and returned to lab the next day. Not necessarily because there was a REQUIREMENT, but there was no support in not falling behind in experiments, etc.

It seemed from what they said that getting to take real time off for physical and mental illness was partially due to German law, to their university's policies, and (perhaps most importantly) to the cultural expectations and responses. They said peers will go out of their way to do each other's work when they're gone with the flu or something, and that there's this safety-connected belief that if you don't feel good for whatever reason, you shouldn't be in the lab. Reduces lab accidents, keeps illness from spreading (if it is something catching), keeps a happier work environment for the people who do come in, and, whether it's mental health or a cold, if you take time off to begin with you'll be back to working better sooner and with less chance of burning out.

I have another friend who is a freelance graphic designer with 10+ years of experience, and he still has trouble landing clients and finding work, and has been unsuccessful in finding a longer term more permanent position. Now, I don't know your geographic location or financial situation, but if you have no experience in the field, no portfolio, no connections in the industry, you might find it very hard to launch into a trainee position or internship like you're thinking you can find right off the bat, just based on what my friends - one starting out, one more established - seem to be going through. But definitely give it some thought and look into it if you're thinking this is what you really want to do! If sticking with the PhD program is unbearable, I'd suggest finding some other type of dayjob while you work on developing your art skills and portfolio. Graduating with your degree could position you to also take on scientific and medical illustration jobs as well, with developing your portfolio, skills, and connections being a useful hobby to keep your morale up.

I'm graduating from a computer science program this June.  Afterwards, I'm taking 16 months off to do some independent research and studying before applying to grad school. 

I'm thinking of completing a post baccalaureate diploma (in cognitive science) in this time (which would require me taking 6-8 courses, spread over two semesters).  The cognitive science department at my school is relatively small and somewhat tight-knit.  I don't think any of the professors would have a problem with me sitting in their lectures (even when i'm no longer a registered student at the school).

Specifically, my area of interest is in AI and machine learning, and the post bacc would be in cognitive science. The research groups I'm interested in working with during grad school are heavily intertwined between the AI/ML/Cognitive Science fields.


From my point of view, I could get the educational benefits for free by just sitting in on the lectures, but at the cost of having nothing to show for it on my CV.  **My question is, from a graduate admissions point of view, how much influence (if any) would having a post bacc be?**

I have a strong GPA and and some research experience from my honours year.  And I hope to polish up my honours thesis and expand on it in the coming months/year and get some publications too.  But the research groups I'm interested in are located at ""top"" schools with competitive grad programs.

&gt;The thing is, I just can't get myself to do any writing exercises. The only time when I'm able to write is if I just have to,

Is your problem. That's just an excuse. Writing is like drawing, math, or playing piano. To get good at it, you need to do it often. If you can only write when you have to, then you'll never get good at it, period. Stop with that ""I can't do it"" attitude and start doing it, even if it's only 5 minutes a day. And if you think that analytic writing do not require creativity, then I got bad news for you... it's evidently different than writing fiction or a novel, but creating sentences and the flow required for a paper is still creative in its own right. 

To be frank, OP, your post seems to be more about finding excuses for your own lack of discipline than any lack of talent or block in and of itself. WITH THAT SAID, I am not you, I do not have your feelings, or your perspective. I know what it is with anxiety and I fully empathize, but it should not lead your life as it seems to be now. If you believe your mental health is inferring with your life enough to cause problems, then my best advise would be to seek a psy or any kind of expert which can councel and advise you on the matter.

I know more than one person who lives in a van. There's next to no campus/subsidized housing available, and new students have a *maximum* of two years in housing. I'm not surprised that there's not much empathy from faculty since in my experience even younger faculty often have no idea about the scale of the changes of the last several years and the particularly gross aspects of America's most expensive cities. But the situation really does seem to be *uniquely* terrible on the West Coast. (I lived in NYC briefly on postdoc wages before moving out here, with a long expensive NJ Transit commute on top of my rent, and I'm *still* under more financial stress as a postdoc in SF.)

Okay, trying to be helpful now. What kind of outside work are you doing? Make sure that this work is actually worth it once you factor in commuting, prep time, and the hourly rate. In my experience doing things like editing or TAing additional classes are not particularly good deals. Also wouldn't recommend e.g. driving for a TNC. However, particularly if you have any name-brand schools on your CV (sad but true -- but use your current affiliation if you don't), with a degree in STEM, you can charge $65-80/hour to teach things like high school math, biology, chemistry, test prep, etc. as a private tutor. You have to hang out your own shingle or use something like WyzAnt to get these rates as opposed to doing it through Kaplan. Just keep in mind that your real ""hours worked"" are going to be around double because of lesson prep. My biggest piece of advice here is not to be humble about your asking price. Tutoring is a weird quasi-Veblen good.

Treating your mental and physical health will pay dividends in terms of helping you get through the next few years. You mention a psychiatrist which is good. Is therapy part of your treatment? I've had the most long-term success with a mixture of methods that included mindfulness meditation and skills (something like ACT) in addition to finding the right psychiatric med for me. Also, you'll feel better about life if you don't borrow from your own health. I was recently out for a week with a nasty virus and the next Monday I felt weirdly great about work -- because I had actually slept enough for the first time in ages! Physical exercise is another thing that seems like a net negative but actually brings a lot of benefits into your life; yoga in particular is a good way to get moving that (at its best) has a focus on exercise as something you are doing as a kind of self-care instead of yet another obligation/thing you must be good at, and there may be discounted classes you can take. I know it sounds counterintuitive to add yet more non-work stuff to your life when you feel overwhelmed already, but when your life is 100% about work and work is not loving you back, adding really fulfilling activities to your life (that aren't just about self-sacrifice but are about doing intentionally doing things you actually enjoy) can make it feel much richer.

Edited to add: I also don't know how you feel about ditching the car but if you can get even $1-2K for it, that could be a very useful starter for an emergency fund. I know Seattle is more car-centric than SF, unfortunately, but my impression is that transit is getting a little better up there and may even actually be better than here. You have to run the numbers, but I use transit, bike, and TNCs to get around here and it works pretty okay, and my expenses would go up significantly if I needed to pay for gas, insurance, etc. I take groceries home via Lyft and have a car share membership if I need to borrow a pickup truck to get a piece of furniture or whatever. It kind of sucks because there isn't a great route I can take on our (unreliable, crappy) transit to work, but it's at least less attention-demanding than driving, and you can listen to a podcast or practice meditation or whatever. And if you bike that counts as exercise! 

Also: shop around for credit cards *now*, before you need them. Credit unions, in particular, tend to be a great source of no-monthly-fee credit cards with very low APRs. If you really do have an emergency and have to use credit, the difference between a 15% and a 5% APR is major.",1,2018-02-19 22:27:48

duhp727,t1_dugx6a4,,khaleesi_onthatbeat,t2_lfjpqys,"I deal with this issue and i’m not even a phd student. I’m paying for my full undergrad out of pocket, no loans or scholarships available to me (im not studying in the us) while working 3 jobs on top of a full course load to cover my tuition costs and living expenses. I literally live off of rice, eggs and kimchi most days and have no social life at all and keeping up with studying and work requires sacrificing sleep and social interaction and mental well-being overall. I share a tiny studio apartment (only one room and a small bathroom- no separate kitchen or living space) with a friend and walk everywhere i can to avoid even public transportation fees. I skip meals regularly, and eat free food at work whenever i can. the only “investment” i’ve made for my health was my gym membership at my school and i wake up at 5am to go there before my day of classes and work officially begins. Every cent i earn goes to paying bills and i’m currently in a deficit too, behind on rent but cant get more hours and its SO stressful. 

Like you though this is also my second time in school and i feel like i am obligated to see it through to the end even if i die as soon as i receive my damn diploma! But things like emergency medical expenses, accident or like my slowly dying laptop are what make it unsettling indeed! 

The system is shit and unfortunately this is what situation we are given and we cant do much to fix it while we’re in it. 

If i were you, I would stick it out for your remaining two years and figure out how to cut your budget down to the bare minimum. If you have a credit card stay on top of any bill payments and stuff first and foremost, so that you have the credit to take a loan out if you need to in the event of an emergency. 

Figure out all the best ways to get access to free food and coffee near your home or lab too! Campus events, food kitchen, faculty lounge that’s always empty....

Hell, our tap water isnt really best for drinking so i carry a backpack full of like 5-6 2Liter bottles and fill them up at the water stations on campus and steal rolls of toilet paper all the time, napkins and sugar packets from cafes...If your school cafeteria is like a buffet kind of style bring containers and take extra food home. Considering how much it costs to go to school taking “advantage” of some things doesnt make me feel guilty at all lol

And eat rice. Its cheap and easy and keeps you full. Collect coupons, always look out for sales. If you live near a wholesale store, get your home products there to stock up for your remaining two years... (toothpase, detergent, soap, etc) and basic staple foods (ie milk and bread for some people) Some local grocery stores discount some of the produce before closing time so do your grocery shopping at night. Also, if i recall correctly, Beans and spam and tuna are usually good cheap sources of protein in the States. 

Complain often and make sure everyone knows how miserable you are. Eventually the system will change, but it wont happen overnight and bringing awareness to the problem is the nest you can do. And also get the stress of it off your chest lol ",3,2018-02-19 14:37:03

Good. If you only have pleasant discussions with like minded individuals you never learn anything. Academics used to be interested in different ideas. Deflecting any and all criticism as sexist/racist/ageist/x-ist is toxic.",1,2018-02-16 20:36:20
du19eea,t3_7wihb6,,biggulpfiction,t2_l8i74,"Unfortunately, abusive PIs like yours are scarily common. I'm deeply sorry you had to go through all of that. My PI is one of the best mentors in the department and still has tendency towards acting in ways you described, and that's hard enough on me as is -- I don't know how people do it. For people who don't know what this can be like, if you've seen the movie Whiplash, when I saw that I was like ""wow this is like grad school.""

That being said, I think people who want to go into academia need to be informed/warned that it is more akin to becoming a professional athlete or artist. You can spend a very long time at it and still not be one of the best. It's not an effort model, it's a talent model. We don't have the same outrage that someone can devote their entire childhood and young adult life to being a baseball player, to get not make the major leagues, and get stuck in the minors, or quit, or have to leave due to an injury. We understand that that is a job that almost no one gets and that you take that risk if you try to get it.

For better or worse, academia just isn't comparable to other more conventional job paths. I'm not saying this as a justification, that it's good that it is this way. But I think people are misinformed going in about the potential outcomes. I also think people misunderstand how much they need to be obsessed with their work to be one of the ones who makes it, and to like it even if they make it in spite of this. (That doesn't mean you ALWAYS have to feel this way, everyone has fluctuations.)

I think what anyone looking into a career should know the following (CAVEAT: I am familiar with the U.S system only):    

* NEVER EVER EVER PAY FOR GRAD SCHOOL. If you have to pay for grad school (with the exception of professional degrees), you're already, ability aside, almost by definition not going to be someone that gets a stable academic job     
* Think about what you would do if not grad school. If the questions you want to research in grad school aren't questions (or similar to questions) that you'd be still wondering about in another career (in job or your free time), it may be hard to drum up the internal motivation necessary to get through grad school.     
* If you aren't sure if grad school is for you, get more experience as a lab manager or research assistant. When these jobs pay, they typically pay better than the grad student stipend, and you will become acquainted with the academic culture in your field.     
* Use extreme discretion when choosing a school/lab/PI. If you get into one school and the PI seems like an abusive asshole, don't go. You're better off reapplying because if you go, things will be infinitely harder than they need to be. 
* Related to above, get as much information as you possibly can from the grad students/lab managers etc while you're on an interview.     
* Many go into grad school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. This is good! It's good to be passionate and excited. But have an exit plan and don't be ashamed of the exit plan. Academia is not for everyone and sometimes you can't know that until you're in it. Be aware that that is a possible outcome.     
* Don't sacrifice mental health. Grad school is a marathon, not a sprint (although it can feel like a sprinting marathon). Take a leave of absence if you need to. Your work will be infinitely better and easier when your own health is taken care of. It's important to prioritize yourself, not just for self-care type reasons, but also because it actually makes you more productive and do better work.     
* Develop generalizable skills (programming, statistics) while you're in your program. Data science is booming, and even if you're sure you want to stay in academia, it is reassuring to know you have options, and it makes you more confident in yourself and your work when you know you have skills that are sought after",2,2018-02-10 14:11:44
dtuyapi,t3_7vsn2x,,doobeedoo3,t2_attan,"&gt;If I get my mental health in check and turn this around over the next year or two, will schools generally look past this kind of thing?

Sure, probably, but the more important question is whether you will be well suited to a grad program given the issues you've been experiencing. Grad school isn't kind. 

The early adult years are a crappy time for mental illness and it's made worse by lack of access to services in one way or another. These things do get better and your situation with your meds should improve, and with time you'll develop a better range of coping skills through good therapy. So the outlook is good, I would say, as someone who's gone through it myself.

However. The most important thing to do is focus on your wellbeing in the here and now. Focus on your wellness and your spirit. It's great that you got a good GRE score. But that thing is good for five years. Give it as long as you need. Grad school can be a toxic environment for those with decent mental health, let alone those with longstanding issues. Think long and hard before you go down this road.

Thanks, I think you're spot-on about the mental health stuff, even down to the specifics of insomnia -- not sure if you meant ""losing sleep"" in a literal sense, but for me it has been the case, over this and other issues in my life/family/relationships. I tried to sidestep those issues to keep my post relevant to academia (and keep it from being even longer), but it seems like that shined through anyway, so I guess that says something. 

Thanks for the encouragement. I am actually currently working overseas (Leave of Absence) and enjoying a break from studies.

dtm3z9q,t1_dtl5sje,,tentkeys,t2_2ppp8j5,"Do NOT bring it up with their department chair.

There are a great deal of interpersonal politics within a university department, and you have no idea where this guy falls in the pecking order (could be tenured, could be pre-tenure, could be an adjunct with no hope of tenure) and no idea what his relationship with the department chair is like. You could be handing his mortal enemy the opportunity to say ""the students have been commenting about...""

Best bet is not to bring it up with anyone. If you feel you absolutely must, then contact your campus counseling center and tell them that you are concerned about the mental health of a professor (don't say who) and ask if they know of any resources that would be available to him that you could pass along. Then write them down on a sheet of paper, say ""Hey, Dr. _____, it's not really my business but I've noticed you seemed kind of down lately, and I wanted to give you this."" and give it to him.

But do NOT, I repeat do NOT go to the department chair, or discuss your suspicions about his mental health with any faculty or gossip about it with other students. That is far more likely to damage his reputation than it is to lead to him getting help. The ONLY time it is appropriate to involve other people in someone's mental health problems without their consent is if they are an immediate threat to themself or others, eg. if he expressed clear intent to commit suicide or murder.

I get that you want to hire the person that's put up with it the longest, but stop telling me that I'll be hired on the next round in the hope that I'll stick it out. On top of it, the community college system around here pays GARBAGE for full-time positions. High school teachers make more, and that's not saying a whole lot. 

I decided to aim for a career in industry and government for: (a) the benefits, (b) the pay, (c) a more predictable work environment, and (d) the greater possibility of upward movement. While I lost some autonomy in the position, I also gained a greater sense of self-worth, and felt that I was reconnecting with the real world. I still teach on the side, but I've severely limited my teaching time. It's helped my mental health, and just made more sense to me. I still get to do research, but don't feel like I'm competing nearly as much.

dt9lc2p,t3_7t0xdt,,AstraGlacialia,t2_ror2i,"In most (though not nearly all) chemistry labs, especially in the US and similar systems, the advisor doesn't take attendance. Typically you have individual and/or group meetings with the advisor every week or every few weeks, where you need to report what you have done in research since the last meeting, but you don't need to report daily. So, on the days when you don't need to teach or take classes and your presence isn't required for some practical reason (e.g., finishing a time-sensitive experiment or supervising an undergrad), you may come (or not come) and go as you please. Or you may need to tell just the people practically depending on you (e.g., the undergrad) but not the advisor. So, there will probably be more opportunities for ""mental health days"" (and time off to see a therapist during business hours) than in a non-academic chemistry job, especially if you can work weekends to make up for it (and don't choose a subfield/topic with experiments which need to be worked on every day). It may be unofficially noticed (and taken against you) if you are missing from the lab for two workdays in a row or if you are missing often, but an occasional day is likely to go unnoticed or tolerated if you do good work/ lots of work overall. Check the attendance policy before joining the lab by contacting the current PhD students.

On the other hand, most PhD advisors are indeed too busy (and unprepared and uninterested) for prolonged discussions about your mental and other personal issues. Supportive, kind and understanding ones can be found, but even then you may need to keep it brief or save such discussions for their rare less busy days. You may be able to talk more about it with your labmates, though it can also easily happen that all the more senior PhD students and postdocs in your lab are international and not fluent enough in English or culturally against personal discussions at work, or that they just don't like it. You may be more likely to get emotional support from the advisor (or a postdoc or another labmate) if you are willing to also give it to them proportionally, as a friend, though such friendships with supervisors can make PhD more emotionally difficult when research isn't going well (I have such a wonderful advisor so my failing experiments make me doubly sad because it means I am also disappointing him).",2,2018-01-26 10:35:15

My supervisors in the past have all been very understanding of my mental health troubles, but they do not take ownership of them. By that, I mean that I can tell them that I'm going to be coming in late tomorrow and that's fine as long as it doesn't clash with my responsibilities, but they don't need or want to know details. As long as I get my work done, it doesn't matter so much where I do it or across what hours.

I know the relief was short lived, but I imagine it felt good to take charge of the situation and advocate for your own needs - that sounds like the path to go towards. 

For the fellowship situation, I don't hear any of your own voice there. I hear that this thing arrived in your life, and you now have guilt about how to handle it: that you *should* use it, that it *should* have gone to someone else, and so on. And fear about it, too: use it? Don't use it? What might happen?

Would it help you to look at the fellowship as a tool? A tool that would help you complete your PhD with less financial worry, and also a boost to your CV? A tool someone gave you based on your achievements? A tool that you are free to discard and not use if it won't help you reach your goal?

In brief: as you know, mental health is a long haul, not a quick fix. You obviously have a strong drive and can work very hard, so your experience might be different, but I want to mention that healing can take a long time. Like, if it takes you an extra semester or year to graduate, that's fine in the long run, if it gets you healthy.

In particular, get healthy *before* you start grad school. Be stable and have a support plan in place for dealing with stress, including lack of drive like you're experiencing now. It's super common to lose motivation mid way through grad school, because your academic problems are bigger, harder, and less clearly defined. 

I love that you want to do math so much. It's great that you have a thing that you want to do (depression's good at hiding that from you). Protect that thing and keep it strong and healthy.

Do fun things, if you can. You've been under so much stress for so long. Go for a walk in the forest. Think about a beautiful proof while you're there. 

It sounds like you're doing all kinds of good things for yourself (including finding support, leaving relationships that aren't healthy, seeking medical help) which tells me you're going to be fine. Not ""it gets better"", but ""if it can get better, this is how it's gonna happen.""

dwvx7fi,t1_dwvvvad,True,NoxiousQuadrumvirate,t2_kywisro,"Well sure, I can tell you my story, but most of what I did was intimately tied to the life I live, who I know, what resources are available.

I was ill my entire life. I had a psychotic break at 16, attempted suicide, was sectioned, practically dropped out of school, lived on the streets, and got addicted to heroin whilst dating a skinhead. 

I got a scholarship to attend university for physics, chemistry, and maths, and I moved 300km away. I tried to get through without any assistance but figured out that was pretty damn stupid after I failed all of my midterms. I got disability accomodations, and managed to salvage my grades. Next semester, I mentioned to a psychiatrist that I was struggling, and he sectioned me. If I refused medication or made any complaints, he'd threaten to have me admitted. Rather than feel like I was at the mercy of his decisions, I stopped all treatment. 

I used ""performance enhancing drugs"", but not anything to do with ADHD, and nothing technically illegal. I also drank coffee, the most widely used cognitive enhancing drug. Those drugs don't make you smarter. They don't make you better at learning. If you don't put the hours in to study yourself, no drug will magically make you know and understand everything. This is real life, not Limitless. I disclosed this drug use to my doctors to avoid any risk of contraindication.

Every semester since then, I've juggled assignments alongside hospital trips and constant hallucinations. If I take medication, I'll be violently ill, unable to stand up without immediately vomiting and fainting. I got a new mental health team, which costs me upwards of $300 every single week. That's 3x my rent per week. They reviewed my case and decided that medication was doing too much harm and I was heading into the risky territory of kidney damage, so all known medications have been discontinued permanently. That's just the price you pay for many anti-psychotics, both typical and atypical. 

My only coping mechanism has been to place my academics above all else. In the years since then, I've had weeks where I was completely disabled and weeks where I was performing at the top of my game. The only way to survive is to know how those periods work and to hyper-engineer my life around it. I keep emergency sedatives on me at all times. My supervisors also have access to these, along with the personal numbers of my treatment team. The only hospital in my state recently lost accreditation for psychiatric care because it was so abysmal, so if I fall ill now, I'm more likely to head to gaol and I'll definitely have to deal with police, who are notorious for abusing the mentally ill. 

There's no great ending here. Sure, I graduated with top honors, the 4.0, the university medal, the academic publications for maths/physics. But it doesn't mean a whole lot. Those achievements don't stop me from being ill, they don't reduce my suffering or my medical bills, and the joy from earning them lasted a grant total of about 10 minutes. My hallucinations have lasted almost 20 years. 

When you fall down, you either get back up and try again, or you get back up and go do something else. Maybe you come back to it and maybe you don't. It doesn't matter either way. You are free to do literally whatever you want, bar physical impossibilities like growing a third arm. So take a break or don't, fail or pass, do maths or do something else, just make a decision for yourself. Get career advice from your professors and health advice from doctors. Be informed and then just decide. Change your mind if you want.",4,2018-04-06 00:42:16

Thank you for all of your concern and advice! 

Advice on role of professors and mental health help: 
It's very late in the semester, and I didn't really understand how to get help from the school until recently. I reached out to the Director of Relationship and Sexual violence and was able to set up accommodations with my professors reducing the need to include personal details of my situation. My professors have been understanding, and I mainly talk to them about accommodations related to coursework. 

Advice on graduation:
I'd like to graduate on time. I think the worst case scenario is if I have to repeat my semester next year. It would just save a lot of tuition money to finish on time. I will set up a meeting with the Dean of Undergraduate Affairs to see what my options are. 

I have an action plan that I'm following. I'm more so looking for advice on the bigger picture I think? Or the thoughts and personal anecdotes of academics on the controversial issues I listed. I guess I’m just feeling lost. I know I’ll graduate and I’ll be successful in the future, but I feel so confused about everything like:
Should I use performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive edge this semester? 
Did you struggle with mental health and what did you personally do?
How did taking a break affect your view on careers in academia? 
What unhealthy coping mechanisms did you develop during your profession? 

It helps a lot to know that this isn’t uncommon. I also get motivation from reading stories that address those issues.

dwvvj07,t1_dwvs6k6,True,NoxiousQuadrumvirate,t2_kywisro,"I remember being in her shoes. I suffer from schizophrenia and it's frankly very overwhelming, but I have to manage it in a way that does not impact my professional life. I can't get rid of it entirely, but I reduce it significantly. My immediate supervisors are aware of the condition and have the necessary contacts, but they don't know more than that. Knowing the specifics of my childhood abuse doesn't help them to help me, and it only muddies the professional relationship. 

That's what it means to have a serious mental illness or psychiatric condition: it's not a card you can play for pity or leniency unless you're willing to pay the price for it. For a lot of mental health issues, you risk losing considerable standing just for admitting to a mental health *diagnosis*, let alone for venting all of your intimate traumas and life story. 

OP needs to know that risk because once you say something, you can never take it back. If you share a very intimate detail about your life and then people act awkwardly or start to see you as fragile and a lesser student, you can't go back in time. 

Once OP actually has this conversation with their mental health team, they'll be told the same thing: discussions about disability need to focus on the accommodations that'll help you. If you're going to talk about being depressed, you need to also talk about what steps you're taking to deal with it (e.g. ""I'm currently seeking ongoing treatment"") and the specific things that'll help you (e.g. ""It'd be very helpful if you could post lecture recordings""). 

Any discussions that deal with the condition in more detail need to be had with a health professional, not your Economics 101 professor. Anyone who is not trained to supply psychotherapy could inadvertently do a lot of harm, and they have the added difficulty that they don't really know OP or their complete medical history. Wanting to air all of their dirty laundry to what may be a professional contact is incredibly foolish, and OP needs to know that they definitely *should not* share those details until they've discussed it with a health professional who actually knows their condition. ",7,2018-04-06 00:15:05
dwvtizc,t3_8a3g2c,True,KeepEatingBeets,t2_41ck9j,"I echo the advice to seek counselling at your school. (Personal things you can do in parallel: lean on your family/close friends; think about what you would love to do for the next six months/one year if you faced no external pressure; make sure that your short term goals are your own and not some random checklist of prestige.) Your advisor, professors, counsellors, and physicians want you to succeed. However, the school probably can't let you magically pass if you miss the requirements by a large margin. This might give the appearance that you have an adversarial relationship with the school, but that would be the wrong conclusion. You'll have to work with them to find a solution sooner or later, so the best thing to do is just go forward and discuss your options with your advisor while simultaneously taking care of your mental and physical health.

I noticed that your posts place heavy emphasis on career steps (e.g. working long hours at a PE shop and earning a return offer). I'll venture a guess that part of your hesitance to consider medical leave stems from fear of potentially derailing a hot career trajectory. If that's the case, let me assure you 100% that taking care of yourself is the stronger play in the short, medium, and long term. Even if this involves doing things like taking time off or graduating a semester later. If you keep putting band-aids on your problems, they will persist and follow you to your new job at Sequoia or grad program at Harvard. If I were in your shoes I'd move items 4, 5, and 7 on your list up the stack and seek every on-campus resource I could find.",6,2018-04-05 23:42:05
dwvr172,t3_8a3g2c,True,restricteddata,t2_8brve,"If you were a student of mine, here's what I would say:

1. This sort of thing happens more often than you might think. You're not a freak and you're not ruining your life. Literally nobody will care if you graduate a semester later than normal. In the long run it will be just a tiny blip in the story of your life. I know this is hard thing to see now, but you'll get past this and it won't be as much drama as it feels like right now.

2. You should spend some time talking to the mental health people who your campus no doubt makes available to you. There need not be any stigma attached to this. In my experience literally _everyone_ in the United States has either had some sort of mental issue themselves at one point (or many points) in their lives, or their close relatives and/or partners have. It's more common than it is uncommon. It is especially common at high-stress places like universities. There are resources available for you. Take advantage of them. Don't try to do this on your own.

3. As for the academic and graduation and etc., you should talk to your Dean of Undergraduate Affairs (or something similarly named). This is part of their job, usually. They have seen this same situation a trillion times already. Probably a dozen times this semester alone! They will know what the answers are. Sometimes it is not a great answer, like ""well, you'll have to retake another semester."" That's not ideal but it honestly is not the end of the world. Sometimes there are better answers, like, ""if you take classes X and Y over the summer, and class Z at a local community college next fall, you can walk this fall but you won't get your degree until next year."" I am just making that example up but things like that have been used here to help students graduate and avoid paying another semester's worth of full tuition. There are also often ways to avoid having a semester full of Fs (e.g. they can convert them to incompletes or withdrawals or whatever). It is unlikely that they can just wave a wand and fix your final semester — but who knows, there may be options. But you need to reach out to them. I would do this AFTER you talk to the mental health professionals, as it is a lower priority than getting some control of your personal situation.

IN SHORT: This is way more common than it probably feels, and there are probably well-established local resources to help you with them. Seek them out. If you're totally at sea, go to your favorite, nicest professor and ask for help in figuring out who you should talk to. He or she can probably direct you to the right people on campus.",21,2018-04-05 23:01:53

Do not ask your professor ""what did I miss"" - ask other students in the class. You can definitely ask questions about reading and show that you are interested in the topic, but I suggest coming with some of your thoughts on the reading to show that you did the reading.

Did you really miss four weeks of class? If you have documentation about the flu, you should give it to him. Even if you have a confirmation of going to a doctor or a prescription for flu medication (?) rather than a doctors note, that is better than nothing. 

&gt; Should I be honest and tell him the real reason why I missed the last two classes?

I would. Explain that you have been dealing with overwhelming mental health problems (you can literally just say ""overwhelming mental health problems"") but, most importantly, that you have been looking into ways to get help with those issues. *This is the key!* If you don't explain that you have been trying to get help then it will be harder for the prof to accept as reasonable, and you will not seem responsible.

I was the same way. I was ranked 2nd in my class and was shooting for valedictorian and Ivy league admissions. My grades plummeted and there was no chance that'd be a realty. My entire identity revolved around my grades and how ""smart"" I was. I had managed to convince myself that I wasn't smart anymore-- that I was worthless. All because of a low gpa.

You are going to need to take the time to process what happened. I do 100% believe that the experience you've had will make you a better doctor. I also know that it will be a more challenging route to success. It might take longer. But assuming that you are otherwise well qualified and motivated, I suspect that it is not out of the question for you to be admitted to a medical school. 

Please don't be hesitate to speak to a mental health professional. What you've been through is very hard to deal with.

“Your initial post seemed to imply that you don't believe (via your friends who are academics) that stable jobs exist at all.”


You’re right, I didn’t. You changed that belief – at least as far as the US goes.

“You've since edited your OP to indicate that you're interested in applied anthropology. That's absolutely a realistic career goal / area in which to work with a PhD in anthropological linguistics. But if that's something you want to do, then you need to be crafting and structuring your experience, knowledge, skills, and network (as well as your research goals) toward that. Applied positions in linguistics are wide-ranging, but what you need in the way of marketable skills to make the jump into a stable, decent-paying job as an applied anthropological linguist will not necessarily be what a PhD program automatically gives you. You'll have to seek out those things.”

Thank you, this is all really good advice.

“As to the rest... your original post seemed starry eyed about the life of a PhD student. Sharing your enthusiasm with students, late night intense talks about theory, etc. These things happen, but the life of a PhD student is predominately research and writing.”

I said nothing about late night intense talks in my OP. Whhat I said was that I wanted to spend time ""in conversation with other enthusiasts"". For what it’s worth, I have spent hours discussing theories with professors and PhD students over wine ;), but that was about 5% of my academic experience so far and it does not define my expectation of doing a PhD. I expect loneliness, I expect sexism, I expect having to fight my corner to get funding, I expect being broke, I expect my work becoming increasingly specialized so that there are fewer and fewer people I can have a deep conversation with about my research, I expect consistently having to work on my mental health (I have pre-existing mental health struggles that I don't intend to let stop me). I expect it to be all those things, but for there to also be moments of connection with other people passionate or curious about your topic, for there to be occasional undergrads who *do* care, for there to be weeks in the field where you feel so full of life you could burst. I expect all that and I want to do it all anyway, because I just want to know more about my research topic and become a better anthropologist. Does that sound more balanced? I was kind of just showing the positive sides in my original comment because I assumed everyone would know about the downsides and take them as a given – that clearly backfired since I gave you the impression I didn’t see any downsides :D

“In an academic job, you may get more of a chance to teach students who actually are interested in your area of research. At times (and if you have a good cohort) you might have a chance to have some fun, intense theory discussions. But you will be busy trying to meet deadlines, dealing with research and coursework, and generally swamped with a variety of often menial-seeming or mundane things.”

You’re describing exactly why it doesn’t appeal to me as a career anymore.

“Having gone through a PhD program where I did have a good cohort, made some great friends, did some fun collaborative work, had a few great talks about theory over beers, and had a few (out of many) interested undergrads in the sections I taught, I can tell you that the things that you look forward to do exist. But they are often lost in the other things that go on as a PhD student. Emotional disarray, frustration with research and advisors and fellow students, relationship woes, financial woes, feelings of inadequacy... these are also things that are characteristic of PhD student experiences-- and in many ways, they can be far more common. I experienced all of these as well during my PhD program.”

I mean honestly this sounds like exactly what I think will happen.

“Bottom line: You need a clear picture of what you'd be getting yourself into.”

I think I do. I just really didn’t make that clear, huh?

“If you don't like hearing about the negative, or think I'm taking a shit on your parade... well, keeping yourself in the dark isn't a good way to go at this. You need to know everything. If all you want to hear is how much fun being in a PhD program is and how much it matches your ideal image of what it is, then you're going to end up very disappointed.” 

I know the negatives. I didn’t like your assumption that I didn’t. I just take the negatives as a given. I feel like we both misinterpreted one another and were talking at cross purposes (because of my poorly worded OP, no doubt about it) and I think from what you said here, we actually have really similar views.

A PhD is long and costly (even if you do it with funding, *which you should be doing*, because PhD students earn so little in the U.S.) and takes a serious toll on your mental health, and if I know a student might want to go and be a speech therapist in the long run, for example, I'd want to know why they weren't just...getting a degree in that.

With that being said, you don't have to mention your career plans in your PhD application letters unless they specifically ask for it, so if they don't, then don't.",36,2018-03-22 23:53:33
dvz621f,t3_85o31b,True,Blufaer1e,t2_grdxp,"Go for it! The application process is lengthy and it is OK to put out feelers. 

Here is my advice: 

1. Really look into different program models and figure out what fits you and your interests best. EdD vs PhD, cohorts based, licensing for superintendency or principalship, etc. 

2. Don't be hesitant about asking about funding. You may need to be tactful about it, sure, but make sure you know financially what a PhD would entail. 

2.5. Don't be hesitant about your goals. Share your goals. See if your goals match the program. Do you want to have publications and a few presentations on your CV by graduation? What about your dissertation topic? How about your career aspirations? Don't go around demanding these things but be sure you and your advisor are on the same page about your professional development. 

3. Find faculty you would want to be your colleagues. Is the department toxic? Are the graduate students publishing and collaborating? Would you want to work there?

4. Have a secret contingency plan in case you need to bail (and don't feel bad for doing so if you need to!) Dropout rates of PhD programs are high because life happens, departments can suck, graduate students suffer mental health issues at very high rates, costs are high, graduate school is isolating, poverty sucks, etc.   For you that might mean making sure your graduate credit hours can apply to your teaching certification renewal. 

5. Have fun! This can be a great experience and could be the beginning of something amazing! :) 

Edit to add: be honest about your research but maybe spin what you do have as a strength rather than a deficit. I have always heard the strength &amp; prestige of your letters of recommendation, writing sample, undergrad/masters university pedigree, and GRE scores are the most important. It always depends on the program though. You will need to figure out what they want and whether or not you want to do that. ",2,2018-03-20 03:04:28

Took me 10 years of off and on part time semesters at community college (for many reasons including mental health issues), with a final full-time push through the last two years at a university, but I got my BS and now I'm in an MS program. I still have mental health issues. I'm not done yet and it's a daily struggle. Sometimes I question why I am here, was this worth it for me, and whether it is worth it to continue. I even had to go into the psych hospital for a week last semester, for reasons related to stress from school in part, and part all my other issues that were exacerbated by school stress. Thankfully I have an advisor and department that are very understanding. But I'm here, I'm over halfway done, and I won't give up.

I would say, overall, if it is something that you want, you should go for it. Consider starting with an MS. Make psych appointments and keep them. Get or stay on some medication and a therapy plan. Don't fall into the trap some grad students do where they're working day and night. Take time for yourself to practice self-care. You might have to drop out and not finish, yes, but isn't that a risk for every grad student?

I submitted my PhD thesis last month and am currently waiting for my viva. So I think it's all doable if you feel like you've discovered something you are passionate about.

IMO, you should go to grad school if you can afford it (money + opportunity costs) and love your field.

d1v70yq,t3_4dtl9j,,HM_D,t2_find4,"Short answer: Agree with psiklops. Basically the job is very flexible and people care about results. Most coworkers will treat your mental illness the same way they treat other important non-work 'distractions,' like cancer or divorce or kids or car accidents: sympathy and a willingness to let things slide in the short term, but no real long-term change in standards or expectations &amp; certainly no relaxation of deadlines. 

Most university jobs come with access to health services, and most universities have a disabilities services office, at least in 'the west.' 

Longer answer: As you move up the ladder, you will basically need to satisfy three groups: the admins at your home university, reviewers of grants/papers/tenure, and your research colleagues. 

The first group makes sure that you're teaching your classes, organizing the things you need to be organizing, etc. In my experience, they're willing to make lots of accommodations if you are sick. At some point,  e.g. if you are totally unavailable for weeks at a time, you would have to go on sick leave - but this point is MUCH later than it tends to be in industry. However, this is also generally the least important group.

The second group is generally anonymous and doesn't care at all about personal factors.

The third group you get to choose. Most people are pretty sympathetic, and you can normally set up your research so that everything is fine if you sometimes can't work. Some people are assholes and won't be accommodating; if you're paying attention, you'll figure this out pretty quickly (I didn't pay attention to this until I was a postdoc, to my detriment). 

Suggestions: try to find out, through the gossip mill, who has a reputation for being a good mentor on these issues &amp; then try to buy them a coffee. This often works better when you're a little older, and it is clear that you've already done at least some scientific work.",4,2016-04-08 17:53:33

I think the rule of thumb is wait about 7 days before a follow up email, but after that feel free to send a second reminder email. ",2,2016-04-08 00:34:32
d1uazb5,t1_d1uajwm,,swordypen,t2_wx8bl,"Thanks for answering! 

Can I ask what you mean by named person of contact? It's not a term I've heard before. My university now won't offer me counselling because I'm technically known to the community mental health team, even though *they* don't offer me counselling either, but I do have a mentor. I didn't know that about the PhD committee thing though, that sounds excellent, way less intense than I was imagining.

I'm sorry about your bad supervisor, that's terrible. I hope that works out okay in the end for you! I just chose my 3rd year supervisor recently, and in person he was really good to talk to, and knows up front about my disability (and was happy to accommodate when I asked if he could do Skype or IM meetings if I was too ill to make it to an office). Sidenote though: I emailed him to follow up on recommended readings (as he told me to do), and he hasn't replied after nearly two weeks. Do I email again, or do I assume he's gathering information?

Re: realising that academia might not be for you, that's... a thing I do worry about, so thank you for being honest. It's a shame because the whole idea of the career fascinates me, but I'm aware that it would be beyond stressful.

d1uajwm,t3_4dtl9j,,FJRabbit,t2_eybn9,"I'm doing a research masters in neuroscience, so only slightly higher up in the academic rankings and still have little experience of postgraduate studies, but I'll answer what I know. 

I have type II bipolar, which on the meds I currently take means I just get depressed for a few days a month and can get quite bad anxiety. The meds also make me quite tired. 

Do you plan on staying in the UK?  (that's where I'm assuming you are from your mention of England). If so, most UK universities are very accepting of disabilities for a start, and you can get a lot of support, from the course or university in general. I for instance have a mental health mentor (who is a bit like a study coach with more of a focus on the health side, but not a counsellor), got counselling sessions with the university, and have a named person of contact who is not my supervisor. The UK is also good for having more than one person in charge of your postgraduate studies: for a PhD for instance you would likely have a committee in charge of your progress through the degree, instead of just your PhD supervisor. 

My supervisor for my research project has turned out to be quite awful, we have virtually no contact and he's previously suggested I was intellectually inferior to my peers after meeting for 5 minutes, and has told me to aim to achieve lower than everyone else due to my health. I complained about it just today, and have had meetings with several people who are varying degrees of appalled by what he said, and people are trying to sort out what to do next. My advice for this kind of situation is two-fold: 1. pick a supervisor for undergraduate project/ postgraduate research project very carefully, try and make sure you'll get on with them, and try to determine whether they're more the involved type, or more detached. I know now I should have gone with someone more involved. 2. Don't be afraid to let people know that you might need additional support, the worst that can happen is that nothing happens. I kept my supervisor's behaviour to myself for a bit too long, now I know I should have reached out sooner. 

One piece of potentially worse news: after 3 months in a lab, I'm coming to see that my dream of working a combined teaching and research position in academia is maybe not for me. Academia is fierce, very competitive and high pressure. Not only am I not good at dealing with such pressure on a daily basis, I think that my health issues make me lack a competitive advantage. I can probably work 40 hours/week (excluding reading etc) tops, and I cannot compete with those that put in 80 hours. I want to do a PhD regardless, and I guess I'll figure out at a later stage whether I'm better off staying in academia or going into industry.

I go in, I do my bit, then I go back to my ""backstage"" life of hating human interaction. The only negative reviews I've ever gotten from students were from students I caught plagiarizing. The most negative feedback I've ever gotten from faculty members observing me was that sometimes I don't clarify points as much as I should for beginners. 

It could be that she's not suited to teaching, or it could be that she is learning the skills needed to turn it on/off. My experience with many senior lecturers has taught me that quite a few of them are actually shy as fuck and also view teaching as a temporary performance. 

I'm in agreement with those who've said you should talk to her honestly about your concerns.

You either need to inform her you can no longer fulfill your duty (which is a perfectly acceptable thing to do), or bite the bullet and stick to the positives. Look at her CV or ask her for a quick interview if you need help. Your university's office that aids with student employment should have resources to help guide you through this process. Above all, don't sabotage a student's career because you're too embarrassed to say, no, to them.

In undergrad I drank on the weekends. Since then it gradually ballooned into full-blown alcoholism. I abused my lack of oversight by not going to work most days. Daily extremely heavy drinking with bouts of prolonged benders where I'd stay inside for days on end and have 750ml of liquor a day or so. It's had a massively negative effect on everything - physical and mental health, relationship, work. Where I'm at now with my research is where I realistically should have been 2 years ago, but it's hard to do tough mental work when you constantly feel like death.

d5a30uv,t1_d59xlnc,,academicta,t2_hcdsx,"It's nice to have a PhD. It's nice for stupid reasons (ego) but it's nice for practical reasons too (jobs). I'm not sure if this counts as a stupid reason or a practical reason, but I think there is also an element of social capital. When people meet you and find out you have a PhD, they automatically assume that you are a smart and reasonable person with good opinions about stuff. 

And having a PhD opens up a lot of doors. Most of the people I went to grad school with aren't in academia, but they have jobs like consulting that the PhD helped them get, despite not being a necessary precondition for the job.

Specific to your situation, I think the problems you described are (1) surmountable in your current position, and (2) not exclusive to grad school. As you recognized, you could go to a different job and be equally uninspired, and you also won't end up with a PhD as a result of slogging through that job.

I see lots of people who post here who are in desperate or unfixable situations -- abusive supervisors, funding crises, mental health catastrophes, etc. -- and when the problem is unsolvable, the person should get out.

Or in orientation, spelling out a strict honor code vs preemptively assuming that the listener will attempt to cheat.  
* Feeling in control of my academic career. Includes having academic responsibilities and rights clearly conveyed, responsive advisors &amp; admin, and a clear appeals process.  
* Clear expectations for grading, conveyed through rubrics, office hours, written feedback, model assignments, or frequent evaluations.  
* Direction and context. Obviously this is mostly internal, but stuff like career advice or course syllabi/paths that explain what employable skills you'll learn helped.  
* Specific supports, like career counselling, advising sessions, time-management workshops, or ombudsperson contact.

What DIDN'T help: therapy, support groups, wellness stuff like meditation sessions or pet-a-puppy times.

I'm from a third world country. It's filled with poverty, stigma, ignorance, crime and corruption. Mental health isn't really discussed over here.

Probably due to this, my university has received low inquiry rate on accommodations and hence doesn't have a system to grant accommodations. This past semester, I had to disclose my ADHD to professors and other people who weren't mental health professionals to get extra time on exams.

I was not granted extra time on my first exam this past semester but was later granted extra time on the other exams.

The person in our ""disability office"" (consists of two people, one is a secretary) was able to be of little help because she was afraid of losing her job or being seen as challenging deans or professors. She did refer me to her boss the dean of students support

But I didn't need to talk to the dean of student support because I spoke to the head of the college counseling office who is more influential and has more expertise.

In a few hours, I'm going to talk to the head of the college counseling office about how I believe I was treated unfairly by my school (it's hard to blame any one particular person because they're really all victims of our third world society), how I might obtain disability documentation and so on.

So far all the head of the college counseling office has told me is to ask the ""head"" of our ""disability office"", which I don't want to do for [these reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4gd4q7/quote_adhd_is_as_normal_as_it_gets_it_is_not_a/).

So I am currently in grad school at a canadian university, and registered with Disability Student Services after being diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety. 

At first I didn't want to tell any of my profs what i was going through due to the same fears as you. I was afraid they would have negative reactions, would feel disappointed, would judge me etc. But then i had a meltdown during the office hours of the prof i was TAing for after one of my students tried to commit suicide and was hospitalized. The prof was great. She comforted me, went to get my supervisor and wencame up with a plan so that i could succeed. I did end up having to take medical leave but everyone in my department has been extremely supportive since they know what was going on. They really had no idea that i was struggling and as soon as they learnt they did everything they could to help me. They teamed up with my doctor and counselor and are helping me get a service dog so that i can start functiioning on a day to day basis again. 

Eventually at some point i collapsed when i was giving a guest lecture for a history class. Intense chest pain, everything went black, diziness, numbness in limbs etc. I felt that i was about to faint. It ended up being a bad panic attack. Since the prof knew i was having some issues she was able to catch me and i didnt hurt my head by falling. It really helped that she knew: she called 911, my supervisor (who came to the hospital) and they did all the paperwork while i was there to grant me a medical leave that would not affect my funding whatsoever. Mental health is very serious and most profs take it seriously. With just a doctor's note in Canada you. An register at DSS/Access service or whatever it is called in your university. I didnt take my health seriously and would work a crazy amount of hours each day without taking care of myself. But thanksfully, my profs forced me to take care of me.

I ended up helping my student register at DSS too and last I heard she got extensions and is doing much better as well. I actually sawbher smile and laugh for the first time, which was priceless. 

So the thing is, it is very likely that your profs will be understanding. A lot of people in academia have either dealt with mental issues or are close to someone who does. If your profs know, they can help you better if you develop a more serious health problem all of a sudden. Mental health is important.

It's close to the truth and there's no reason they should deny it.

dak8mvx,t1_dak4gp0,,atlastata,t2_4jnap,"&gt; You're probably right, but I have already talked to an advisor who is a friend of mine and just told me to grit my teeth and get it done until I get the degree. Probably most advisors/experts will say the same thing. (...) I guess I have to keep going and hopefully I won't destroy my mental health in the process.

I understand this feeling. I'm living it right now. Lets just get through it and wrap up the degree. Survive and advance. One foot in front of the other. Survive and advance. I'm thinking about getting that tattooed on my shoulder. 

I think the advice that you are getting, while well intentioned, is responding to something that isn't the problem. From what you are saying, I believe that the problem is that ""Programming used to be so much fun, now it feels like just an obligation that needs to be done"". Graduate school is actively taking something you loved and making you hate it. I don't think the solution to grit your teeth and just keep doing the same thing. What happens if you come out of grad school hating programming? That's your career!

I can't guarantee that the mental health services on campus will help (they exist and they're probably free). There are good counselors and bad counselors just like there are good programmers and bad programmers. I can assure you that no halfway decent trained mental health professional would ever tell you to grit your teeth and get it done. Doing the same thing and hoping for different results is literally insanity. They'll listen, they'll think, they'll put your feelings into words, they'll discuss strategies and, yeah, they'll make you think about whether this is the right fit for you *right now*. It might not be. 

My situation is different from yours - different degrees, different life paths, different everything. But I came out of a shitty situation to go to grad school and grad school didn't magically fix anything. There's a chance you'll come out of grad school and get a first job and your mental health will still be an issue - jobs aren't magic buttons. The grass might be green on the other side, but the easiest way to guarantee that is by watering it - otherwise, you're waving a rain stick and praying for rain.

I would strongly suggest finding healthy ways to improve your mental health, whether it be talking to somebody or working out or yoga or taking breaks during studying or even trying something else for a minute.

Grad school is not at all generalist, by which I mean, there's no gen ed requirements or anything.  You focus 100% on a single topic.  If you don't know you want that, you're probably not the best candidate for a grad program.

It's totally normal to take a year or two between undergrad and grad.  Try getting a low-level job or internship or even volunteering in each field to find out if you really enjoy it.",2,2016-11-26 22:43:33

That said, whether or not you can work in academia (or work anywhere, or work at all) depends on your own individual mental health. I would agree that only being able to work 3-4 hours a day is a serious concern (i.e. it is unrealistic to expect to build an academic career while only working 3-4 hours a day). I'm not sure what you mean or expect in terms of support for people with mental issues. At least in the US, there is certainly institutional antidiscrimination support, and in general I find that people are more educated and aware of mental health and how it affects us, but typically the day-to-day care tends to be transferred to professionals like psychiatrists and so on, and the individuals themselves (as it should be, imho). From my observations, people work with their doctor to find a cocktail of meds/therapy that works for them, and there isn't much that their colleagues can do except wait for them to get better.

We got into different programs at the same school, but while she was eager before, now the only thing she says keeps her going is the idea of going back home. She says she's been lying to herself and is terrible at school (she always does better than me). She says constantly feels like the dumb one in class (all her classmates have said they're jealous of her work). The rest of her cohort all knew each other in undergrad, so she feels like an isolated outsider here. She can't bring herself to care about her work because with all the stress, she just feels like it's a giant waste of time. But she also says she'd never forgive herself if she dropped out. And I don't mean all this in a ""haha I'm the worst~ nevermind my perfect scores i'm terrible"" way, but a ""sobbing on the bathroom floor every night for a week, self harm risk"" kind of way.

First of all, get rid of the idea that there's any shame in dropping out of grad school. Grad school is a job, and jobs don't work out all the time. And grad school is definitely not a one-size-fits-all kind of job. Three of my closest friends dropped out of undergrad, and they're all incredibly happy and comfortable with what they're doing now, and that's the important part. Grad school's riddled with accessibility barriers that are never worth sacrificing your health to get over. My partner's case is a little unique, since we're overseas and dropping out would force her back home, but if that weren't the case, I'd recommend her drop out for the sake of her health. But it's not because you're not smart enough, I guarantee you, and your work ethic is something for you to decide, not compare to other people. For me, I work best when I don't pay attention to how other people are doing. You don't need that stress.

Since dripping out's not an option for my partner, what we do is focus on giving it her all, as much as her mental health can take. Don't get caught up in anxiety about the big picture--set short term goals and hit them one at a time. Find a pattern. Get outside and into the sun. Make friends. If you come out of your program without the highest marks, so what? It's a glove that doesn't fit perfectly. Not your fault, you did what you could, which I guarantee you is better than you're thinking. Nothing is more important than your health and happiness. It's easy to think school is the end-all-be-all of life, but saying that not doing well in grad school means you're a failure of a person is like saying not getting into a ritzy party in Manhattan means you're a social outcast.

&gt;I still do it on occasion

This might end up being a bigger problem with your future PI than scars from your past. They will be more concerned about where you are now. The relationship between a PI and a grad school is a bit like a marriage, a bit like being a parent, and a bit like a traditional manager-employee relationship. A good PI will be invested in your success, emotionally as well as professionally. 

My advice would be to hide the issue for the length of your rotations. If you reveal the problem to one PI, they might privately mention it to their colleagues. After all, if they barely know you, they will feel a greater sense of loyalty towards the other PI's they have known for years. For faculty who haven't gotten tenure yet, each grad student is critical to their future. Whether they get tenure or not will depend significantly on the achievements of the handful of students they advise. This relationship works both ways. While you are sure that working 12 hours a day solving a gnarly research problem is the best thing for your mental health, your PI will need to be confident that you being part of their lab would be a net positive. Grad students crash and burn frequently. Years of hard work a PI put in amount to very little. Some grad students kill themselves. The emotional fallout can devastate the entire lab. One my friends in grad school killed herself. Another ran away abruptly and cut off contact with everyone. 

Reveal the issue once you have found the lab you like and have proven yourself. Your PI needs to know you can handle stressful situations and produce good research. Once that is no longer in question, you are home free. You don't want to end up being the person everyone treats with kid gloves. A lot of grad students have difficult pasts and end up being a stronger person for it. 

Good luck! I hope you find a lab you like. ",3,2016-08-22 03:52:55
d6r1ebo,t1_d6q5va6,,throwaway-sh-phd,t2_10qvvo,"Thank you so much for your thoughtful and thorough response! This was exactly the type of response I was hoping for, and it's much appreciated. 

I'd been wearing short sleeves with visible scars for most of my undergrad (long sleeves when any cuts were new, but short sleeves otherwise). If a peer who should know better asks, the answer is ""rabid squirrel attack. They may look cute, but they're vicious little fuckers."" That's usually enough to change the subject while indicating that I don't want to go into it. Very few people do ask though. If a peer asks with genuine concern, I'm usually willing to discuss it with them, with varying degrees of personal info depending on how well I know them. If an adult unfamiliar with self harm or someone who grew up in a different environment where it's not as common asks, I usually just opt for ""long story,"" and leave it at that. It's not that I couldn't discuss it, but if they don't realize what they're asking it would be uncomfortable to explain. 

I would be able to discuss it with a prof, if it comes up. I have in the past during undergrad. It's not my favorite thing to do, but I'm fine with it. 

The answer to the second one is more complicated. I've dealt with the issues that caused me to attempt suicide. Self harm isn't intrinsically bad though, and I still do it on occasion. Some people go for a run to clear their mind and get endorphins. I cut. It's not the best option, but I'm more focused on working on my underlying issues than actually trying to quit. If I try to quit cutting, I'm more likely to turn to other, more dangerous, maladaptive coping mechanisms. So I still do it, a lot less frequently than I used to, and in places that aren't visible. If it comes up, I'll let them know that I'm in therapy and on medication. 

As for the other part, I'm too emotionally sensitive. But I'm emotionally sensitive about anything and everything, whether it's a high-stress environment or not. I think that overall academia is what's best for my mental health (ironic, right?), because it gives me a community of people who are weird like I am, and it keeps me busy solving puzzles. My mental health was best when I was spending 12+ hours a day in lab one summer of my undergrad, and doing so because I was so excited about my project. I get stressed about deadlines and expectations, but boredom and free time are also terrible for my mental health in their own way. 

In my interactions, very few people would know that I was sensitive. I tend to appear fairly confident and self-assured. There are moments where insecurity can sneak through my walls, but I've gotten better at controlling it over the years, depending on context. Like when I TAed, my students always saw me as confident and competent, even when I was struggling with my own mental health at the time, and I'm pretty much the poster child for impostor syndrome.

d6qjdmw,t3_4yrtyk,,jenesaisquoi,t2_3xi0l,"I don't know what R1 school means but I'm at MIT and I'm guessing that is one? Anyway, I also have mental health issues, and the best thing that I did for myself in this PhD program was picking a professor whose students were happy, rather than one with the top projects. He's been really understanding when I've had to take it slow because of mental health. I'm also very open about my issues because I believe in destigmatizing it by being like ""Yeah, my brain doesn't work right. And I'm still here, being awesome enough"" 

So keeping in mind that my advisor and lab all know my shit, which isn't normal probably, here's my two cents.

If you have any say in the choice of lab, I would keep your arms covered. That way when you get to pick which of the pis you liked, you can ask them instead of having all the PIs know.

However, if it's assignned/up to the PIs, I wouldn't cover them. You want an advisor who recognizes the worth of your work. Also, as an advisor, I'd be more reassured by someone who is open and in treatment than someone who is hiding and could possibly have a meltdown with no support. 

You may also want to ask your department admin if they are nice what you should do.

Good luck!",3,2016-08-21 13:07:56
d6qct5q,t3_4yrtyk,,cletus-cubed,t2_4rmkr,"PI here, so I'll drop my 2 cents in. First, let me assure you that R1 vs. R3 has nothing to do with it. All PhDs are rigorous and all have the same trials and tribulations. Some students will breeze through in an R1 and that same person may have problems in an R2 because it's not so much about the individual program, it's about jumping through the hoops, proving you have the chops for research, and who you match up with. 

In terms of finding a lab, everyone wants a student who works hard, is reasonably intelligent, and will be an asset in the lab not a pain in the ass for the next five years. A lot of the bad habits that annoy your PI will likely be chalked up to naivete and they will assume you'll grow out of them. One piece of advice given to me is to look for anything that annoys me, multiply it by 10, and if I could live with it then the student is fine. Right now my rotation student is an ""interruptor"", presumably because she wants to demonstrate how much she knows. That's something I can deal with, I'm pretty sure the post-doc already mentioned it to her. 

In regards to your specific problem... keep in mind that everything you think you know about how a student should be treated can now be thrown out the window. No one wants to see a student treated badly of course, but you are looking for a relationship like none other, your mentor wields a lot of power and you have very little. They can get by with a lot. I've seen all sorts of bad behavior get swept under the rug, and even if it's not, the student always comes out with the worse, even if they are in the right. 

So from my perspective, you should keep any mental health issue to yourself until it gets to be an issue. There's no reason why the PI shouldn't accommodate this, but don't give them any reason to reject you before they commit. If I felt my student might not be mentally stable all the time it would definitely affect my decision. I would also suggest you keep it to yourself in dealing with other students. New PhD students can be very gossipy. You want your PI to base the decision on your abilities, and not some perceived or mis-perceived notion. 

At some point you will obviously have to show folks your arms, there's no way to go 4+ years without them seeing it sometime. But get in a lab first. Also, be prepared for awkward questions. Scientists can sometimes be very socially incompetent and they may ask something inappropriate, you may want to have a practiced response.

d6q15kz,t1_d6pzew5,,throwaway-sh-phd,t2_10qvvo,"Thanks! I appreciate the perspective. Your reasoning is exactly why I wore long sleeves in my interviews :)

The difference here is that the potential PIs get 6 weeks of me doing a rotation in their lab before they make a decision. I was wondering if the scars would be enough to be likely to sway that decision, compared to the 6 weeks of work. I know that, all else being equal, almost anyone would pick the student without the scars. I just wasn't sure how much it was likely to affect a decision.

As for addressing them, most people usually know what they are. There's not much to address. I might try to gauge from current lab members how understanding a PI is about mental health issues if I'm considering that lab. If a PI brings it up, I'll answer any questions and address their concerns (within reason), but I worry that bringing it up would make it seem like I'm trying to force my PI to care about my personal life, if that makes sense.

If it were me I'd cover the scars - because I know if I personally saw someone with scars like that, I would think less of them and be worried about their continuing mental health. I can imagine that some professors would feel the same way, so if you were to be purely objective about it, if there's even a *chance* that a potential supervisor would react negatively to your scars, *and* you can cover them up, then there's no benefit from showing them (aside from giving a potential PI a 'heads-up').

Having said that, it's something you *may* need to discuss after rotations as people are going to see them at some point, and it would be a good idea to address this with your PI so it's not an elephant in the room.

d60z6vk,t3_4vk8di,,cnm03d,t2_sd2jz,"Having been in a similar situation, however it appears not as aggressive as yours, I can only really give my perspective on how I handled my situation. Funny thing though, mine just didn't tell me I needed therapy, they actually called the Dean of Students telling them that I needed a mental health intervention. Fast forward some time, I left, and my PI ended up losing their job.

I left my program and found a new advisor in a different state who like you mentioned, told me I wasn't a terrible scientist and that I had good skills and experience to provide. Having been now 5-6 years away from this situation I can reflect back on how I handled the entire thing and what I wish I would have done, and what i've learned from it.

The very first thing is that if a grad student is having some issues with their advisor their first step should always be the graduate coordinator (it's probably written in your graduate manual to do this). Similarly, I let things get way out of hand before I went to mine, but that person is the faculty member in your department that is there for you and will help get to the bottom of the problem. Have you gone to your graduate coordinator or department head to discuss your difficulties with your PI? Have you told them that you're withdrawing? One should really work within the confines of the system if you are having a disagreement with a coworker (or boss). One of the big things I learned with dealing with conflict is to be hierarchical in my complaints and to be as fair as possible to my supervisor/coworker, even if they don't deserve it. This is about saving my reputation as a professional employee. If you report this to someone high up in the university without allowing your department to handle this, you'll be pissing off everyone. I always now tell the person that I have a problem with that there is a problem and this is how i'd like to see it corrected. If it's not corrected than we will have to bring in a third party. This makes it so there is no surprise to anyone and I don't have to answer to anyone of ""why didn't you let them know you had an issue?"" 

It's probably at this stage not worth discussing with your PI that you have problems, when I brought it up with mine it was way to late and that's when they called the Dean of Students on me. You probably should go straight to your graduate coordinator. If you are getting text messages that are threatening and abusive from your PI then you should go and show your grad coordinator and/or department head those texts. Most departments want you to have an exit interview before you actually leave, whether it's graduation or when you withdraw. They want to reflect upon your experiences. You need to be prepared that you may need to talk about this with them, and you should, and they are not going to be able to do anything when you are walking out the door. If your PI is truly being abusive and pretty much harassing you, your department will support you if you give them the chance.

Leaving is fantastic. Things will get better and you will be a better academic because of this. But tread lightly if you're going to complain and if you're going to complain, give the department head and graduate coordinator a chance to intervene before you go above their heads. I get it, I get why you wouldn't want to because it appears that all the faculty are friends, but there's a boundary of professional conduct that they will not allow to be crossed (and they might not be as good friends as they look). I really, really urge you to go them first and bring proof- again, the texts are perfect because that crosses a big line.

Good luck and I saw you responded to someone else about not having letters from your PI. My first one was terrible and we have no relationship so I have no letter from them. My second PI was amazing and wonderful but he passed away. I have no reference letters from a formal supervisor. People are understanding that situations happen.

Deceptive is one thing, but a PI doesn't have the right to abuse or yell at a mediocre student, an unproductive student, or a student with mental health issues. What does it matter if he/she was unproductive? PIs need to act like the adults that they are and handle their relationship with their mentees in a mature, professional way.

2) let's say there is known deterrence effect. We still must compare that to other forms of deterrence, such as life incarceration. Does the death penalty deter more than life in prison? 

3) let's say there is known deterrence effect, we still must contend with the additional costs of imposing the death penalty versus incarceration. 

4) let's say there is known deterrence effect. We still must contend with the systemic causes that lead to those murders like poverty, drug abuse and mental health. 

5) there is a great difficulty in establishing causality. Econometricians are only able to use natural experiments to statistically disentangle deterrence effects from other changes. Some show a significant effect, some don't depending on the econometric model and data looked at.

On the other side, deterrence is not the sole reason for criminal sanctions. We also use sanctions for distributing justice (subjectively defined of course), incapacitation, and even base reasons of proportionality of crime and punishment.

&gt;Then I hid behind a wall so none of my classmates would see me, **cried and had a panic attack for about 1.5 hours, and seriously considered committing suicide.**

&gt;I wasted her time, I blew it, I take full responsibility for my actions, and I'll accept any consequences without question. She may have been kind in her email, but that doesn't mean she won't chew me out in person. I don't expect her to continue being my advisor, and I expect my reputation at this uni to be irreparably ruined. I may have to withdraw from school and leave academia altogether because the shame is too much to bear. I don't know how I can show up at her office next week, say sorry again, and ask for forgiveness even though I don't deserve it.

&gt;I don't want to tell her about my mental health issues because I know there's no (public) crying in academia and I'm a 20-year-old adult who needs to suck it up like everyone else. It would be disrespectful of me to burden others – especially those ranked significantly above me – with my own problems. A year ago, the professor for whom I work managed to figure out that I'm mentally ill without my explicit disclosure, and I'm ashamed of myself every time I see him, so I don't want anyone else to know. I'm also ashamed of myself for not being able to handle a little sleep deprivation.

&gt;Last academic year, I **never got more than seven hours of sleep a night**, **hardly ever engaged in ""self-care"" beyond basic life maintenance, and had panic attacks once a month**, but I still have a 3.8 cumulative and 4.0 major GPA with one co-authored conference paper and another on the way.

&gt;I'm an **undergraduate junior**

Jesus fucking Christ tell me you're trolling. You HAVE to take care of yourself whether or not you'll have to pay for a therapist. You can't be successful (nobody will give a rat's ass about your GPA if you can't be healthy and deal socially with people) if you're not healthy.

You're an undergraduate JUNIOR on top of it. And you're panicking for a 20-minute chat you missed with an academic advisor?

It's not as though it was a one hour appointment or a serious meeting. You don't do much in 20 minutes. Plus, this person is a human being, not a king or some sort of all-powerful master who has the power to put the final stamp on your degree.

Do you want to stay in academia? Then get your shit together by dealing with **LESS** workload and **SLEEP FUCKING MORE** (take camomile, I can even give you some names of really strong ones), and **SEE A THERAPIST**.

I'm using bold and capital letters so hopefully it gets through your head. Contemplating suicide because you missed a 20-minute appointment means there's obviously something wrong (that alone and the fact that your panic attacks last over an hour). You're letting yourself dominated by pressure for what reason? What are you goals exactly? No matter what they are, if they're reasonable you sure as hell don't need to have such a life.

I bet there is a Reddit, Facebook group, blog, student organization or *something* for minority and first generation students that you could join. The situation you are in really is a difficult one - so don't beat yourself up! Anyone in your shoes would be having a hard time. But remember, it's not really your coursework you're struggling with, it's these other social, economic, and emotional issues you have going on. 

I'm white, but I come from a low socioeconomic status with lots of mental illness in my family, so I know the feeling of ""needing to do 10x better than everyone else just to catch up"". I even dropped out of high school and started college late, then spent longer than most people do in undergrad. I went through a phase where I was acting like you, blowing everything out of proportion, thinking if I wasn't perfect I would never ""get ahead"". Turns out that was false. I stopped being such a perfectionist (in order to save my mental health) and now I'm in a good (although not top ten) graduate school for biology.

I'll probably always feel ""different"" from my colleagues and that's fine too. I wish you the best of luck.

One semester was really rough on me- I had to drop down to the bare minimum number of classes, stop research entirely, and still was struggling to keep up with my schoolwork.

dfk47iu,t3_625bf1,,the_Stick,t2_lwcwk,"I am going to answer honestly.  I would want to know *everything* about your mental health.  I would want to ensure that you were receiving sufficient care and therapy and were sufficiently self-aware to manage your health and your interaction with others.

Part of the reason I would want to know is so that I could be supportive and maybe tailor assignments and deadlines more appropriately.  I would want to help and advise, though I couldn't (and wouldn't) take the place of your health care providers.

Why would I want to know so much?  Let me tell you about my Ph.D. lab; I was somehow known as the *normal* one which is pretty much the only time that adjective has been applied to me.  We had one graduate student who threatened to get a knife and stab an employee; fortunately, her issues were well-known to most (though not that employee) and given the right environment and support, she was a very solid scientist.  That was an extreme example that had some serious consequences and ultimately helped her (and her community) allow her to become successful.  Though I have lost track of her now, for at least a decade after that she only had less severe outbursts, finished her degree, got an industry job and accolades and raises.

Contrast that with a post-doc who snapped and threatened to get a gun and come in and shoot everybody.  That was the only time I ever saw my advisor rattled.  This guy had bounced between several labs but after this he was *gone,* and gone fast, including being deported.  As an advisor, I would want to know with certainty that the stresses you would face would not drive you to violence.

Now that latter example is extreme and from your questions it seems very unlikely that your mental health would lead to outwardly-directed violence.  It also seems that you are aware of your own health and care.    I would still want to know.  I think that disclosure, when joining the lab (not rotations) would help establish a mature working relationship and build trust.  Good luck!",13,2017-03-29 14:01:19

I understand the frustration with taking subjects you think you already took in school, but the truth is, they will go into more detail at every step of the way. In undergrad they will go deeper than in school, in postgrad they will go deeper than in undergrad. Since not everyone had the exact same schooling as you there is a need to go over basics in every freshman year to make sure everyone has understood (or at least been taught) those before being able to dig deeper.

If you have been out of school for a bit, you may want to dip your toes into a community college first.  All degrees (from accounting to zoology) have common course requirements (things like take 2 histories, 2 sciences, 2 writing, etc.).

Less obligatory note: yes, everybody feels anxious from time to time. What makes it a *disorder* for me is that my body will basically go into ""fight or flight"" mode when it doesn't need to.

The single biggest thing (other than recognizing I had a problem in the first place) is regular exercise. Exercising for about 30 minutes each evening worked well for me. I didn't need special equipment, just did body weight exercises (sit ups, push ups, etc.). Now I bike commute about 20 minutes each way. It was too cold for that for the past few months, and I *didn't* exercise in the evening like I had been doing...and I definitely felt my anxiety rise.

This brings me to the next biggest thing: recognizing what my anxiety feels like. Once I was aware of how specifically my anxiety affects me, I was able to handle it better in the moment. It's a pretty powerful thing to be able to tell yourself ""this is just my anxiety talking, this isn't an actual problem"" and so on. It doesn't make the anxiety go away, but it helps me *manage* it.

Don't reduce workload beyond that without recommendation from the professional.

I am in a place with a large number of international students and postdocs (and a few professors) to whom such help is not (cannot be) available, so more of handling each others from such aspects is on ourselves (and almost everyone has some struggles at least sometimes). So unlike most others here I will try to say how you may be able to help yourself - every student regardless of the student's mental (un)health, but may be especially important for students with such difficulties.

Every student is different, so you'll do the best if you ask the student themselves how you can make it easier and better for them. (Of course, only follow reasonable suggestions which don't take too much of your time and energy.) If the student doesn't give useful suggestions, you can also ask other lab members who may know the student better.

But generally... From this question and comments, you care about the student as a person, not only results-producing machine - that's great, and make sure the student knows that (but be careful to not show it in a way which can in the student's culture be interpreted as sexual/romantic interest). And that the student knows that you consider them very talented - and exactly why. Assign the student a reasonable load of concrete tasks which are useful for not-distant, easily foreseeable future (but not overwhelming), so that the student feels useful and valuable - that may include what you mentioned (""mundane tasks, reviewing literature, attending seminars""). Give suggestions how to start (or how to proceed when stuck), break tasks into smaller if needed (but not so much that it becomes micromanagement burdensome to you and/or to the student). Explain to the student why this topic is interesting and useful to others, why ""the work is important to the department and the lab itself"", and why it will be important for the student's desired career too. Give exact and reasonable deadlines when possible. Give deserved praise. Give honest feedback in nice, respectful way. Do reprimand the student when needed, but do it without others around and in calm voice, with clear reasons and suggestions for improvement, making it clear it's criticism of that behavior and not of them as a whole student/person.

Most importantly, if it doesn't help, don't blame yourself. You can't save everyone. There's lots of reasons beyond your control. When my nice advisor worries about me too much or/and blames himself for my poor progress/motivation, that just makes me feel worse.

dexstj2,t3_5zcizz,,emailanimal,t2_mkohp,"What /u/FG10 says is only part of the deal. It is a start. Anyone with a mental health issue needs to get treatment first and foremost, and if they are not getting it, the first thing to do is refer them there.

Having said that, if this is your Ph.D. or MS student, things unfortunately do not stop there.  I've had multiple experiences, both somewhat successful and somewhat unsuccessful.  

First and foremost, rule number 1 is student's health over just about anything else.  

Second, figure out, if anything related to their work with you is a cause of concern. Sometimes it is, because there are deadlines, stress, etc.  If this is the case, remove as much stress as you can.  Sometimes it is the other way around: the work the student is doing is actually what helps them. This needs to be understood.

Third, figure out what the plan is. Does the student feel able to continue work? Does the student need to take time off? Does the student need a change of topic/change of approach to work?  Figure it out and adjust accordingly.\

The bad news is that sometimes the right thing to do is for the student to stop working on the project and drop out of school to deal with their health. Sometimes the student needs to start working on something else.  Sometimes they are very close to completion when this happens, and it is really painful to see good work go away.

It is not your job to go out of your way and make unsolicited changes to the student's academic load in the hopes of making things easier for him or her.

That said, there are at least two scenarios in which your intervention may be warranted.  First, if the student's mental health problems are clearly affecting their work, you likely need to step in and discuss the problem with the student.  In this case, it might be a good idea to let the chair of the department/director of training know that the issue exists, especially if the problem stands to affect the rest of the lab or the entire department, though ideally the student should contact that individual directly, given the very personal nature of the problem.  Intervention options in this case could include things like a reduced workload or even a leave of absence, with the support of the department.

The second scenario in which your intervention might be justified is when the student specifically asks for your help.  In that case, you'll have to use your own judgment to determine whether the student's requests can or should be accommodated or whether there is anything else you can do to help.  It's okay to empower your student to ask for what they need, and it's your job to determine if what they're asking for is something you can reasonably grant within your scope as an advisor.  If in doubt about a specific request, ask a colleague in the department.  ",9,2017-03-14 18:25:44

We work with students (both UG and Grad) at a time when they're going through transition, and at a developmental time when symptoms of several mental health issues are most likely to emerge. 

To your specific questions, agree with FG10, about getting them connected with the counseling centre 1&gt; I have talked both UG and Grad students through the process (both in person and on the phone during a crisis) of getting to the campus student wellness centres. At some (and more every day) universities, they have skilled staff ready to deal with these kinds of issues. It has helped in both cases. One thing I've found in the cases I've referred is that they're scared that the uni will contact their parents because that's happened previously (when they were minors). 2&gt;I definitely Academic activities were useless to this person because their cognitive skills weren't functioning. It sounds like your student has been getting help, so may be functioning better than a student in crisis. 3&gt;Yes, I know several students who have switched labs because it was a ""bad match"" between either supervisor or topic and it turned out fine. If this student is reporting that they think it's a contributing factor, then it's worth changing to see. Will likely add some time to completion, but in the times I've seen it, they did graduate. 

One final thing I'll suggest is becoming familiar not only with the counseling centre folks and the best pathways for you to get students connected (walk over versus phone call, for example), but also become familiar with the policies at your institution. At my institution, we frequently will grant requests for leave if students are suffering mental illness with diminished capacity. It can work against them though in that then they're more isolated from their peers and colleagues so knowing the policy, but also having a frank conversation about their choices on the administrative end of things can be helpful.

If a student tells me they have an illness (mental or otherwise), I give them any information they may lack about our professional resources on campus.  I've worked closely with our counselors, therapists, and others in student health.  They know that if a student needs accommodation for any reason, they need only to reach out to me.

devv98r,t1_devktij,,coldseaweedsalad,t2_x20kz,"I was going to say almost the exact same thing. I don't think ""Am I worthy"" of going to grad school is really a particularly relevant question; there is a whole host of different people who do and don't get into various programs and schools based on a wide variety of merits. If you can get you, you're ""worthy"" and then all you have to do is actually finish.

So, beyond getting into grad school, you have to think about finishing grad school, and whether or not the lifestyle of being a grad student is something you want to take on, and whether or not it's compatible with where you are in your life at the moment. There are plenty of people with chronic illnesses, mental and physical, that are able to be successful academics. But if you feel like you are currently more in a ""constant crisis"" phase and not so much in a ""management and maintenance"" phase, adding the grind of grad school may not be the healthiest choice for you *right now*. That doesn't mean it never will.

(There is also the slight chance that grad school will be better for some people; for me having a lot of flexibility and independence compared to a day job has made it a lot easier to manage my health conditions, because I have more options on days when I am feeling like garbage).

You should also take into consideration what your health conditions would be like if your health insurance were to change. If you become a grad student, you might have different coverage than what you currently have, and that might impact who you can see and what kind of treatments are covered (this is assuming you're in the US).

If you are currently seeing a psychologist (which it sounds like you should consider if you aren't already), they might be a good person to talk this through with. You could mention that one of your goals is to go to grad school, and that getting yourself to a place where that is possible is something you want to target in therapy. Since your psychologist is someone who has also had to go through grad school, they might have good insight on how to help you.

But I would get away from the idea of being ""worthy"" of grad school. I don't think that there is really anyone who is unworthy, it's just a matter of what specific steps any given person will have to take and what it will demand from you.

deihzli,t1_deihgwo,,DannyDoesDenver,t2_13arwf,"&gt; Your post seems based on a lot of assumptions

Yep. I acknowledge that in the 4 sentences that compose the post. I'm looking to identify and reduce my assumptions with additional data.

&gt; Define ""successful"" as it relates here. Are you referring to finishing a degree program? Getting funding? Getting a position in academia?

I've worked in start-ups with professors as C-level members. Most of them sucked but were successful in academia. For instance, one CTO created a major research center at a state university (not Ivy league by any stretch but still impressive). That CTO had severe issues with narcissism.

Another start-up CEO I worked with had autism but was a physics genius.

Another CEO I worked with was a self taught genius who made his money playing the stock market and used those funds to create an interesting start-up. This guy was the most neuro-typical.

All of these fit under the computer science and electrical engineering fields.

&gt; I work 50-70 hours a week, I cook and eat healthily, and I exercise. I don't avoid other people, although being in a new city and not knowing anyone makes meeting people harder.

I never said people like you don't exist. I'm looking for how common your situation is. In my experience, there are more neurotic people sac'ing their health for immediate returns than those dedicated to long term development. More importantly, I see people screwing over their health and GETTING AHEAD in tech. That's why I wanted to know how common/important this is.

&gt; What people are disputing is your totally baseless assertion that these things are an actual factor in success.

Why attack the question instead of saying just that? ""I see no correlation between poor mental health and academic success."" **That's what I wanted to see honestly. A lot of people saying, ""I've not experienced that.""**

As a side note, I have in other responses and will again say that this was poorly framed. I'd been drinking when I posted so I let biases enter the question framing that have distracted you and several others. That said, is this AskAcademia or SubmitAPaperForAcademiaToReview?

deenl0j,t3_5x0ab6,,_whatevs_,t2_h9vom,"Here's some rationale, for the sake of context and perspective. 

This happens way more frequently than you may initially suspect, but it's usually kept under wraps. For several reasons: it makes the supervisors look incompetent, forces everyone go through a hellish amount of bureaucracy to explain exactly what happened to justify the funds already spend, and try to keep the ones that haven't, all the while trying to minimize the impact this will have on future funding request. Also, if you are the only student funded to do that work, chances are the whole project is dead, and the years that went into preparing it and getting funds for it are wasted. Which seriously sucks.

Then there's the student, who following the supervisors example, also tends to keep it quiet in fear of being judged, and with the power balance skewed against him/her, is also afraid of how this will look on the CV.

This is always a big mess, and a lose-lose situation in the short term. But the supervisors tend to insist because:

1. pdh student drama is very frequently a part of the phd process, and if all phd's were interrupted at the first sign of distress, you'd have an extremely high dropout rate (I'd guess at least 50%); 
2. the supervisors may have ulterior motives, but it's also their job to help and motivate students
3. they also have ulterior motives
4. they stand to lose less if they convince the student to continue, even if they do a lousy job. though one could argue that the same is true for the student, were it not for health/mental health reasons. 

The student is in the tough spot of having to decide if he/she is truly at the limit, and risks losing health-wise versus what he/she stands to gain professionally if he/she continues. Which is a heart-wrenching decision to make. But once it is decided, there's no looking back, and his/her best option is to quit as cleanly and quickly as possible. Emphasis on cleanly. 

Bottom line, this is tougher on you, but it's also tough on everyone else, so you should handle the process with the respect everyone deserves. Make your case clear to everyone involved, and I trust in the end, if they're not complete jerks, they will be understanding.

d9ofpnk,t3_5bgumk,,Neemii,t2_5c9uv,"Have you ever met someone who struggled through getting their GED after dropping out of high school and then was accepted to university?

About what it felt like to face down the stigma of being a high school dropout and putting yourself out there anyways? Do you really think the GED is easier than attending high school?

I know someone who is 30. They were kicked out of their high school because they were being picked on by a ton of students for being gay and the administration didn't want to deal with it. Their mother was dealing with a lot of health issues at that time, so instead of finding a new school they started working full time. They've struggled, living paycheck to paycheck since then, spending some time living with their mother, before finally just last year getting into a program that will help them complete their GED in hopes of eventually furthering their education so they can get a job that will make them more than minimum wage.

Most people who drop out of high school don't do it because they are ""lazy"" or because it's ""easier"" to quit - they often do it because of circumstances beyond their control, because of coming from low income families that need the extra money from them having a job as soon as possible, because of dealing with discrimination, because of physical and/or mental health issues, because they aren't receiving the support they need to do well or feel engaged in their education. 

Here are some stats about why people drop out:

&gt; * High school graduates earn, on average, about $1,600 a month more than those with a GED (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012).
* Less than 5% of those with a GED receive a bachelor’s degree, compared to the 33% of those with diplomas that do (U.S. Census Bureau)

In taking a step back, also ask yourself if you would have any regrets switching to a program closer to home. Academia can be extremely stressful and if your passion is disappearing to the extent that you are engaging in self-harm, don't beat yourself up over it. Going back home could very well be the best thing you can do for yourself - remember that what you're going through is part of a much larger learning experience and you have to protect your mental health to get ahead. Leaving home is difficult, and while it can be an extremely valuable experience pushing through it, it's not for everyone, and maybe the time just isn't right.

If after this contemplation you feel that you want to leave not because you are giving up (something you would regret later) but because it's the best decision for you, do it. Life is too short to be miserable.

Whatever you decide, it is always best to keep your options open, so look into taking a leave of absence, or deferring your program for a year.

*3) Closely related to #2: get more face time with others, especially more senior people. Ask questions, show that you are engaged, curious, knowledgeable. Their recommendation is often THE most important part of your application to the next position. Talk to others at conferences and to those visiting to give seminars. Forming a network of academic friends and colleagues makes a world of difference. If people on a hiring committee already know you and like you, you will almost always be chosen over someone with a couple extra papers.

*4) More than just work hard, prioritize your time. When you are at the lab/office, get stuff done and don't procrastinate. But be sure to have time set aside, explicitly to not work. This will help make you more efficient when you are working and maintain your mental health. Getting that TT position is not worth a mental breakdown or 10 years off your life.

As someone with an anxiety disorder, one of my best relationships with a prof came about because he was supportive of my anxiety, but also respectful of my abilities. He knew when to push me and challenge me, and knew when to give me space (if anything, he pushed me harder than other students because he knew I could do it). In my experience, profs don't want you to avoid special accommodations when you need them, they want you to communicate about them in advance.

Do that for a few behaviors.

I do not think it's necessarily good to be emotionally invested in your academic research. It can be a barrier for a lot of students, for a lot of reasons, and classes structured around personal experiences *massively* privilege students with good mental health, ""normal"" or ""ideal"" backgrounds, and students who are financially privileged and have more self esteem because of that privilege. It's a pedagogical quirk that teaches to the ideally positioned student rather than the real student who ends up in the class. Obviously, there are also arguments for this kind of teaching, but it's also quite frankly just trendy right now to have a student-centered and emotional-narrative driven classroom activity. 

I find the activities a huge barrier to comfort, and therefore learning, in the classroom, especially if they're public. Private written assignments aren't as bad, but it's so problematic to be assessed on the quality - the subjective quality - of your ability to write an emotional narrative for a grade. 

I have done many of these classes. I've gone to experimental colleges and had teachers in standard university programs, both undergrad and MA level, and the classes have always been a struggle for me emotionally and my grades suffer. I've looked into these practices as part of a teaching and pedagogical year-long course I've taken as well as from the position of an educator, and I think that while some students benefit, others are harmed, and these coursework assignments need to be flexible. Talk to your prof about writing a more analytic paper if you feel the same way. Also, feel free to PM me if you want some sources or anecdotes about the whole thing.",4,2016-10-19 08:34:34

I am applying to PhD programs soon and I would like to become a professor, so I need this professor's letter of recommendation more than any other because I work for him. I do not want him to think that I am not qualified for graduate school because of health. I am fully aware of the stress and sacrifice that comes with grad school, I grew up pretty poor so I will be okay in terms of isolation, not affording food etc.

I am also not asking for accommodations (I don't need them), less work, or even for him to treat me differently.

d8j0plj,t1_d8j0b6p,,manova,t2_35w8d,"First, you have to assume you even get to work with the person.  I had a former student get into a PhD program working with a nobel prize winner.  She had no access to him.  She worked in a lab with 50+ other people and her mentor was a senior grad student.  It was all just so you could say you were in the lab.  She left for another lab within a year.

I had another former student go to a big deal's lab.  I warned her about the lab.  In 20 years, that prof had graduated one PhD student and there was currently a grad student in her 8th year in the lab.  My former student quit the program after a year because of the prof.

I had another former student go to a top named school, but got paired with a relatively new prof.  He would not let her leave the lab.  He would not let her attend classes and gave her a cot to sleep on in the lab.  Finally, after she almost flunked out at the end of her first year, she went to the Chair and things got fixed (she was moved and he was banned from having new grad students).

OP is talking about his mental health problems.  In my experience, students don't just drop that unless it is a real issue.  That is not something to take lightly in considering a PhD program and the potential of not finishing. 

It does you no good to work for a hard-ass if it means you will not graduate. 

**Edit:**  I went and looked up my best guess of what programs OP is talking about.  As I suspected, Berkeley appears to have a couple of people doing solar within a larger sustainability program while ASU has a couple of dozen faculty doing solar energy research.  Plus, if OP wants to go to industry, that seems to be what ASU produces (all of their notable alumni were industry people).  If OP wants to go into academics, this may not be the right program.

d8j0b6p,t1_d8izdkg,,ordash,t2_bqgyz,"&gt; I want to to give a bit of an opposite opinion. Your major professor makes or breaks your PhD experience. You mentioned you are prone to mental health issues. Working for an asshole PI making you work 80 weeks is not good for you. It does not matter if he won a nobel prize if you wash out of the program after having a break down. The benefits of having a good boss should not be over looked.

I really don't know where this mindset comes from. If people are the best in their field, they are the best. It is completely irrelevant if they have a cuddly character or not. Most of the best, most brillant people have not, many are hardasses who make you work like a donkey. But guess what? That can be a good thing. As long as you don't have to mow their lawn or walk their dog in the middle of the night, as long as it is relevant scientific work they ""torture"" you with, it's fine. That's how you learn.

d8j02qv,t1_d8iyyef,,ordash,t2_bqgyz,"&gt;I completely understand OP's uncertainty and self-doubt. And I think it's important to recognise that grad school can be stressful, lonely, and quite difficult mentally/emotionally. And this is for a lot of students, not just people with a track record of poor mental health.

Of course but this is called life. Being professional (as well as growing up for that matter) means being able to get out your comfort zone especially when it comes to decisions like that. If you have the opportunity to go to a school that is MUCH more prestigious, it should be a no-brainer to go there, even if this may be stressful at first (which it will, that is the whole point: The point is to challenge yourself to get better, otherwise you won't learn and you won't grow). Yes you may be lonely at first when going to a new environment and it may even be difficult mentally/emotionally but this is true for every human being on this planet who arrives there new so you have plenty of people who are in the exact same boat as you. On the other hand: It may even be the most liberating and fantastic experience of your life.

Always staying in your comfort zone breeds lazyness and mediocrity which you should avoid like the plague if you want to get anywhere in academia or any other attractive or lucrative job. Staying in a much worse school just because it is in walking distance to your childhood home is a bad, bad, bad decision. There are no two ways about it. 

Considering all that OP was saying he made the wrong decision and should get his behind to berkely as soon as possible. ",-2,2016-10-08 07:55:52

The benefits of having a good boss should not be over looked. 

What is your ultimate goal after PhD.  If you want to go into industry, I would argue the professor with major industry experience is the better option than one at a flashy school.  Most professors are academics who will give you solid career advice on being an academic, but know very little about industry (because that is not the life path they went down).  Working with a former industry big-wig could have its own benefits. 

Granted, I know nothing about solar research, but something that stuck out to me was your comments about the relative size of the programs which you said ASU has a big program and Berkeley not so much.  Which school has a better reputation in the field?  I have known of many situations where a big deal school hires a few people to say they are in an area and then ride the school's reputation while some state flagship has built an excellent program with many faculty and top quality facilities to match.  

Transferring during a PhD program should not be done lightly.  You are not an undergrad that just decides to show up at a different school next year.  It is probable that none of your classes will transfer and you will be set back a significant amount of time.  Plus, you have to think if the prof at Berkeley will even take you back after turning him down (and if he does take you back, then you are either a truly awesome applicant [good for you] or he does not get many quality applicants [red flag]).  

If you really want to transition to another school, I would wait to do it at a break point, ie after completing your masters.  No one should ever question someone shifting after a masters when you got it at the same place you did your undergrad.  It will also give you enough time to see if ASU is a good fit for your career goals.  Also remember that there are post-docs.  If you don't feel that ASU is giving you enough splash on your CV, do a post-doc at Berkeley or MIT or something. ",13,2016-10-08 07:16:14

Opening up about mental health is tricky, but I'd understand and likely respect you more if I could communicate with you about what's going on. Professors are familiar with students falling short of expectations, for a variety of reasons: lose interest, too much stress, give up, chronic excuses, etc. It can be natural for them to assume that you are a typical student in that regard, unless you communicate otherwise. 

Like another suggestion here, I'd reach out to your counseling services to get guidance on how best to approach it - you may be surprised that they have resources you weren't expecting. Their job is to support you, and going to them first may protect you no matter how it goes down with your professor. As the professor, if you were confiding in me your mental illness - and only as much as you're willing to share - then I believe FERPA / HIPAA would mandate that I couldn't share that information, as that is your private health information: http://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/hipaaferpajointguide.pdf

Even though it's probably illegal, they might also discuss it with others without my consent and there's nothing I can do about it. Therefore, I don't ever plan to tell the PI exactly what's going on beyond ""health issue"" so that he doesn't just think I'm lazy and fires me.

Many don't realize how common these disorders are in the population. For example, 1.2% of people in the US have schizophrenia. That's more than 1 in 100. Most of these people have their first psychotic break in their late teens-early 20s, basically college age. So if you teach a class with 100+ students every semester, eventually you will have a student who is in the midst of a psychotic break. 

Our population is increasingly medicated, and this is especially prominent in college students. Many have been on ADD medications for many years, then they move out of town, away from family and friends, to a drinking rich environment. They are vulnerable, and often can't get a psychiatrist in town very easily. They often go off their meds, either because they can't get in to see a psychiatrist, or because they want to try a different approach (i.e. mom and dad aren't demanding it). This can throw them into a very bad state.

I think it's important for us to remember that not every student who cares is going to be proactive about asking for help, and that it's the most vulnerable students - the ones with weaker support networks at the school, and the ones dealing with mental health issues - who are most likely to fall into a cycle of missing work or class, feel too ashamed about it to ask for help, and end up falling further behind.

de9bbd2,t3_5wc480,,emailanimal,t2_mkohp,"Meh. Applications are relatively cheap, even for a poor student - or at least the application fee investment is well worth the flexibility you get.

Typical principles are:

1. Quality of the program. Figure out what your floor and ceiling are expected to be. You want one-two safety options (places that will take you no matter what), and one-two stretch options (places where your chances are small).  You want other applications to fall in between so that you had a good chance of being admitted.

2. Geography. You are going to spend five best years of your life (quite possibly, they *were* best years for me) at that place. Make sure you actually like it. If you cannot stand humidity, don't head out to the East Coast.  If you hate driving, go for schools in big cities. If you want to be close to the family, draw a radius around the family hometown. If you want to surf, apply to UCSB. And so on.  Do not underestimate the importance of actually liking the place you are at, and having things to do off-campus during your copious spare time (because mental health depends on it for many people).

3. Program curriculum. I've been at places where getting a Ph.D. is a really straightforward affair: take X courses, find an advisor, defend proposal, write thesis, defend.  I have also been (not as a student though) at places where the Ph.D. curriculum is structured to punish the student: course, two breadth exams and a depth exam, which take semesters to prepare and which require a retake if you did not pass them from the first try, only then proposal and defense.  Run AWAY from places like this. Poorly structured program will add years to your stay without giving you tangible benefits.

4. Faculty. If you want to work with a specific person on a specific topic, apply there. Plain and simple.  Be sure to have a plan B once you are there. In my case I had three people in mind as potential advisors: one of them wound up retiring almost as I came, the other one was an awesome person but would've made a horrible advisor for me, but one of the three became my eventual advisor and I am very happy about it.

Now, what actually happened to me was this: I was eslewhere and I asked a friend who was in college to go to a Ph.D.  bulletin board, get the tear outs for whatever schools were advertising, fill them out on my behalf and request application packets... This was, of course, before the World Wide Web (or just as the world wide web was emerging, but before it became used as the medium for submission of paperwork).

de6t3wm,t3_5vxkmt,,mamakemake,t2_er0su,"I have a psych degree and those who say there's basically nothing you can do with one are simply wrong. 
It can be a risky degree if you're just cruising through college as the opportunities only are given to the proactive and persistent.   You can minimize the risk by studying/being involved in psychology AND something else. I chose to learn Spanish, did an internship at a mental health clinic,  and I obtained a minor in applied math. All have been great complements to the degree and have opened up many doors. A psych degree is what you make it. It is the experiences that you attain in undergrad that will give you opportunities, not the degree itself.  

You probably won't make bank with an undergraduate degree but there are many master's programs that can significantly increase your salary. You can make a decent living with a psych degree, the path just isn't as clear as it is for other majors. 

It has helped me in nearly every domain in my personal life and I use what I've learned every day. 
I have noticed that it seems to have given me the advantages above many of my peers in the domains of interpersonal skills, communications, writing, teamwork/leadership, and personal development/happiness. 

Also a huge bonus is that you'll be surrounded by beautiful and sociable women in every single psych class. Classes at my university were generally 75% female and 25% male but it was not uncommon for me to be one of the three guys in a 45 person class.

Many internships are very competitive. 7 C's is not ""several"". 3 C's is several. So, if you have 7 C's and 2 I's that is like two semesters of mediocre work and two classes you didn't finish. If you go to work for someone, they are going to wonder if you will also do mediocre work there, and perhaps not finish. Meanwhile, students with a 4.0 are your competition.

But yes, getting to do this is still a privilege, and one that I've absolutely earned from the years of hard work I've put into it. I won't deny it - it's one of the best, most meaningful jobs in the world, but don't deny that it hasn't got a horrible side.

dcu670f,t3_5pun86,,lepermadonna,,"Can I tell you my story? I was in a very toxic lab where my PI's wife (who was the lab manager) ruled with an iron fist and a horrible personality. She felt she needed to sabotage most PhD students, and in general, men. (She had a chip on her shoulder about how hard it is for women in science. The irony was that originally she was a Master's student for my PI, they became lovers, the guy divorced his wife, and married the lady in question... so her hard work happened mostly outside the laboratory. Anyhow.) So she sabotaged us. One student for example was essentially funded by another prof: all his reagents were purchased by a postdoc in the other guy's lab, as our dear lab manager did not order you stuff, unless you have shown success. But without stuff you can't really show success, can you; not to mention as a PhD student you are being trained -in theory- how to be a successful researcher, so a couple of hiccups are kind of expected.

 There were three postdocs who took up similar horrible attitudes- as they themselves were suffering. Grownup women behaving like the cast of Mean Girls; you can imagine how great it was to go in every morning to work. Needless to say there were nobody graduating from the lab for seven years; everyone either left, or just got stuck. It was an incredibly toxic place.


After sticking out three years in that lab, I just gave up and left. The best choice I've ever made. Should have done earlier. I was depressed, suicidal and utterly without hope. Once I left I finally felt this weight I was not even aware of lifting off my chest.

cqyq4xa,t1_cqymm24,,phdme,t2_n9bgu,"If you decide you're really serious about it, you might consider what I did as a much cheaper alternative to getting an MA before the PhD. I had some major mental health challenges getting through undergrad and by the time I pushed through to finish it I was working full time and just took night classes from a diploma mill type school to get it over with. As I matured and recovered, my intellectual curiosity re-awoke and I realized that I wanted to pursue a PhD, in a humanities field that I had almost no credits in for undergrad since I got a generic business degree. 

So I decided to get another BA from a ""real"" state school (the first one was real, just not all that rigorous). The advantage of doing it this way is that you can get the degree in 2-4 semesters (probably 2-3 in your field, two regular and a summer), it's usually much cheaper than an MA, you have the chance to bring up your overall GPA (and many programs only look at your most recent 60 hours, which can be a huge boost if you do well), and it gives you the opportunity of developing new relationships for those all-important recommendation letters. If you do an MA and go on to a PhD at another school, you're likely to have to do all the classes over again anyway. 

Most importantly you can point to measurable accomplishments in your field in the form of classes taken, and hopefully end up with a kick-ass writing sample from one of those classes. (This last item is really key, a great statement of purpose and writing sample along with the commitment I showed by going back for the extra degree and research got me into a top ten PhD program despite my *very* checkered academic past). You also will have the chance to explore the field a little more than in an MA, since it sounds like you still need to figure out where your interests are.

The big disadvantage of doing it this way, as I have learned the hard way, is that an MA is likely to prepare you *much, much* better to enter the PhD program at a level equal to or ahead of your peers. On whole, the lower cost means that I probably still made the right decision for me personally, since my debt load is about half what it would have been, but I am constantly aware that most of my classmates came in much better prepared. 

Anyway, my point is not that you *should* do this, just to make you aware of what might be a lower-stakes option that has worked out for at least one person.",1,2015-05-05 03:09:24

This has been my experience since I started college. When I started college, I even reached out for help concerning my mental illnesses. I knew I had ADHD and mental health issues, but I could not get a diagnosis until I was 25. Then, I had to drop out of school because my mother and grandmother both got cancer and died in the same year.

No, you do not need to minor in anything.  Minor tends to just mean, 'I had enough of an interest in something to pursue it somewhat'
For example I studied anthro and minored in Bio because I thought it was cool.  Because I took the minor and not the major, I was exempt from taking calculus and O chem and whatever else came with hard science (I consider this to be a bit of a downfall, but besides the point).  It really has no bearing on my career path or my ability to produce research.  I thought Bio was cool and complimented my major, so I went for it.  
Double majors are a bit more lucrative, on the other hand.  My sister got a double major in finance and philosophy, because good luck getting a job with a philosophy degree.  That would open up a lot more doors.

But in your case, with no real desire to minor in anything, and in the interest of your mental and financial health, it just doesn't seem to make much sense.  Graduate on time and get outta there.  ",2,2015-04-28 01:08:04

There are ideas that have scientific consensus, there are theories that are supported beyond reasonable scientific doubt, and there are facts that have been clearly demonstrated with data. But at the forefront of science are people trying to do something new: explore ideas that have not been explored (let alone have the community come to consensus on), provide new interpretations and support for theories which may compete to explain the same underlying data or reflect different approaches to the problem under investigation, and gather new data, measuring new variables under new conditions with modern techniques, etc.

No one scientist speaks on behalf of science, so yeah - two psychologists may say different things about psychological development. They may both have support for their ideas and both may have something valuable and true to add to the field. Psychological development in particular is extremely complex and relies on many different factors. One researcher saying ""adult mental health is impacted by early maternal care"" and a second saying ""adult mental health is impacted by genetic factors"" are both right. One does not preclude the other. The two researchers probably agree with each other too, they're just focussed on different aspects of the problem and need to break it down into more manageable research approaches.

I think that it depends on if you think you (at this moment, without further studying) have a good handle on the material. If so, is there an alternative way to demonstrate your knowledge? For example, it helped me to have the option to take the exam earlier, in a quiet room, with the professor or someone else proctoring.

Tell them why you want a PhD, in terms of what your life goals are (want to be a professor, work R&amp;D in industry, etc.).  What have you been doing already to put you on this path.  You should not be indecisive, even if you are still figuring things out.  Your letter should reflect laser focus on a life goal.

What about this program will help you meet these goals?  What professor do you plan to work with?  Mention this up top, my old grad advisor was the program director and he organized the review of applications.  He said he read the first paragraph to see which professor the application for was and then forwarded it to the appropriate professor.  He said if he could not tell who it was for, he would just leave it in a stack and bring the stack to the meeting and ask if anyone wanted to look through the stack for other potential students.  Of course, by that point, each professor often had their choices picked out from the applications that they had already reviewed.  I don't know if others do something similar, but I see nothing wrong with starting your letter with something like I am applying for the PhD program in XXX and hope specialize in YYY working in the laboratories of either Dr. ZZZ or AAA.  

There will probably be other aspects of the program that you will want to mention, such as other potential collaborations (your future committee members), the laboratory facilities, special equipment, special access to research populations/models, track record of previous students, or whatever.  

Then you want to talk about your experience.  What research skills do you have, what projects have you worked on, etc.?

Do not give personal stories.  Nothing about how your great aunt died of alzheimer's and this lead you to want to study brain mechanisms of memory.  If you need to address a red flag in your application, do not dwell on it, or overly apologize for it, mention it an move on (e.g., my GPA is low, but during my initial year in college, I lacked focus.  However, I was able to refocus my efforts in XXX and my GPA within my major is YYY.  My research experience...etc).  Do not reveal a mental health problem.  If you do have one or had to take a break from school because of one, just refer to it as a health problem that is now resolved (there is just prejudice against mental health issues).  Only mention a health problem if you need it to explain a red flag (one semester GPA was bad, took a semester off, now all better).  One or two sentences to cover a red flag is enough to give them a reason/justification but recognition that you are ready to move on.  Keep it under 2 pages double spaced, but longer than 1 page (unless there is a specific word count given).

Good luck. ",2,2015-10-15 08:56:10

* talk to your school's mental health clinic
* engage in *radical* self-care: homecooked meals, regular daily exercise, fresh air, sun exposure, vitamin D, a full 9 hours of sleep every night, and some socialization time every week
* get a hobby
* practice stress-relief techniques, like meditation, breathing exercises, stretching, yoga, etc
* take a vacation
* apply for internships
* start volunteering
* read a book for fun

Undergrads: first I screen by GPA/transcripts and then time commitment (at least 10 hours a week). I used to give more a shot but I get so many requests and so few actually carry through. My secondary screen is a few questions about expectations, career goals (no wrong answer, just want to know how to advise them) and schedule. Finally an ""interview"". I give feedback at every point. 

Masters Students: they are free so I have generally given them a lot of leeway. It's competitive to get one, there were only 5 for 15 open slots. But these have been a mixed bag for me. My first three masters students have been varying levels of disasters. One did enough to get a paper but didn't finish for mental health reasons, another was quite bright but extremely high strung. The third can't pass his classes or multitask in any way. I now have a rule that I will vet masters students as carefully as PhD. 

PhD: a lot of this depends on funding and timing. I've been told you'll spend 90% of the time on your lowest performers in the lab. This has definitely been true for the masters students. Right now I'm feeling out my first PhD student. I expect a lot from them because that's what's required. But it's been a struggle to pull them from the UG mentality to the PhD student mentality. 

My philosophy is to tell the students that unless they are self-starters, self-motivated they shouldn't be in my lab. But this strategy hasn't been working so well lately. I often find myself alone in the lab, they leave early, come in late. I'm trying to change that culture now. I've finally gotten two of the disruptive MS students out (one graduated the other a leave of absence), but we're not making much progress. They don't think they are being lazy, but by graduate student standards it's pretty bad. So now I'm having to spend time keeping them on task because I simply can't afford to have a you'll see response. By the time they have figured it out I will be well on the way out myself!",2,2015-10-11 05:57:29
cvsitlu,t1_cvseeb6,,weisbergian,t2_pjylm,"Consult a mental health professional if you haven't. As many will attest, poor mental health *will* hinder your professional life, and leaving it unchecked just because you're aware of its source (career concerns) isn't doing any good.

That said, since we're on the same page about not caring too much about what others are going through, I'll be blunt:

It's obnoxious that you're self-aware about the length (e.g., mentioning that tweet quote) yet you decide to post a song lyric anyway in your ""earnest"" call for help. Write to your audience, certainly that's something you learned with your humanities degrees.

Here's the rub: You've been unemployed for three years. Unless you're skimping on the details, that's a substantial time and employers aren't going to be sympathetic to whatever personal issues you've had or accept volunteer work as a substitute when you've failed to demonstrate the ability to hold down a job for any significant length.

If you go on to a PhD program, the very real endgame is that you'll be facing the same issues you are now, with an even greater disparity between your age/experience and those of the other job candidates. This would be mitigated by a fallback path that you developed before or since completing your MA, but it seems that hasn't been the case.

On that note, this is frustrating to read:

&gt; So, while I would very much like to pursue criticism via freelance writing, I know that's a risky gambit and I'm quite uncertain about the viability of such an occupation. Plus, there are a lot of related issues that trouble me (let's put it this way, I recently entered the following two words into Google: ""freelancing"" ""pension"").

Have you been doing any freelance writing during those three years or did your risk aversion prevent you from starting? Not only does it provide the opportunity to develop your writing and your portfolio, I don't see how freelancing pensions are relevant when it's being compared to unemployment.

Moreover, you've expressed interest in all these career paths related to film but have you networked with these professionals? It worries me that you write about resumes and film festivals not hiring you while not discussing ways to get your foot in the door. Just because film preservation is a more technical career doesn't make networking any less important.

In short, cast your net wider. It's not just retail, film festivals, or a PhD. I just grabbed an Uber ride in L.A. from a driver who's trying to make his way through Hollywood as an actor after switching careers from TV commercial production and casting.

To get past them I would try to get some help from whatever sources you can. Will your advisor brainstorm some ideas for organization of the intro with you, or like others mention a writing center? Don't try to do it all at once or be a rockstar, steady levels of good production are much, much better than the brilliant idea that strikes you like a bolt from the blue.

That is to say, if you spend a few semesters succeeding in the relevant coursework and explain your situation to any potential lab manager/PI, then he/she will almost certainly disregard whatever hangups you had in the past. You need to prove to a potential mentor that you have worked through your mental health issues, or at the least that you have it under control to the point where it won't affect your work. If you're as passionate about learning as you say, then this shouldn't be a problem :D

And honestly, don't worry at all about switching fields. When I was a freshman I had the opportunity to interview a Psychology professor who told me about how he spent he spent the first few decades of his life studying/working as an engineer, then just up and decided to jump into a Psychology PhD with very little background in the field. Your case is different in a few details, but the point is this: If you love to learn, and are passionate about a new field then it really doesn't matter if you studied something else earlier in life. It's never too late to jump into a different academic discipline, just know that it may be significantly harder as you get older due to a changing lifestyle (you want to settle down and have kids, don't have the energy to work/study long days, etc.). If those issues don't affect you, then you should definitely be able to get out there and live your dreams!

It is tough out there/here. As others have pointed out, academia can be isolating and highly competitive. The pressure to ace exams, publish papers, get grants, etc. can be suffocating. I struggled in my program for a long time - in the early years, it was a bad advisor situation, and I gained a lot of weight, slept all the time (like three-hour naps every day), wore nothing but sweatpants, cried every damn day, thought about dropping out... Then another prof overheard me talking about leaving and stepped in. I started working for her and things improved a lot.

The other really rough period was while I was writing my dissertation. I was doing interviews that were reaaally emotionally taxing and transcribing them all myself, so I would pretty much wake up, sit down at my computer, put headphones on and transcribe details of homelessness, sexual abuse, domestic violence, etc for eight hours straight. I was also on the job market and not having much luck, which made me feel inadequate and that all my hard work was for nothing. My spouse was in exactly the same situation, so things were tense at home, AND I found out that my mother and sister would be moving overseas, which was devastating for me. This dark time cleared up as 1) winter passed, 2) the dissertation came together and turned out really well, and 3) we landed jobs together. I also saw a counselor at the campus clinic to help me through. She was wonderful.

I have just finished my first year on the job. In some ways it was really difficult, like the dissertation period, but I feel like I have more resources to cope. Not gonna lie, having more money helps! I started seeing a personal trainer 2x a week, which has been great for my physical and mental health. I've had some publishing success, and getting my research started in our new area has kept me busy and distracted. I started hiking and geocaching to get me outside in the sun and fresh air.

Sometimes I feel guilty that I spend time exercising and doing other recreational things instead of working more, but I realize that working all the time would NOT make me more productive, because I would be miserable and burned out. I am most productive when I make time in my day for exercising and relaxing - having that time off allows me to spend my work hours *working* instead of, uh, crying and hating life.",7,2015-07-17 21:01:33

It's something I have been thinking about a lot lately. Not only do many people feel powerless because of the issues they are facing, but many also (including myself) feel powerless to do anything about it. I mean, we can set up support groups and mentoring programs, but [there is evidence](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26365-lighting-dark-fixing-academias-mental-health-problem/) to suggest that these might not really help all that much.

You're not the only one concerned about it, but you're right there's not much discussion on the subject as it pertains to academia specifically.

However, there has been a lot of discussion around student mental health in general which has led to universities getting more serious about offering mental health services to students.  It's still not great (at my school you have to wait months for an appointment unless you walk into the dean's office and tell him you're going to kill yourself, true story) but it is improving.  I don't know if there are similar services offered through health insurance for professors, but I hope so.  That's not something I ever see talked about to be honest.

In my experience mental health problems are rampant throughout academia, and it's only sometimes okay for people to talk about it.  Some professors are very open and supportive while others still see it as a sign of weakness.  It's a really stressful environment and you see the same types of problems in other similarly stressful fields (finance, for example).

From an individual's perspective, until it's widely accepted to talk about these issues out in the open I think it's really important to find a core set of friends who you can talk to and be extremely open about this sort of stuff.  I'm lucky enough to have that and it's been really helpful for me.

I think what is important is to start having dialogues about these pressures, and more importantly start challenging these structures that produce these pressures. Why should I have to apply for external funding? Why should I have to publish X amount of articles? Why can't the university promise to hire me back for this position next year? Why are  students charged for tuition? Why are universities funded what the way they are? Why is an academic judged on the amount of publications and not on other factors, such as work ethic, personality, life experience, etc. 

Right now academia is wrought with challenges imposed by various mostly external actors, including administrations, governments, businesses, corporate structures, publishers, etc. We, as individual academics have very little power in comparison to these larger overarching powers.

I absolutely do not. There's nothing to be gained from it. It does nothing but damage you in their eyes, and regardless of whatever the degree of your condition is, your future is more important than confessing something that, at this point, is almost completely meaningless.

My advice is: Have a closer look and try to find a common ground. And if there is nothing you can either create it (show and teach one of your interests with them... Maybe a bunch of you like anime or knitting or drawing or birdwatching or who-knows-what, the possibilities are limitless) or you can look elsewhere. ",3,2016-03-09 23:22:56
d0txs5a,t1_d0tvrn2,,captainNematode,t2_mqmbc,"&gt; I want it to be hard such that some people ""freak out"", because I want those people to be weeded out by anxiety and difficulty, and I want the others who approach it in a more competent and measured way to be more likely to get funded.

Is this because psychological disposition is strongly associated with research(er) quality, which is what we're trying to optimize for? Or because being calm and measured is valuable in itself? I'd only care about making people anxious insofar as it helps them improve (in the sense of eustress), and less as a hazing or weeding mechanism (because I don't think you're targeting the trait of interest -- people can be great scientists and do excellent work while still being susceptible to anxiety or other mental health disorders, and the trial-by-fire, dog-eat-dog sort of atmosphere doesn't seem conducive for maximizing quality research output. In any case, students have the entirety of grad school and beyond to grow tougher skin, and a more nurturing environment might help more here. Obviously not ""*too*"" nurturing, but you could just as well make it even more demanding by getting rid of PIs and program resources -- let the best fend for themselves and they'll sort themselves out! Who knows where the ideal balance lies).

&gt; Also, I'm sorry that you didn't know about it as an undergrad, but I view this is part of the weeding out too. 

Hmm, well in my case, I only started looking into and strongly considering grad schools around the time the apps were due, and was leaning towards industry or government work before then. Lots of students aren't thinking of grad school at all, then, though -- rather, they're entering the workforce (and deciding to go to grad school much later) or getting research positions (or going into Master's programs) to better feel out how well an academic-y lifestyle suits them (which is a very common piece of advice!).

&gt; The student who either gives enough of a shit to learn about it or goes to a school where they make it a priority for people to learn about it will ON AVERAGE be a better candidate than somebody who either didn't care to learn about it or went to the type of undergrad institution where they don't make that a priority.

I guess this depends on how widely available information on the GRFP is if you're not already aware of its existence from prior chance exposure. How often do people apply for and get the GRF (or the Hertz, or the NDSEG, or the FORD, or the SMART, or the DOE, or the NPSC, etc.) without first hearing of it from their PIs or mentors (or friends)? My impression is rarely.

And sure, I agree that people from better schools (/departments/programs) are probably on average better students in that they've already been selected by the previous round of filters. But even purely from a meritocratic standpoint (no egalitarianism whatsoever!), who cares?! We should be trying then to select the best overall from the total pool, and not sampling preferentially from previously designated bins if we don't have to.

&gt; I think the potential of top applicants will be obvious right away. For example, in sports, you don't hold secondary try-outs to find the best players; you have them to get the top of the next tier.

I don't know enough about sports to really comment, but athletes could just as well have a bad day on the field (or w/e), could they not? Having a second round of tryouts with feedback from the first could help them fix the easy fixes and let their ""true"" potential shine.

Anyway, this whole change was spurned by the NSF's desire to increase diversity, which I don't think it's effectively doing.",12,2016-03-09 22:19:12
d0qzzq4,t3_49cno5,,[deleted],,"I've never heard of a university or government agency contacting a specific researcher to ask them to research something (although that's not to say it has never happened -- just that if it does, it's rare).

As others have mentioned, the government does put out general calls for research on things. For instance, you can see here [things the NIH would like people to submit funding applications to study](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/search_results.htm?year=active&amp;scope=rfa).

But you don't need to be responding to a request for applications in order to submit an application. You can request money to study anything you want -- you just have a better chance of getting it if the funding agency has specifically said they're interested in funding projects on that topic.

Businesses do sometimes solicit specific investigators to do stuff for them. I know of one business that has some kind of nutritional supplement that they believe improves cognitive abilities, so they gave money to a neuroscientist I know to test out their product to see if it really did improve cognition or not.

Sometimes, if you're really lucky, you don't need to ask anyone for money. I have a hypothesis that I developed years ago that has been in the back of my mind since then (that a common medical treatment can improve symptoms of a completely unrelated mental health condition). Conveniently, the institution I work for grants researchers access to an enormous database of de-identified health information that will allow me to test that hypothesis. So for that I just had to get permission to use the database, and now I can test my hypothesis and if I'm right, write a paper.",3,2016-03-07 18:16:25

d0f716i,t3_47raxj,,woxihuan,,"&gt; the things I'm interested in learning and understanding are graduate-level, maybe even PhD level stuff.

I'll help clear something up here, which is easy to not know: ""graduate"" is a terms that applies to MA and PhD levels. Both MA students and PhD students are graduate level. You're thinking in terms of a hierarchy of smarts, when really what it is is a narrowing of specialization(s) and switch from coursework (MA) to research (PhD).

Graduate level work is not necessarily about intelligence. It's true you need a basic level of intelligence, sort of - but it's *more* important that you're dedicated, hardworking, and increasingly refining your skills and area of interest, all while being self-motivated.

Graduate school coursework is advanced training in the theories of your discipline. It's also training to work in academia, which is kind of an intense as fuck process of enculturation. Also remember - academia today is more of a profession than it was before, and it's increasingly more a business. You'll need to work 40+ hours a week in graduate school to stay on top. It's not easy, because unlike a job, *you'll* be the one making yourself do those hours. You'll also be trained teaching, research, and service functions for the job, which may or may not be useful to you, but are essential for academics. Things like grant writing, committee meetings, planning sessions, that stuff.

Intelligence and curiosity aren't necessarily part of it. Focus and willingness to be devoted beyond the norm are more important. For you, if you're just interested in, say, Digital Humanities, then just look into industry-related jobs and see what you can do with a BA. 

As for your grades, those are too poor to get into a program right now, so you'll need to improve them to keep the option open in the future. I would suggest trying your best.

The biggest deterrent is your mental health. Take me: I am a perfectly mentally healthy person with great self-esteem, near-perfect marks, a solid teaching background, and good writing - and even *I* am feeling a litte like a failure in graduate school. There is a culture of mental unwellness that is almost inescapable. ...I honestly think some of it might be from malnutrition, at this point, because of our lack of funding haha.

czmt11x,t1_czmrfst,,Animostas,t2_4sqg4,"I was an undergrad at Columbia, where I think a fairly high portion of the students went to psychological/counseling services at some point (myself included). I also have a number of family members involved in academia, so I feel I have an ok grasp of mental health awareness from both the students' and faculties' point of view.

I think the main thing to do for classroom settings is to make it really clear in your syllabus what to do in the case of mental health emergencies, stick to it, and never mention it again. Something like, ""You can delay a homework submission or exam if you have a note from psychological services or a private counselor,"" or change it however you see fit. I like this a lot because it gives leeway to people who really need the help, but it also prevents students from being coddled, which sort of be the environment of colleges nowadays. It says, ""If you need some additional assistance because of personal issues, that's fine, but it's your responsibility to bring it up because I, nor the TA's, can read your minds.""

On a similar note, make sure that you and your TA's are on the same page about most things: grading policies/strictness, class notes, etc. I've had so many TA's who didn't know anything about class lectures, which is fine because they're super smart and know the material, but would end up using totally different notation that what I was used to. It started to feel like I was struggling against the professor than against the material.

For the setting of your research group, I think a good way to think about it is that you're like a small business owner without an HR. Which is cool because it's intimate and creative, but sometimes your students suck and can be annoying to each other. I would encourage them to be able to come to you if they have any really irreconcilable problems. But most importantly, it's an incredible morale boost for the professor to just be in the office with the door cracked open. Knowing ""my professor is around working as hard as I am, probably even harder,"" is so priceless. The worst mentors I've had were the ones who just threw me to their grad students/postdocs while they were never in their own room and doing God knows what. I'm not asking them for recommendations because there's no way they even know me.

Funny tangential story: My friend's mom is a doctor, and she had two residents who were polar opposites and were completely incompatible. One was a girl who was book-smart but didn't have much common sense (wanted to test a kid's genetics for hereditary diseases when he clearly just has a cold), and the guy was sort of a douche who was condescending. So the doctor immediately pulled each of them aside after the first day and was like, ""This is not going to fly. You have to be cordial, and let's set boundaries and try to learn."" Just be professional, and you'll generally find that people aren't trying to be assholes, they're just stressed and taking it out on each other.

Getting the highest level job is pretty hard, but if you are willing to work up to it that means doing home visits, after school programs, etc.

If your personal life sucks, then it's even worse. I was very depressed in college and threw myself into my work. I needed serious mental health assistance by my 3rd year.

Grad school was a much better experience for me psychologically, but only because I got real help in college and learned how to deal with stress, accept failure, and balance my personal and professional lives. In grad school I was surrounded by people who didn't get that help and they were miserable. That will be you if you can't sort out your issues in advance of attending.

Also, you don't have to go to grad school: now, or ever. There is a whole world of jobs between a dead-end job and academia, it's just that you have never been out in the work world and looked for them. I hadn't either. But they're there, trust me.

Take elective courses in philosophy, history, political science, ethics, criminology, sociology, etc.  You should have some type of pre-law adviser on campus, and they can advise you on the best classes.  You really want to focus on your research skills and thinking analytically.  You also want to have a high overall GPA.

As for med school, you can major in psychology but you want to have a strong natural science background.  You really want to be making A's on your 1st year level science classes (biology, chemistry, calculus/stats, physics and mostly A's and a few B's on the more advanced classes, organic chem, genetics, physiology, cell bio, etc.).  You need to make all A's in your psychology classes.  The more science classes you take, the better.  Consider getting a minor in biology (or look into neuroscience if your school has it).  Look into getting involved in a professor's research lab.  Pick something interesting, research is research.  Neuroscience, psychophysiology, or health psychology would be more relevant to medicine, but anything is better than nothing and you can spin almost any areas as being relevant.  Once again, find your school's pre-med advisers. 

You can spin the benefits of having a psychology degree for either medicine or law in your personal statement.  That is all in how well you write.

As for what else you can do with psychology...basically a BS/BA in psychology is a general liberal arts degree that does not train you for anything in particular.  It can give you strong basic skills in research and critical thinking.  Where you go with that is up to you.  If you want to stay in the mental health field, the good jobs are going to usually require a graduate degree.

I am looking to go to a state school for grad to save money. From the investigation I've done, I don't think there are any Master's in counseling in my state. There are Mental Health Counseling degrees, Clinical Psych degrees, General Psych degrees, etc. I'm not interested in going out of state or private for my Master's.

You'll get the experience to decide if pursuing a PhD is something you're game for, and if so, you'll have the experience on your resume to help you get in.  If you hate research and want to go the more clinical route, there is nothing wrong with an MSW.  Friend of mine just finished her MSW and got a job at a school making a reasonable starting salary.  Burn out is an issue everyone in mental health care has to proactively address, and we discuss strategies for this in our training.

While it likely will not make you money, I'd recommend trying to find a volunteer clinical position as well.  As an undergrad, I worked on a general mental health crisis hotline and a sexual assault crisis hotline.  Those places train you and can be very supportive experiences, depending on the site.  That experience will also be two-fold: it will help you decide if you want to do clinical work in the real world and, if so, it will help you get into a MSW/PhD/PsyD program.

If you take a year or two after you get your BA to do work that is related to psyc, you will be much more competitive if you apply to grad school (thinking here of PhD specifically - with good grades I would bet you could get into an MSW straight away).  

Do not do what other people want you to do.  This is your life, and it isn't a dress rehearsal.  I remember the stress of trying to make these decisions, and the uncertainty makes for a difficult time.  At the same time, it's exciting because so many doors are open to you.

It is absolutely the case that there are pros and cons to MSW vs PhD vs PsyD.  For me, PhD was the right choice because 1) I do not pay for my degree, I get paid to get my degree, 2) I am interested in forensic assessment for the courts, which prefer the PhD.  I am sometimes jealous of my friends who I graduated undergrad with, as they have just finished their MSWs while I am starting year 3 of my PhD program.

Your freeze proposal would easily be blocked by the claim that it was too risky-- ""how could we stay in business if we risked missing our retention goals over five years???""  But clearly it *should* be studied, rather than accepted uncritically.

I can with some certainly say, however, that in the case of my institution while the ""quality"" of the students coming in has remained steady (per ACT/SAT scores, GPA, etc.) their readiness for college and ability to self- direct toward academic goals has indeed declined. In our case that has resulted in a major increase in funding/staff for mental health services, disability services, academic support services, etc. Some of the residential life staff investments were probably necessary as well.

In your case, though, it sounds like you're having the opposite academic trend-- lower quality/less selective admission. One could counter, though, that those students come with greater need for support structures and the staff required to provide those services. How do you test that without risking failure for a significant number of students over multiple years?

These evaluations are very tricky. Clearly there are ridiculous examples of featherbedding and bloat at many schools...there are far too many obvious examples to not take it seriously.

cif9fo3,t3_28wglu,,Brattipatti,t2_cvl4x,"It's hard! Rejection is part of the package- if you really feel you cannot handle it, perhaps consider another profession. Your mental health and happiness are not worth losing! 

If you are committed, here are some of my tips:

1. Asses your professional strengths and weaknesses. (and realize that everyone has them!)- maybe writing formal manuscripts isn't your strength. That's ok. Realize what you are good at.  Have you gotten amazing feedback on lecturing? Are you the social superstar at your department? Can you read 10 books at the same time? Whatever they are- know what you're good at, and know what you need help with. I HATE asking for help, but when I focus on all the things I can do well without asking for help- it makes it easier to accept the things I just can't excel in on my own. 

2. Recognize your accomplishments. In most fields, being a PhD students means that you have done a lot! take the time to remind yourself of those. Read your CV! It is not easy, but celebrate your accomplishments and focus on them. even small things like ""I completed 9 of my 10 goals this week, AWESOME!"" instead of ""I can never finish all my goals, I suck""... honestly, be aware of your perspective and try to focus on the positive. 

3. Try to consider other end goals in submitting to journals than just publishing. This sounds weird, but if you make it an exercise in something else, rather than getting your paper accepted- you'll be ok with any result. For example, you could submit to journals for the following reasons: getting feedback on a potential chapter; seeing if you can fewer negative comments than the previous time; challenging yourself to submit 3 articles over a year. See how none of those have to do with the outcome? I have found this helpful (especially with funding applications!). It's kinda like the ""you'll find love when you stop looking"" philosophy- but it does take the rejection sting off. If you are not doing it to get accepted, you won't care if you get rejected.

It is appropriate to let her know the true reason for your absence. Don't unburden your problems on her, but just let her know in brief. Do seek counseling from the university ASAP. If you already have been doing this, you might be able to get a note from them explaining your situation in clinical terms while preserving your privacy as much as possible. 

PI's often have to deal with students cracking under the stress. I've known plenty of cases where PI's have been sympathetic about mental health issues. Possibly because many of them have been in a similar place in grad school. I've known a case where a young woman grad student developed such severe anxiety that she couldn't leave her room for weeks. Her PI negotiated with the university to make sure she wasn't in trouble. She managed to coax her student out of her room and drove her to the airport so she could fly back home. After recovering at home for a semester, the student was able to come back to school the following year. The same PI took her back and she went to publish and defend successfully.

I'm someone who has worked full time while working on a PhD. My scenario was rather unique, and while it was really difficult, now that I'm nearing the end, I see that it was the right thing for me. The reason is: I'm going to hit the academic and professional job market with nearly seven years of full time professional experience that's directly related to my degree (plus being able to maintain a decent standard of living, having retirement accounts, broadening my network, paying off student loans, saving for a house). I've also been able to keep a similar time table to my peers who had GA positions, or didn't work at all. 

Would I recommend it? Absolutely not. Can some people do it? Sure.

Why I don't recommend doing it: Burn out, burn out, burn out. The feeling of constantly treading water just to stick your face above it isn't a pretty one. You'll constantly be split between your job and your academic work, never really able to give 100% to either. I find that concerning if you're a mental health professional, as your clients need to be 100% present. 

As some of the other posters mentioned, going to an institution that's not going to support you in some capacity isn't really invested in you. However, in the field you're interested in, the financial support isn't really going to be that solid to begin with, unless you're going to a top program. There's a big difference between a ~20k stipend, and a full time professional salary, so I can see why you would still want to keep your day job if you have debts.

In addition to these reasons, the most important thing to remember is that life happens to all of us. The challenges I've faced in this process (and my peers, too) are going to be a true test of your grit and resilience, and not necessarily in a good way. Issues of health, exhaustion, relationships, death, family, whatever...they're going to happen - and you're still going to have to write. Consider if that's something you really want to deal with in addition to your job and other responsibilities. If it is, then that's a huge skill you'll need to maintain as an academic - it's the kind of work that never really leaves you. That's sort of the beauty of a lot of full time jobs, many of them, you can leave at the office. With academic work, it's ALWAYS with you.

cnn21jg,t1_cnmobaj,,CornLobbyist,t2_51zod,"Having interests and hobbies outside of academics is important for long-term success, short-term and long-term mental health, and for maintaining high quality of life. The attitude you're conveying isn't going to lead to more productive people in academia or more effective training.

This is pretty commonplace, and I think it makes perfect sense - it's a way of rewarding someone for working hard and learning the material by the end of the course even though they struggled with it at the beginning.

Some of the students are saying it's not fair because you could do the same thing - study hard and learn the material you initially struggled with - without going to see the professor. While that's true, you can't be rewarded for effort that is not visible. The professor has no way of knowing that you went to a study group if you never talk to the professor. If it matters to you that you be cut a break, you have to make your studying work visible by actually going to the professor to discuss the material and the assignments.

The students are also saying that this penalizes students with anxiety disorders who are too afraid to talk to the professor, but to me that is an example of untreated or ineffectively treated mental illness interfering with your schoolwork, not something that is the professor's fault. Absolutely I think professors should work with students who have mental illnesses  and work with the disability office to provide the appropriate accommodations to that student, but if you can't even bring yourself to tell your professor that you have an issue, the professor can't help you. And at some level, there are always going to be certain things that are necessary to academic success - such as participating in class discussions, giving presentations, giving speeches, participating in debates or simulations, etc. - that are going to be tougher for students with social anxiety. The solution to that is going to be context-dependent, and sometimes there will be alternate assignments that can be worked out in collaboration with the disability office, but at least some of the time the answer might be that you have to complete the assignment or drop the class until you are at the level of health necessary to meet the requirements.

cplokx5,t3_2zr8on,,possiblegirl,t2_kn4vg,"This sounds like a really stressful situation, particularly if you're already prone to anxiety. I'm sorry you're in this position; having had some difficulties in my own undergraduate career (and having also graduated with a ≈3.0 GPA), I can definitely sympathize with the difficulty of dealing with the ramifications of life after college. I would second what /u/Impune has already said, and add a few other thoughts:

You mention that your mental health issues are currently largely unmanaged. I don't know the details, of course, but I would tend to recommend that you wait to apply to graduate programs until you feel you have these issues relatively under control. Grad school is a really intense environment that can bring out mental health issues even in those who might not have believed they were prone to them, and it might well exacerbate the issues with which you're struggling. (For a somewhat disturbing discussion of this, see [this article](http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/mar/01/mental-health-issue-phd-research-university).) I am *not* suggesting that people with mental health issues shouldn't go into academia; indeed, I--and many of my colleagues--have struggled with such things. But I would say that it is important to start grad school from a point of relative stability, and to have figured out reliable and healthy ways (whether this is therapy, medication, or other coping mechanisms) of maintaining that stability.

Once you have these issues reasonably sorted out, you might want to see if there's a way you can formally or informally take more courses before applying to graduate school. This would allow you to build connections that could get you stronger letters of recommendation and to potentially improve your transcript (if you were taking the courses for credit). Once you apply, I'd recommend starting with MA programs (preferably one that offers funded TAships). Like extra pre-grad school coursework, an MA can allow you to develop connections, grades, and writing samples that will make you a stronger PhD candidate. (I did both of these things--informally auditing classes and doing an MA--and they were invaluable both from a pragmatic point of view [in terms of improving a somewhat shoddy undergraduate portfolio] and from a personal point of view [in terms of helping me figure out how to navigate the academic world].)

Finally, regarding not being picky--while this is a generally good attitude to have, I'd urge you to think carefully about the costs and benefits of various programs. In the humanities, graduate programs are typically intended to prepare you for a career as a professor. And--unlike undergrad--the more highly regarded programs generally pay *you* to attend (via fellowships, TAships, etc) rather than making you pay, precisely because grad school is to a large extent a form of academic apprenticeship. If a program will require you to spend substantial amounts of money and doesn't have good job placement, I would think hard about whether it's really worth it.

You're an Australian PhD student, which means you presumably get 4 weeks of paid holiday time a year (depending on your scholarship/funding). Have you taken them? Take them. Take the whole month all at once and go to Cambodia, or Costa Rica, or Nepal or anywhere that isn't where you are. Do a tour and meet new people or just backpack around for a while, but get your mind off of what you're doing. Hell even if you just take a road trip down to Melbourne or something it's at least doing something different.

My supervisors and committee are very adamant about me taking all of my time off (hell they've even told me I can take more, as long as my work gets done). It's important to your mental health to take a break for a while or the work will consume you. I was in Europe last year and my supervisor told me not to worry about answering emails while I was gone. Do this and then come back and do your last year.

So this is something that I think could gain a lot of momentum, but there isn't a good way to do it right now. Journals are expensive, researchers aren't interested in training people outside academia and there really isn't any good way to easily filter out bad papers before an expert has to review them.

There are tons of reasons to not do academia apart from lacking the capacity: finances / horrible pay, location, can't find a suitable advisor, rampant mental health issues in the environment, etc. 

If no academics are willing to supervise, perhaps we can form communities of intelligent people, communicate and peer-review what we can. It seems like a fairly natural next step from accessible online education and the elimination of paywalls. Well managed communities are quite possible; many open source projects are extremely selective. 

Hobby doesn't mean part-time. Many people work far harder on their hobbies than their jobs. I think it would be extraordinarily difficult, but quite possible. Many more PhDs exist than jobs for PhDs; there may be a willing population of people out there already who have an interest in continuing their work. ",2,2015-02-21 23:46:34

I can send you a link to the papers. Essentially, runners are smarter :-D 

Other exercises, including weight lifting, sprints, and other anaerobic short bursts, benefit overall metabolism which is critical for the neurological system to function. Do it for your brain, bro.  Don't actually say that in the gym.

Great! You need to be exhausted. It's like a palate cleanser. Smelling coffee beans does not make you like the smell of perfumes, but it enables you to smell it better. If you're not hauling balls in the gym, you really are wasting time, because you should not be able to think about other stuff while doing it. Not only do you improve your physical health, but you create moments of silence to reduce worrying. You seem like you worry a lot. Worst advice ever is ""don't worry so much"", right? Workouts won't prevent you from worrying, but they will increase your stamina and mental endurance.

  If that's not the case, then there are still avenues you may not have tried; a personal tutor, logging extra time with the TA or prof, and letting some of your credits slide until the summer (when you can concentrate a little better on a smaller workload) are all viable options.

Everyone loves to read about the latest cancer research, mental illness research, breakthroughs in our fight against alzheimer's.  But no one really can actually differentiate a real study from a fake one.  

Prime example, Reddit front page.  You have submissions titled, ""Mice Autists found to carry bacteria that can solve world hunger.""  And everyone will lose their minds b/c getting rid of world hunger is awesome.  None of them care that the sample size was 12, it was a convenience sample, and the study only tested the association one way.  You could see how HuffPost could drive A LOT of views to their website if one of their health journalists picked up a crock study from Belgium that claims to have found a link between cuffing your selvedge jeans and cancer (even more so than a cure b/c everyone loves to hear about ""danger"" - negativity bias and so on).  

So, my study, revolves around the 1998/2004/2010 Wakefield-autism-mmr-vaccine controversy and how journalists handled the debate, that was by no means contentious, and how they decided to portray that struggle.  

You have a lot of health blogs and huffpost leading on the public and its understanding of vaccines/autism by not definitively declaring outright that 12/13 original investigators of the study withdrew their sponsorship (2004) or that the Lancet (the journal that initially published the study) partially retracted the study in 2004 and then fully retracted it (after ministry of health or whatever found evidence of fraud) in 2010.  

Then why do so many wealthy, well-educated families on private insurance opt to exempt their children from vaccinations?  

My dataset is pulled from the top 10 newspaper dailies in America, from 02/02/2010 - 02/02/2011 (the lancet pulled the study in 2 feb 2010) and is going to try and codify and analyze what journalists were saying about autism and mmr vaccine the year after the study was retracted.  How much of it was sound medical reporting and how much of it was sensationalist/preying-on-rich-mothers'-fears?

I'm sorry to hear that. As /u/ThSGM pointed out, in cases like these, it's usually very helpful to have someone at your current school who can vouch for your character and academic abilities. Perhaps you can speak to one of the teachers in the courses that you did well in? 

E-mails are very easy to disregard, in my experience. Or answer bluntly. I would argue that a call is a good way to go, since you won't have to make a 3-hour train journey only to find the office closed or the person unhelpful. If possible, contacting the disability services department at the school might be a good first point of contact. They can then refer you onwards to other people if need be. 

I'm not doubting that your course has made your depression worse, but simply saying ""I didn't like my course of study"" isn't likely to impress the people making admissions decisions. Having good marks in the course you want to go on instead will help. Having good marks in the course you want to go on and a letter from someone vouching for your abilities in that course will help further. If that letter can also vouch for your past mental health issues and say that you have been proactive in addressing them, that will likely help you a great deal.

cbafj02,t1_cbaauf1,,rpglover64,t2_4a1gd,"Firstly, there's an opportunity cost: you spend 5 to 7 years getting paid a small (compared to what many fields could make in industry) salary/stipend, or possibly not being paid (typically, but not universally in humanities PhDs). According to [this](http://chronicle.com/article/PhD-Attrition-How-Much-Is/140045/) recent article, you have even odds of completing a PhD program, and though there isn't _much_ data about it, and it varies significantly by institution, [this](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6070/864.abstract) paper suggests that if you manage to _get_ a tenure track position, you have only a 50% shot of getting tenure (but see SnowblindAlbino's [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1j1uwt/undergrad_here_planing_on_going_to_academia_with/cbafydc) below).

Now it's not entirely unreasonable to view tenure as a holy grail: good, though not superlative pay, flexible hours, and incomparable job security, doing (probably, if you manage to stick with it) something you enjoy. But it becomes less rosy if you look at your other job prospects for the next 10 years and compare your savings and psyche if you earn more but live off the same amount.

For the most part, though, sacrifices come in terms of the difficulty maintaining a good work-life balance. Matt Might has some more [advice](http://matt.might.net/articles/work-life-balance/) on the topic; crucially, he makes the point that ""As a grad student, it's important to list the things for which you would give up on your Ph.D."" Which would you choose if you had to choose between your PhD and your relationship, family, health, etc. It's not that those choices _will_ come up but that they _might_, and people are bad at rationally dealing with sunk costs.

There are many programs that are, let's say for the sake of not being judgmental, _incompatible_ with some students, and you often can't tell if you're going to have problems until you're months or years in. Sometimes its due to your advisor (too harsh or too lax are the nicest reasons for incompatibility); other times its due to colleagues or an unconducive work environment; yet other times it's due to geographical location and/or inability to find your niche. Being in such a program takes a mental toll, decreasing your life satisfaction and your work quality.

You'll learn to cope with stress and self esteem issues, or you'll have a bad time, but you may have long streaks when you can't deal with it. Sometimes (e.g. paper deadlines) you will be in crunch mode; sometimes when you're in crunch mode, and stressed as a result, life will fuck you over (e.g. breakup, housing issues, illness), and you might not have enough of a reserve to deal with it gracefully, so you mess up the paper and now you have _two_ problems to deal with.

You are probably not getting into Harvard with that, and I/O tends to be quantitative stats heavy, but having several publications as an undergrad is really going to help balance out the low quant score.  Also talk about your experience analyzing data and especially your stats (and stats software) skills you got from doing all of this research.  

If you apply to I/O PhD programs, tell them in the application that you plan to do academic research.  I don't know if this will help, but I know I/O programs often have trouble getting people to finish their PhD because they eventually get a good job offer in industry and they leave the program.  Telling them that you want to be an academic means that you plan to stick out the PhD.",2,2013-10-28 12:55:11
ccztzu4,t3_1p4fv1,,thekingofpsychos,t2_anfd3,"I'm a Master's psychology student who is doing research related to this area so I'll give this a shot. Positive psychology is different from the more traditional fields, especially abnormal psychology, because it places an emphasis on studying the *strengths* of humans, rather than their *weaknesses* or *vulnerabilities* More specifically, it looks at traits such as self-compassion and resilience, which would be totally ignored in traditional approaches to studying mental health that emphasizes looking for pathology. 

I know positive psychology sounds like hippy, ""feel good"" pop culture but it's a legitimate sub-discipline with a lot of empirical research. But it's kinda of a niche sub-field and there's only one grad program for positive psychology that I'm aware of. Generally, it's more that there are numerous professors scattered across universities that have research interests in looking at positive psychology; my research advisor is one of them.

EDIT: As for ""academic perception"", it's really hard to say but positive psychology seems to be accepted well enough by most psychologists. I know that right now, mindfulness and meditation are hot topics of research and those concepts are related to positive psychology.",2,2013-10-26 03:36:13

So, simply, there is nothing particularly controversial or problematic with positive psychology. The work is produces is generally well-respected and highly regarded as the field is composed of rigorous scientists who value objective evidence. 

The only complaint that I ever hear about the field is the terminology it uses, which is often very flowery and/or can have connotations that laymen object to. For example, one of the key findings in positive psychology is the relationship between ""spirituality"" and better mental health outcomes. Many non-theists react negatively to this claim but it makes more sense when we look at how they're defining ""spirituality"", which is usually operationalised as something like ""belonging to a strong social support network"" or ""has an appreciation of something greater than themselves (like community or family)"" etc. 

As for Fredrickson's embarrassment - it was shitty science and it got called out. This happens in science all the time. It's not like her ""critical positivity ratio"" was integral to positive psychology or had any great sway over the field (like debunking the theory of evolution in biology). ",2,2013-10-25 03:58:41

I actually don't disagree with your point--even the best researchers need some mental health time now and then.

Some of them will doubtless go to their deathbeds wishing they had in fact worked a little harder to achieve their goals.

cfscpts,t3_1zburs,,[deleted],,"I can only comment on my field from the perspective of a potential graduate student in clinical psychology:

1. Get rid of interviews. Base evaluations on applicant files, references, publications, standardized scores, work experience, etc... Interviews are unreliable as hell. How can you show your best side when your nerves have turned you into a shaking, blubbering fool or an aloof motormouth or what have you.

2. Get rid of the ridiculous gender bias. We've done a full 180 over the past few decades, where men are now in the minority by a huge margin. Research shows that this effect is independent of applicant gender ratios and individual merit. Not only is it unfair to male applicants and unhealthy for academia, but it means there's a severe shortage of male clinicians and psychotherapists. 

3. Place more emphasis on mental health, personality, life experience, interpersonal skills, and other factors that indicate an applicant's potential as a helping professional. Yes, research potential is important, but way too many clinical grad students look great on paper yet run away from therapy as soon as they realize they're not cut out for it—or worse, they keep going and become horrible therapists.

4. Make admission less dependent on compatibility with lab and supervisor research. The system is set up so that only those students are accepted who are deemed most likely to help publish successful research that guarantees funding for the supervising PI. Pursuing your own interests and carving your own path leads to better science and happier scientists. 

5. (Accept me into the clinical psychology graduate program, damnit).

If it does not move beyond this I don't think it's worth complaining. I'm sure the quiz is set up in such a way that everyone get an area of weakness no matter what. I think the quiz is a result of sloppy work pulling together course materials more than anything else.

A bigger issue is the lack of scientific validity of this quiz.


The 2nd assignment you mentioned does sounds kind of invasive. A lot of the questions are personal, not just the religious ones. It's one thing to assign the quiz to get people thinking about what wellness is as a concept and whether they agree or disagree with how the quiz operationalizes it, but an assignment asking you to discuss the personal topics in the quiz is asking a lot. 

I think there are a couple of ways to approach this without compromising your opinions:

1) Operationalize spiritual in a way that you are okay with. For example, I'm an atheist but maybe I could decide that spirituality is really about self care and mental wellbeing. Does not matter if this is what the quiz meant, but you you easily make an argument that this is spiritual health and talk about how you'll take time to relax and balance work with fun to avoid stress. etc etc

2) You could use the worksheet to argue about why you disagree with this need.

I think 1 is the better choice. Pick a definition of spiritual that works for you and go with that. 

I think this assignment really is about poor planning on the profs part probably based on materials from the textbook company that were not carefully reviewed. If this is the only incident of this nature in the course I don't think it's worth escalating. If other things happen then escalate, but this one incident may be a misunderstanding.

I'm not sure if your exact answers are being returned to the professor. If so, then that is an issue. That's no one's business. Don't complete the assignment and talk to your professor. However, I would think this is just a personal assessment, for you to see where you might fall in a world perspective. 

As far as ""Spiritual Health"" I think that's a bit of a misnomer. If the assignment said, ""Let's look at your mental wellness"" it would make you think you had some sort of psychological issue. Or people would assume they're getting a psychological evaluation. 

A quick search for ""health and wellness spiritual health"" shows a few classes which discuss the topic. Generally, what it means by that phrase is ""How are you feeling in life?"" Religion is a source for people to find hope and greater good in the world. If one believes in a deity or some higher power, then a person can fall back on those teachings for inspiration or guidance. For others, alone time to think about life and goals is good enough.

**TL;DR:** Talk to your professor if s/he will be seeing your exact responses. If it's not reported, this is just a personal assignment -- like taking the personality tests -- to see where you fall in a well-being continuum. 

**EDIT:** If you do talk to the professor, don't come out angry, and don't say you're offended. You're not offended. You're concerned about what will be done with the responses you gave.

c64p8jm,t3_zg9cs,,PsiWavefunction,t2_56tif,"It may perhaps be helpful to know that beyond the facade, a significant portion of the academic community has seen or is seeing mental health professionals (or if not, probably really should be... ;-) ). It's far more common than you'd think. The academic career is quite rough on the life part of life -- it's stressful, demanding, competitive; plagued by uncertainty about employment; subject to the schedule and rhythms of your pesky brain; underpaid; hard to evaluate own performance; and just for fun, you usually move (far!) every few years, ensuring that the little social life you've set up on the side gets swept under the carpet. In other words, extremely unhealthy, and the longer people have spent in that world, the more likely it is that they've either developed or discovered various mental illnesses in the process.

Faculty should be experienced enough to understand. Provided they're not socially inept/aloof/lost in their own world. Which happens, and that can get ouch. But if you're working for a somewhat functional human being, it shouldn't harm them to tell them you are having issues (don't get too emotional or detailed unless they care) and are working on them -- who knows, maybe they can even advise you on the subject.

I think as society at large becomes more educated about mental health and the taboo is gradually eradicated, we'll discover that there's a lot more medical basis for human struggle and suffering, and mental issues will be easier to at least talk about. People usually don't berate you for being unproductive while fighting cancer or being down with a flu...",2,2012-09-07 06:48:47
c64p2jj,t3_zg9cs,,dr_vez,t2_7h3dz,"I am going to agree with the folks saying that you should talk to a counselor. I see a counselor regularly. 

I just finished my 1st year of grad school, and I suffered from depression through most of it. Most of it was brought on by a break up (from my partner of 7 years) and the remarks/actions of my advisor at the time. So I switched advisors. 

I made the choice of opening up to my new advisor and telling her what I was suffering from and the reasons why (since it was mainly from the previous advisor). She was actually super supportive in the beginning. I thought whew! I can actually focus a bit more on my own mental health and getting better than always having to push through everything and push aside what I am going through. It really felt awesome to have my advisor on my side and care about the REAL me as opposed to just the ACADEMIC me, since you really do give so much of yourself to this academic/professional endeavor. 

I thought I was on my way to having a healthy relationship with my new advisor all summer until this week she said: ""I know I came off touchy feely but in the end, I am all about business.""

It bothered me so much. All I could think about was why is mental health treated like it doesnt fucking matter??? There are several other things that happened during the summer that greatly affected my ability to concentrate and work and just lead a productive life period, but it was all boiled down to that comment, and it hurt...a lot. 

So moral of the story? Don't tell your PIs/advisors. I learned the hard way. It is just safer that way. Talk to people who care and who actually understand what is going on and can actually help you through it (i.e. a professional counselor/therapist). And if it begins to affect your work, just get a doctor's note. PIs/Advisors understand that ""business exchange"" rather than you actually being honest about your limitations as a human being. 

She made it clear that she wasn't a counselor and wasn't meant to fit that role, and I totally get that. She is my advisor. I know. But since we have a close working relationship, I thought I could be real, but I guess not. It sucks....it really does. :/

So, it’s fine to ask them what graduate school is like more generally; if program a or program b would be a better fit if your research interest is xyz; if they could give you advice on what sort of job to seek next to set yourself up for success; if they could connect you to anyone they know who does xyz research, and so on. For me, in this sort of situation, boundary crossing would be revealing too many details about mental health, low key insulting their profession/career choice (eg insunuating you want MORE than their position, not just different), pushing them too hard on details about graduate school (some things would be more appropriate to ask current grad students, for example).",1,2020-08-11 01:51:51

this might not work for everyone but it really helped me coax my mind to sit and start doing the actual work.

I am SO sorry this happened to you. I hardly ever reply to Reddit posts, but yours struck a chord with me. Almost the EXACT same thing happened to me a little over two years ago. Please, for the love of God, TELL SOMEONE. I did not do this and suffered almost two years as a result. 

I was under very similar circumstances. Alone in the lab with my PI (I was an undergrad at the time). The PI also had a wife who WORKED AS A TECHNICIAN in the lab! And she had a suspicion something was happening. Anyways, he confessed his ""feelings"" for me very similarly to how your PI did. Said he cared about me a lot (this is BULL SHIT -- DO NOT FALL FOR IT LIKE I DID). I was shaken up. Left the lab and just sat on a bench outside to compose myself. Told my boyfriend at the time (we eventually broke up because of this situation) to come see me as soon as he could because I needed to vent. My words were ""my world has completely turned upside down"" and boy it sure did.

Please tell your school. Don't worry about repercussions. TRUST ME. You'll suffer way more emotional trauma if you keep this to yourself. Leave that lab, NOW. I know this is extreme but this is your for mental health and emotional well-being as a human. Please please please tell the school and get out of that lab.

Just to provide closure for what happened to me: I ended up getting in a relationship with the professor. I broke up a four-year relationship that was going well for me because I was baited into his remarks. He divorced his wife. We were on and off for two years. I hid it from my parents and pretty much lived a double life, which caused severe emotional trauma.

1) it's unethical and flies in the face of working scientifically, which is what the PhD is 

2) you can't falsify data well, you will make it fit some hypothesis (most likely yours)

3) you don't have data to draw conclusions from and may hence end up drawing conclusions that would be easy to dismiss given the data (or for peers and seniors such as the PhD committee) 

4) the chance of being caught is not small (and you may be caught in all perpetuity)

5) once caught, you will not only rightfully loose all scientific credibility, but your credibility in any other matter (and for any other job) also suffers massively

Systems as large as academia are very resistant to change, so to enact change a critical mass of participants in the system needs to acknowledge these issues as a problem and demand change.

You are not your PhD. Leaving a PhD program with an MS is not a bad or shameful outcome. For students looking to work in industry, it can actually be more financially lucrative. I’ve seen students grind extra years on a PhD that isn’t really a good, productive project and be continually failed by their advisor. They would have been far better off mastering out.

The deadlines were unrealistic and he was impossible to satisfy. I found myself working on holidays, throughout the middle of the night and still feeling like I was lacking... it sucked and I’m really sorry you’re in this position right now. 

Eventually I realized that he needed me and I needed to protect my time and my mental health. I just was never going to make him happy so I at least needed to make myself as happy as possible.

gf5kchv,t3_k9nxh6,True,polyphonal,t2_bvkqt,"The anxiety may benefit from some therapy/counselling - if it feels like that's the way to move forward, go for it.  The only other way I know of is to develop confidence in your abilities and outputs.  I'm going to only address that second option, because I'm not qualified to discuss the first.  So the question is how to do more/better work, and how to feel better about what you're doing.

I agree with the other commenter: break your work down into clear, well-defined tasks so you see yourself actually making progress and know where you're going.

More broadly, remember that increasing your efficiency is a far better strategy than increasing your hours. I'd suggest that now (and regularly) you step back to take a hard, clinical look at how you use your time and evaluate what environment or tools make you more productive. I know it can be hard to do when you feel behind and overwhelmed, but that's exactly when it's most needed.  After alll, you're better off spending 6 hours working at high efficiency than 10 hours working at half efficiency. Not only will you get more done, but your mental health will be much better. Be proactive about experimenting with how to increase your efficiency.

It's important that you take regular breaks, limit your hours to something sustainable, and have healthy, diverse hobbies/friendships.  This is not a sign of weakness; it will benefit your work as well as your overall wellbeing.  On the other side, though, it's also important to be use your breaks to do something that actually refreshes you, whatever that is. Design your breaks to make you feel genuinely rested or happy and able to get back to whatever you need to do, not just to procrastinate or wallow. 

Lastly, every time you start a new task, first estimate how long you'll need for that task. When you finish the task, go back and check how bad your estimate was.  This is going to be a painful exercise at first - most people are terrible at this.  However, once you get better at estimating how long things take you, you'll get better at planning out your time and you'll feel more in control of your schedule and outputs.",1,2020-12-09 09:57:35

A few pointers, then:

* Write a detailed outline of the thesis and get it out to your PI and whoever else you need to asap.  Get feedback on it from a few other people if you can.  Your detailed timeline is a great idea, definitely do that.

* It will get busy and frantic, and when things get that way it can be easy to feel like you can't afford the time to take a step back to re-plan and consider the big picture.  This is a false economy: when deadlines are tight, you can't afford to *not* do things correctly the first time.  So set some time aside very regularly (weekly?) to look back over your thesis plan, evaluate your progress, and make the changes you need to make to get this done.  

* Get all your tools in place.  Make sure you're comfortable with whatever bits of software you need (your reference manager, or styles/template tools in your writing software, for example).  

* Keep a running and thorough list of all the small jobs that need to be done on the thesis, even really small jobs.  Personally I found this really useful because any time that I was having trouble starting to write, I'd instead just knock off a few of these easy minor things and that would help. 

* Make sure you know how you work most efficiently, and make that environment/schedule happen as much as you can under the circumstances.  It's far better (for your thesis and your mental health) to spend a few hours efficiently than many hours inefficiently.  

* Remember: not only is it impossible to write the perfect thesis, but doing so would be an incredible waste of time.  Your thesis should be good enough to comfortably pass the requirements, and no better.

If you have challenges around you mental health you have to really consider if any exposure to academic life beyond undergrad is for you.

Is that enough time?  
It can be mentally exhausting before you even start work.  Then when you do start there's just a never ending amount of work to do and it you might have to scrap it in a couple of months.

If you really want to do a PhD you should do it.  But you should recognise that it can just exacerbate underlying mental health problems.  I've been doing mine during the pandemic with many lockdowns, I feel it would have been easier if not for this.  Sounds like you'd want to start soon though so you would be in a similar situation.

Especially because it sounds like this class really has you stressed. It's ok, sometimes it happens.

If you withdraw from the course, it will definitely affect your GPA because the credits attempted will still count, but you're not earning those credits. If you've never dropped a course and are above the minimum GPA requirement for your fin aid and scholarships, you should safely be able to drop the course. 

That being said, reach out to your fin aid office to ask if dropping this course will negatively affect your aid, bc I don't know what your award, tuition, need, etc, looks like. Also, if you drop a class too early in the semester, you will be required to repay that financial aid back to the college.

If you are unable to withdraw from this class, find out if you can receive tutoring services. I haven't heard of a college that doesn't offer free tutoring. Finally, look into whether your school has a grade replacement policy. If you can't drop, and tutoring doesn't help, retake the class (with a different prof, if possible), and file a grade replacement form.

To start with that: Some PIs are batshit crazy and you should run while you can. A PhD isn't always worth keeping up with their crazyness and destroying your mental health. Sometimes cutting your losses and leaving is indeed the better choice, even if it's hard since it'll obviously halt your career for a bit. But your career isn't worth destroying yourself over.  

But your PI is still your boss and expects something in return for welcoming you in their lab.  
How much they can demand depends on the nature of your employment (e.g. my contract outright stated how much work time was reserved for my PhD and how much unrelated work could be expected from me). You also shouldn't forget to evaluate not only the direct benefit you gain from complying but also the possible negative influence if you refuse. With that I don't mean ""Do whatever your crazy PI demands"" but especially if it's a task that can quickly be done and that needs to by done (not like others will be more eager) it can be easier to just do it and not burn bridges with your PI (who basically holds your degree hostage) by refusing or wasting everyones time by trying to argue about it when it anyways needs to be done...

ggjgikk,t3_kghb0q,True,Schiaparelli,t2_8a5z9,"Have you worked a full-time job before, or seriously looked into potential industry jobs that resonate with your intellectual interests?

I ask because the impression I get from your post is that doing a PhD and becoming a professor in your areas of interest is not just _a_ dream, it’s  _the_ dream. And because of that, you’re trying hard to convince yourself (and get affirmation from this community) that it’s worth pursuing this dream, even though getting a tenure-track professorship is intensely competitive.

I’m not here to lecture you about how grad school in the humanities is pointless, and that you should prioritise employability and earning potential above all else. I did my bachelor’s in a STEM program and I’m now doing an MA in a history subfield I’m passionate about, so I do understand how incredibly meaningful it is to get to pursue your passions.

But! If you see academia as the _only_ dream and the _only_ path you can be excited by: I would strongly, strongly urge you to expand your horizons and develop a more nuanced view of what’s possible in a non-academic life. There _are_ jobs where you can work with interesting, kind people who will expand your intellectual horizons and shape (and even change) your world view. There *are* jobs where you can teach others and be deeply energized by mentoring and encouraging others (which is what I got to experience before I began my MA!). I want to emphasize this because a lot of posts on r/gradschool seem to be written by current undergrads/fresh graduates who think that their _only_ choices are ‘pursue my grad school dream, live my best intellectual life, but maybe be unemployed’ or ‘resign myself to the late-capitalist horrors of industry and always long for what could have been’. If this isn’t you, apologies for assuming. But if it is…

I’d recommend *seriously* considering what a non-academic life looks like, one that you could enjoy and even thrive in. This is not to say you should give up on your grad school dreams! You could live this non-academic life for a few years, save up money, develop new skills, and be a more competitive applicant to a grad school program later on. You could do an MA and then decide that a PhD isn’t for you, and then begin your non-academic life. You could do a PhD and then choose an alt-ac career. You could do a PhD and apply for tenure-track roles and pursue your dream of being a professor, knowing that—if you can’t land a highly competitive position—you can still look for an intellectually fulfilling and rewarding job elsewhere.

In my case, I worked for a few years between my bachelor’s and MA and it’s made my MA experience so much better. I’m still considering doing a PhD and, like you, have dreams of teaching. But the academic job market in my field(s) of interest is seriously bad—likely similar to what yours would be in English/theology—and it’s not just about getting the job after the PhD, it’s all the sacrifices that happen during the PhD. Numerous people in this thread have already detailed the financial, emotional, and mental toll of it.

If you can give yourself options—and give yourself the mental space to get excited about other paths—you’ll be much better equipped for whatever path you end up taking. **Even if you end up going to grad school after all.** It’s good for your mental health to be able to envision a life outside academia (especially if employment stats in your field get you down).

After completing prelims, a prospectus, and a substantial amount of research, I found myself in a *really* dark depressed state for innumerable reasons, most of which were opaque to me at the time but were in fact related to academic culture and a larger sense of dissatisfaction with how academia and scholarly culture operates (socially, economically, politically, etc). And one day I was brooding yet again, wishing I could walk away from the whole thing, when I suddenly realized that I *could* walk away, that there was literally nothing that could stop me from walking away if that's what I chose to do. And it sounds like an exaggeration/cliche, but as I stayed with that thought for a minute and explored it, it felt like my body got ten times lighter and a sort of clarity emerged.

I did, in fact, finish. I almost left, but in talking through things with a mentor I realized that if I approached the remaining work differently I could probably bust it out pretty quickly. But it was actually realizing I could leave that gave me the strength to finish, and I know that if I *had* left, I would have had no reason to regret it.

My suggestion in finding students/post-docs/professors in your field that you can approach with day-to-day or general questions can help you limit your contact with this postdoc and only see her when necessary to discuss specifics of your work.

I would still try to talk to your PI. If you tread carefully in how you word your frustrations, I don't think you will necessarily come off as a ""tattle tale"".

You can ask your PI about her expectations in terms of your ability to write papers/proposals, your level of understanding on certain topics, or how independent your PI expects you to be at this stage in grad school, etc. It would probably come up naturally that your postdoc seems to have unrealistic expectations for you and you can discuss her behavior in that context.

I also don't know about how formal this process is at your university, but I think some aspects of your petition here - while I understand they are true and likely difficult to talk about - are a little too informal in my personal opinion, and at some points are somewhat emotionally charged. I think it would be more beneficial to stick strictly to facts, and I think you could do with some significant rewriting.

I don't think you need to go into such great detail about the conflicts with your family. I think summarising it succinctly might work better, because at the moment the bulk of your petition focuses on what went wrong and your steps to improve your situation are overshadowed. Your focus is proving you are capable of continuing next year, and figuring out if you've overcome to obstacles that impeded you this year is going to be the committee's main priority. At the moment, the focus is on your past problems, and while I understand why you've done that, that's not what the committee will be looking for. They're not evaluating who had it bad enough to merit a second chance, they're looking for who is capable of returning to university in a better place - if that makes sense. 

So, for example, the section beginning with ""To begin, I need to describe what the root cause of my downfall this year has been. "" and ending with ""urs before an evaluation, completely stressed out even though I had practiced weeks in advance and knew the content"" can be better summarised. ""Downfall"" is, in my opinion, one of the examples of phrasing that is  too emotionally charged, too dramatic. Instead I would remove all of that sort of detail and instead say something like:

&gt;For the 2018-2019 academic year I was living with my mother who has a severe form of paranoid schizophrenia. In addition to having to handle her other paranoid delusions, my mother frequently behaved this past academic year in a way that was detrimental to my learning and my ability to perform successfully in my courses, such as restricting my ability to attend evening lectures and confiscating my electronics, including my laptop on which I complete all of my homework. 

&gt;The stress of having to live with and manage these behaviours caused my own mental health to suffer, and despite my best efforts, my performance in my classes was negatively affected. 

Then I would go on to detail the steps you've taken to better your situation: you're seeing someone at CAMH, you've moved out. I would keep the bit about how you regret not getting help sooner (though honestly I'd probably cut ""I tried to reach out to CAMH multiple times however, the sheer ignorance and lack of understanding about mental health and the stigma revolving around it bested me. Plus, I tried going there in February &amp; March a couple of times, however I came back dissuaded because of the long wait times at the emergency services. "" because it isn't really relevant - you didn't get the help because you were in denial, that sums it up well enough) as it shows you've learned from your mistakes and can now move forward. 

I would also cut that you have been ""traumatised"" by Math, CS &amp; Stats - as again, too emotionally charged. But I would say that having audited these classes during this past year you have a new direction that you're more excited about, and you're keen to take a new step forward with a new program now that you've gotten the help and made the necessary changes that have resolved the problems you had last year.",4,2019-06-29 20:42:38
erxbn5r,t3_c4k8ih,True,phryna,t2_sce4k,"I'm a tenure track professor who advises PhD students. I'm hoping to give some constructive criticism - all I know about you is this post and there are many things about who you are, your capacity as a person and student that I can't possibly know and thus this advice is unidimensional. 

There are a lot of red flags for me as an advisor in your post that would make me very reticent to accept you into a PhD program. 

My advice would be to go out and get a job, and if you still want to pursue a PhD in a couple of years, go for it. It will still be there. The reason I say this is manifold:

1) It seems like you should work on some mental health issues before delving into a stressful and demanding environment - I do not mean to be condescending in this - I personally take sertraline for anxiety. But you need to establish a controllable baseline before entering a program if you want to come out the other end healthy, 

2) You need to really, really know you want or need a PhD to get where you're going. My program is biomedical - 75% of our incoming PhD students express a desire to gain a tenure track job. Our completion rate is \~50%, and of our graduates, around 15% gain TT positions within 5 years of graduation. I'm not sure on the stats specific to psychology PhD programs, but I can't imagine they are horribly different. 

Furthermore, studies have shown that the shortfall in earnings from not having earned money during PhD are not made up for by increased promotion in industry, and having a PhD can impede success in the job market for entry level industry jobs. 

The numbers say you probably won't get a job as a professor, and the PhD might well hurt your chances of employment post graduation. So absolutely don't do it unless you're sure - it could well end up being a dumb hat, bit of paper and half a decade's worth of resentment if you aren't crystal clear on why you're there. 

3) A PhD is much more akin to an entry level professional traineeship (e.g. cadetship in a law firm, residency in med school) than a continuation of undergraduate studies. The workload, required professionalism, expectations of productivity are often a critical, unsurpassable shock to people coming straight from undergrad with poorly matched expectations. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I would go get a job, earn some money, gain some workplace experience. Know what you are giving up to go to grad school and if you still want to do it after a couple of years, you will be better prepared financially, mentally and experience-wise to succeed. Best of luck.",4,2019-06-24 12:39:33
erj1pmn,t1_eriuf7d,True,v_jade,t2_yr4kp7k,"I've been working on this for about two years now. For a little more than a year I worked on it alone. During this time I discovered the novel phenomena that is the basis of the paper. Then, the postdoc joined the group and started out helping me. Since my project was working it was a good way to introduce him to the lab since I could teach him about all the experimental process involved in fabricating and measuring a working device. After I taught him these things he stayed around on the project because we work well together and I was happy to have him.

He has given a lot of effort to this. I would say one of the most substantial things was there was a period of several months over which we were measuring nonstop and someone had to have an eye on the experiment at all times. So I volunteered to do the night shift and watched it for 12 hours at night and he did the one in the daytime. He also helped with other things like some simulations of the data. I'm very happy to have him as second author.

After reflection I realized that all of these things--that I made the discovery before he was there, that I worked on it for over a year longer than he did and even in the last year it was my sole focus while he also did other things-- this made me believe that authorship in this situation shouldn't even be a question. I have a hard time standing up for myself and generally don't think well of myself a lot of the time, so I think that's why it took me a while to see it for what it is.

And that's why I'm a bit upset with my advisor. I can't believe he'd make me doubt myself so much over this, especially since he knows about my mental health issues. I'm not sure if I'm totally off base here, but my impression was: He's a young Prof up for tenure soon. The kind of jobs his postdoc gets will influence his image especially in this earlier stage of his professorship. So perhaps that's why he wanted to stretch the  authorship in this work. Idk, I could be wrong. But I do feel slightly betrayed.",1,2019-06-19 02:59:21

I think I only got through it because I have a partner who isn't an academic and who makes enough to support our family.

If you want to have a conversation with an academic advisor and want to be clear on what they must disclose (such as a sexual assault or abuse), I would recommend asking them before you begin that conversation. They will tell you exactly what they must report.

If there is something that you'd like to discuss with them that they would be mandated to report but you don't want leaving the room, many universities have contacts for confidential advocates. Sometimes they work for the county, and they're usually licensed clinical social workers who can listen to you without being forced to take it anywhere.

You know you're thinking irrationally and your own assessment on your work is probably affected by that. You can't trust your judgement of yourself right now, so if you start kicking yourself with thoughts of being a failure, etc.. you have to remember that those thoughts aren't trustworthy because they're not coming from someone in a good place. Some CBT might help with this, but the point is, you don't have to agree with the negative thoughts, work on countering them and rejecting them because logically they are not aiding to your success or wellbeing.

My scenarios were:  It could be so bad they would kick me out with nothing - never happened in my department and chances of it happening when a supervisor likes your work is slim, if it happened to me I'd find a new career and move on.

I thought the PhD was not terribly hard--I had moments of suffering and mental health issues, but they mostly stemmed from things unrelated to the program. 

What destroyed me was the job market, working full-time in academia, and seeing how people are treated. The job market is a crap shoot that will make most people doubt their own value and question themselves about every single aspect of their personality and intellect. I would say I am psychologically more fragile than many, and it seriously pushed me close to the edge many times. 

In my first job (VAP), I was harassed sexually by a colleague and psychologically by my department chair. I was depressed that entire year. At my current job, none in my department is insane, but the administration is absolutely s\*\*\*ty and morally abusive (eg. I have many colleagues who have resigned because they were bullied in their departments and the administration was just: ""oh, nothing we can do"". This is super disheartening). Also, as long as you don't have tenure, you are basically at the mercy of everyone (students, colleagues, administrators). Are they yelling at you all the time? No, but they wield a tremendous amount of power over you. 

I am in a TT job now, and going up for tenure next year. It looks like I would get it, but at this point I am so sick with all of this that I am debating going through with it.

ewe1cn7,t3_cnou73,True,BraveLittleEcho,t2_emn12,"I'm a tenure-track Assistant Professor in Psychology at a small regionally focused liberal arts college, which makes for a pretty different looking day-to-day than my colleges at R1 schools.

In a typical semester, 2-3 days a week I get to campus about 9:30am and teach an early and a mid-morning class. I meet with students/research assistants, and/or go to useless meetings (service) for a couple hours, then teach a late afternoon class before I leave campus. I like to take a little time for me (go to yoga, run errands, cook dinner) and then in the evenings after I get home I catch up on grading and/or lecture prep and/or email for a couple hours. 

At least one day a week is usually a ""service heavy"" day on campus. I go to committee meetings, do departmental service, and attend professional development workshops. Some of what I do is total bullshit (I've sat in an hour long meeting about changing to LED lightbulbs our office lamps) which eats into time I'd rather be doing other things, but I think all jobs have some of that. I try to grade and prep lectures between things (or occasionally during things) and sometimes manage to carve out 2-3 hours for research these days when I have an active project/deadline. 

At least one day a week I try to work from home. I try to save 3 hours these mornings for research and/or conference calls with collaborators. In the afternoons I prep lectures, grade papers, and deal with email backlogs. Sometimes I cut out early these days and hang with loved ones, but sometimes I work until much later than I should. 

During busy times in the semester I certainly work longer hours (get up at 6 to get a lecture prepped or spend 20 hours of my weekend grading), but those balance out with weeks where the workload is lighter. I'd say I average about 45 hours a week during the semester, but they can range from 25-70. One huge perk is that things are flexible, for example I tend to take part of every Friday off to spend time with friends/family or work around the house, but I also generally save about 4 hours on Sunday afternoon/evening to get ready for Monday morning.

I know some people in similar positions who work A LOT more than this, but after running myself ragged in graduate school I decided that it was more important to me to find a position that offers me some balance rather than a more prestigious one. I'll never be a famous big-name researcher but I've got a great relationship with my partner, I see my family and friends lot, and I make time for my hobbies. Basically, I'm here to say that an academic career can be a really, really wonderful thing if you find the right niche for yourself. Don't let other people tell you what type of job you ""should"" have or ""can"" have--- search for something that feels right to you and plays to your strengths and the lifestyle you want.

I'll add these general stuff again in here just in case these haven't been reiterated enough:

I wish somebody told me to take feedback from supervisor, peers, etc more often and not think about the voices in my own head too much. As a then first gen masters student (and now as a phd student), I had no idea of how to evaluate myself and my progress in my projects, since there's no traditional examination when it comes to research. I learnt it late. Learn how to evaluate your progress by yourself, and keep track of where you are heading.

Speaking of voices in your head - social life is necessary. Even if you are a huge introvert like me, get out of your head. Go out. Talk to others. Do things that you like, outside of work. It helps with your mental health.

And exercise helps with the physical part of your health. Eat a balanced diet (can be very tough in grad school, but try hard). Take care of your body. Grad school will finish one day (or you'll quit, whatever). Don't lose your health in pursuit of your work.",1,2019-12-11 23:20:32

Here is the situation: the lead author is my current PI, who is a perfectly nice guy and has conceptualised the study. The study is exclusively on HIS patients. He and the HOI are both medical doctors, so I don‘t think their statistical education was as sound as mine. I have a BSc/MSc/PhD in psychology and thus, 4 semesters of solid stats education. And then self-taught stuff and so on. My lead author/PI would NOT be able to this stats it I told him what he needed to do. The HOI knows sort of what to do and does it, and mostly does it kinda well. So that‘s how they collaborate on projects. 

Once this project is over, I‘ll have more projects with this PI whom I like working with. He‘s reasonably patient with me and kind.

Why can't the advisor find another person to supervise the PhD student? Or why not have a sit down meeting with the student and relevant stakeholders to set up an agreement to guide involvement and expectations going forward?

In the very least, the advisor should wait until the student is in recovery before making any changes to the student's PhD, since this situation is likely to cause more harm to the student during what is likely a pretty rough time for them.

I'd definitely be escalating this issue and asking for a grace period to post-pone any decision-making until the student can be involved and speak for themselves.",0,2019-12-01 23:44:31

Here are the things that made a huge difference for me: 

• The most significant change I had to make to my mindset was accepting that it's okay to do work that's just ""good"" when making my work excellent feels agonizing. A finished fellowship application is better than a perfect one that's impossible to get ready on time. Sending out two good proposals is better than exhausting myself trying to perfect one. This really helped me with procrastination because I found that, for me, it came from a place of performance anxiety. I was so worried about doing really well that I hardly did anything at all. With how much work the program requires, sometimes ""finished but not amazing"" really is an okay level of quality to expect. 

• I can't stand working in the office alone. I have to work with someone else (it's so much less alienating with a little company) or at least in a café or some space with human activity around me and ideally some sunlight. I also got together a few friends with whom I regularly meet to share work, and the support and community have been wonderful and a major confidence-booster. 

• I had to find a hobby and make myself schedule time for it. I take at least an afternoon or two a week to work on my photography, which I haven't let go of as a serious side project. It reminds me that the Ph.D. isn't all-consuming; I do have a life outside of school. 

• I really had to get back to a self-care routine. Now, I block out 45 min to an hour every morning for exercise, do meal prep to save myself time and stress during the week, etc. And I had some overdue bloodwork done. Taking care of vitamin B and D deficiencies helped a great deal with mood and energy levels and my overall feeling of wellness.

I had some personal tragedies during the process, too (I lost four family members and a close friend, two to suicide, during my PhD), and my research required me to travel abroad for months at a time, which was very isolating (even more so than a PhD normally is).

Extended time in low paying career path. In the sciences, the average time to finish a PhD is extending past 4 years, with an average of 5 years, and 8 years not being uncommon. This is for fields like chemistry, neuroscience, biochem, pharmd. Pair that with a post doc, sometimes 2 post docs, and that's 6 to 12 years spent at really low salaries for really huge work loads. Think 60-100 hour weeks with 20-30k student stipends, and 30K post doc salary, but now you have student debt to pay off during post doc. It's not fun.

Narrow job prospects. There are few job prospects for PhDs with rare exceptions. If you are great at demonstrating translatable skills, you'll be fine. If you're in hot research areas like drug development and testing, medical devices, and engineering, there is a market for advanced degrees WITH job experience. Outside of that? A PhD wildly overqualifies you for many jobs. They don't need a PhD for a production lab manager (usually).

Now, I encourage all students to be mindful of their limits/habits and learn from my mistakes.

Go for it if you’re willing to accept that your prospects for a full-time teaching position won’t increase too much and the competition for TT jobs is fierce. The market is saturated with PhDs without permanent positions. Full-time NTT positions are often temporary—expect to find a new job or even move every 1-3 years. More likely is cobbling together adjuncting gigs without benefits. Publishing in top-tier journals is not easy, and even then that doesn’t guarantee a job. 

Accept 3-6 years of a 20k salary often distributed over nine months, and that you will have to provide service to the university. If you’re lucky, that’s being an RA on a research project related to your interest, or it’s teaching, as a TA or instructor-of-record since you have an MA. Teaching will take time from coursework research, and publishing. Just as your job does now.

If your reasoning is mostly about being more competitive for full-time college teaching positions or fear of losing health care, I honestly don’t think that’s sustainable. First, a humanities/social science PhD is far more likely to hold a part-time or continent position than a full-time TT one. Second, grad school can be very isolating and take a toll on mental health. 

You need to have a very strong desire to produce knowledge that contributes something new to your field and/or teach in higher ed—this is key for resilience. Also useful is a financial safety net—the stress of survival can wear a person down if their funding runs out or if they find themselves without a job secured after graduation. It can also be motivating—but the state of the job market and hiring decisions are beyond individual control. 

If, after all this, you still feel compelled to work towards a PhD, I agree that you only go if you get funding and tuition waiver. Do not go into debt for a PhD primarily useful for academic jobs.

The advice to treat your PhD like a job is very important, though I would also stress how important is to then make time for yourself outside of the PhD. It is a strenuous process and having hobbies and other loves to sustain your broader sense of satisfaction is key to seeing this thing through to the end. Having little projects at home can also help to fulfil your sense of completion when the end of a PhD can feel so very far away (it creeps up on you though!). Prioritising your mental health is crucial!

Also, I recently read what is considered to be one of the [most helpful Reddit comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af) and an element of that comes to mind here. Rule 2: The 3 yous. Essentially, be grateful for the work past you has done (even when it is not as much as you would like, because it's still something) and always try to do favours for your future self. Don't put off writing until the last possible moment, do your future self a favour and jot down a little each day. You may not use all of it in your thesis but it will make a fantastic springboard for further ideas and may end up being useful for future publications too. To be honest, all four of his rules apply to PhD study if you fancy giving them a read.

e4eq11d,t3_987dl5,True,MasterPatricko,t2_ch1z2,"I have a few thoughts after reading your story. I am not hugely experienced so feel free to disagree with my view.

I think you are being a unrealistic about how much freedom a postdoc working off someone else's grant money has. In many ways it is actually less than as a grad student -- the project (or person) which is paying for your time must get priority. A postdoc is generally NOT an independent researcher.
And yes a lot of postdoc work may be quite menial, especially in a small research group. Telling your PI that the work feels beneath you and is lab-tech work, in a small resource-constrained lab like yours seems to be, would seem incredibly arrogant to me. If you are being forced to do tasks inefficiently, or if your wider facility has other people/resources that your group is not using, that's different; your PI should be receptive to process improvements, but you as the junior member of the lab can't get out of doing what needs to be done.

Your PI has shown some understanding on a personal level (there is dialogue, even if it's not perfect), and you mentioned you are picking up new skills. Honestly I would say this part of it doesn't sound too bad.

One part which does worry me is that your group is losing members and you have made no mention of any research going well or the group adding new members. If new grants are very infrequent, no new collaborations, if there is no prospect of students joining, you don't want to be tied to a long, slow, inevitable decline. In which case get out as soon as possible without actively antagonising anyone (you still need references).
If this is only temporary, then when the group grows back to a healthy size, it will also relieve your frustration by dividing the work better, and giving you someone else to talk to during the day.

I would say you get to decide your own direction when you start writing your own grant proposals and start bringing in your own money.
There is no reason you can't start doing this now.
Either your ideas succeed, which is a nice bit of external validation for you personally, and probably takes a load off your PI's shoulders -- with your PI's permission, you could even try to start a few new collaborations; only the most petty of supervisors would be unhappy about their postdocs succeeding in this way.
Or your ideas fail, in which case you know your PI was not just being difficult in rejecting some of your proposals, and you gain a more realistic view of academia.

If it is really impossible to do this in your current position, and you really can't stand working without complete academic freedom, for your next position I would suggest you try looking for early-career fellowships, rather than postdocs on existing projects. I would still try to leave in a way which maintains a good relationship with your current PI, which might mean finishing your current contract -- references are hugely important -- but obviously don't completely sacrifice your own mental health for that. And note you can start applying for new positions well before your current contract is up (this is usually expected).

e89k1zk,t3_9qdmia,True,BrockProf,t2_vjpewdg,"I'm a social epidemiologist (and Asian) and I work in intimate-partner violence (also in discrimination and mental health). I think the best way to produce useful research is to work closely with community groups, clinicians, and policy makers already engaged with your topic. Many of them have years of experience working with your population group and have a good idea about what questions are useful. 

The worst thing to do (if you want to do primary data collection with vulnerable populations of any kind) is to burden people with research that will not be used and do not actually improve their wellbeing. There are too many researchers out there (particularly in the social sciences) that do not produce research linked to solutions. Work with people to design and evaluate solutions. If you are not directly working with people able to implement your suggested solutions - don't expect that someone someday might read your article and be inspired to do something (this almost never happens). 

Design, implement and evaluate the solutions yourself. We really don't need more papers on social determinants of intimate-partner violence and the impact of violence (Unless you're doing secondary data analysis - then have at it since you won't burden people too much). ",2,2018-10-22 23:08:22

For me, that looks like binge watching TV without thinking about the 'big picture' of how this affects my community, and swearing off twitter for a little while.

I 'reserve' (for lack of a better term) my passion and ethical responsibility to my community when I am conceiving the project and determining how to go about the work, and of course, the activism that may follow it after.

e5tyhfm,t3_9f4oig,True,orion726,t2_77dwx,"It may take a little bit more time to adjust to the swing of things before you can properly hash out your schedule. A few things to keep in mind:

* Schedules can vary wildly. You will have periods of time when there doesn't seem to be enough hours in the day and periods of time when you can take off early everyday and it won't impact anything. These periods will line up differently for different people so it usually is a good idea to not compare your schedule to their schedule. 

* The start of a semester is usually hectic for everyone, even more so for new grad students. Don't treat the first few weeks (or even the first semester really) as a barometer for how the rest of your experience will go.

* You may have to force yourself to schedule down time. This is OK and it is better for both your physical and mental health. Try not to have the mentality that you have to choose between a good night's sleep and a successful academic career. 

* Weekly meal prep can be a big time saver. I love cooking but found myself too tired at the end of the day to want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen. Having meals made in advance is both healthier and cheaper than getting take out on those days.

e9m4toa,t3_9wnsf6,True,DocMondegreen,t2_wnbu1,"I switched advisors a year into writing my dissertation. I wish I recognized our incompatibility earlier, or that admin had recommended a change sooner. I would not have been nearly so far behind and I'm sure my mental health would have been better had I just done it earlier. 

It sounds like your admin supports you, which is really important. It means that you are not being blamed for this relationship. If another prof is willing to supervise, that means that they want to work with you and don't mind any backlash! Seriously- they wouldn't take on this duty unless they wanted to. One of the most common ways I've seen students get ""forced out"" of a program was when they lost their original advisor but no one else would advise.

How to Deal:

You are now in the uncomfortable role of employee/student who did nothing wrong but could be blamed because the boss is a jerk. You will be extremely polite and disengage from gossip. You will say mysterious and knowing things like ""It just wasn't working out, you know"" and ""I'm sure his \[topic\] skills are extremely strong."" When you don't badmouth him, he'll look like the asshole, especially since you were the student and he had the power in the relationship. You are the Ice Queen who will not give him the satisfaction of knowing he hurt you, even if you cry at home or in the bathroom. It will make you look like the mature person in this situation. It sounds like he's not in town often, so you won't have to keep this up every day, either.

Along with this, get in the habit of CYA if you are not already. Document your interactions and your work regularly. Send email after meetings that say, ""To confirm/summarize, I'll work on x, y, and z, this coming week."" Imagine that all of your emails will be read in front of a court, so keep them totally professional. 

I know that this sucks, but you can get through it. If everyone knows how this guy is, it really won't reflect on you that much. Other profs will say things like, ""Oh, So-and-so almost tanked another student's career,"" but they'll focus more on his behavior than yours. It sounds like admin might already be tracking his behavior and building a case for reprimanding him (maybe firing him, if you're lucky). After graduation, no one really cares who your first supervisor was. They'll maybe care about who you finished your project with, but more likely, they'll mainly care that you finished.",2,2018-11-13 13:01:53

&amp;#x200B;

To clarify, you're a UK student who was studying abroad for a semester and 'failed' modules there, correct? The first thing to understand is how you failed. Are we talking a soft or hard fail, or a failure to submit?

&amp;#x200B;

It being during a study abroad period might be in your favour, as your home university might be more accommodating. Failing two makes that trickier, but they'll be able to advise. As another poster has suggested, you need to be talking to your personal tutor and the director of studies for study abroad (or similar) immediately. Actions talk, here.

&amp;#x200B;

You can cite mental health issues. They'll be taken seriously, but to be frank, we rarely consider them retroactively.

&amp;#x200B;

If this was a home university concern you'd be able to resit these modules during the summer vacation, and I assume there will be capacity for this within the study abroad system. The key is to not panic -- primarily because panicking won't help anything.",1,2019-01-15 20:39:53
ee591en,t3_agcl87,True,foibleShmoible,t2_i61ju,"Mental health is a serious matter, and not your fault, but you do need to take responsibility for how you handle it. Ideally, when you first started struggling you'd have reached out to your director of studies/personal tutor to talk about the problems and any accommodations you might need. Now you need to do the same thing, but after the fact it is harder to prove that your existing issues are genuine and not just an attempt to cover for poor performance.

A few things. First off, are you getting support (from your doctor or a counselling service - your university should be able to refer you to the latter if you aren't using one yet)? That will help you with your issues, while also providing you with proof that this isn't just you trying to pull one over on them.

Secondly, talk to your personal tutor **now**. Send them an email ahead of term starting and explain briefly that while you were away you had issues with your mental health that impacted your work, that you understand you should have raised this much sooner, but now you would like to discuss what you need to do to stop this happening again next semester, what accommodations might be necessary and can be made in future, and if there are any possible ways you can make up the failed modules (unlikely but you might as well ask). Ask for a meeting with them once uni starts again to discuss it all in more detail. And make it clear that you aren't just asking for a pass/concessions here; you know that you need to put in the work but that you just need help figuring out how best to do that.

Thirdly, reach out to your student services. Your student union will have a welfare person/team. Ask them for any guidance that might be specific to your university, particularly if you find you have trouble working things out with your personal tutor.

Finally, DON'T PANIC. This is 2 modules out of, what 12? 16? They don't necessarily have to sink your entire degree, or your academic aspirations. Get things straightened out, figure out a plan so that you can succeed at the rest of your degree, and see where that leaves you. Different universities have different ways of figuring out final degree classifications, so these two modules probably won't be the end of you. Talk to your tutor and welfare people, and go from there.

The power structures in academia are deeply troubled and cannot be salvaged. 

For example, a first-year female PhD student was convinced into coming in to the lab at absurd hours to check on experiments. This was a bit frustrating, but she thought it was just something she'd have to be willing to accept to her to pursue this wonderful opportunity!

Over time, her advisor began criticizing her work. There were mistakes and she was pressured to increase her hours in the lab. She saw less of her friends and became more committed to finding a way to please her advisor.

By the second year, she was spending nearly all her waking hours in the lab. She had little contact with anyone who was not part of the lab. She was fully committed. She was in the lab alone at night and in weekends, except for when a post-doc or the advisor were there. She was dedicated to her important work! 

**She was repeatedly sexually assaulted.** After a long period of silent trauma, she made a complaint. The department protected the advisor. She left the university and got a job working at a grocery store.

It doesn't matter what field you are in. The power imbalance in academia is exploitative to the very core. A math student is just as likely to put a bullet through her brain as an literature student.

Do not be complicit in systems of authoritarian exploitation. Do not go to grad school. 

You can study anything you want on the internet. Get a library card. Make friends with the research librarians. Check out scholar.google.com and Web of Science. Ask the library if they'll get subscriptions to any journals they don't already have.

Find a group of people who are interested in a similar topic. Have conversations online or in a coffee shop or on camping trips. Check one another's work for errors and then share it online for free. If you need money, tell the people you know what you are working on and ask if they can help you out with living expenses.

Get a ham radio license and buy a schoolbus. Ask for help on irv2.com with turning it into a little house with wheels and a nice sunny workspace in the back, where the kids used to sit and wave on their way to school. Get a national parks permit. Paint the side of your bus to tell people what you are working on. Talk to the park rangers and see if they can set you up with an place to park your bus in exchange for giving free classes to children at the park visitors center.

Quite frankly, I left after my masters degree because I saw that academia has a pervasive culture of extraordinary overwork. One of my graduate advisors told me she works 80 hours every week and considered that normal for an academic career. Because there are so many people with PhDs competing for a very limited number of professorships, the only people who have successful academic careers are those willing to work extremely long hours. If you don't absolutely love research, don't destroy yourself doing it.

One thing I would suggest you consider is figuring out what the bare minimum you need to do to get your PhD is and finishing up your degree before leaving for industry. If you have your PhD, your advanced degree will open up doors that will remain open for the rest of your life. You won't be able to continue in academia without a list of strong papers, but that sounds like something you don't want anyway.

Talk to your professors as well both at the community college where you're at but maybe more importantly at the school you end up going to for your bachelors (they may be more likely to have a PhD compared to community colleges where at least by me you can teach with a masters). They can give you a sense of the next steps and what they would advise you to do.

Social Science PhD's (sociology, political science, anthro, history, etc) are generally research and teaching degrees. If you're interested in practicing something (like public health) you can usually do that with a Bachelors and a masters. If you're interested in academia (teaching and research) then most places require a PhD.

The motivation to study and learn is huge for a PhD, once you finish course work you're set free to work on the dissertation, you get guidance along the way and you have a committee and advisor to help guide you but there is much less structure compared to classes and course work. So you have to self motivate to get your stuff done, which works well for some people and not as well for others.

Grad school has high minded conversations for sure but at least in my experience there is a lot of stupid conversations to take minds off the research. While I hate the ""work hard play hard"" statement, in my experience there for grad school it's more ""work smart, play stupid"". I have friends in my program that are into cross fit, triathlons, acting, poetry and writing, knitting, etc. So while research and finishing the degree is the #1 priority you have to unwind some how and for many of us that involves some mindless unrelated task. Also grad school, at least for me, has been weirdly solitary and social at different time. I work on my own research where I'm just plugging away by myself on my own work but I'm also on two other projects where I'm collaborating with people. You'll find link minded people, academia attracts a unique bunch, which is nice to find a community. I worked for a bit before coming to grad school and I really enjoy my work environment now much more. I'm around like minded people who enjoy similar topics and while we may not do the same research we can get together and discuss what we're working on and bounce ideas off each other.

Fair warning, grad school is hard and rough, and as a result is notorious for being really taxing existing mental illnesses or surfacing them in people. If you take a look through the r/gradschool there are lots of mental health posts in there from students. Just giving you a heads up, it seems like a common theme across disciplines and schools.

Grad school for me was a great choice, I like academia and I fit in there. I like research and teaching so this seems to be the right path for me. I wouldn't be set in stone on anything at this point, but have a rough idea of a plan for sure. Talk to your professors and see what they say, they will know what paths are open to you and what paths make sense given your interests. Bounce ideas off them and see what sticks. I graduated undergrad and went straight into law school which was a disaster and I left after one semester. I talked with my professors (from undergrad) about what I should do and they suggested a PhD program. I probobly should have talked with them about my plans rather than being set in stone that I wanted to go to law school. Grad school is a great option for some people, but that is a personal decision and depends a lot on where you are in your life. Happy to help and let me know if I can be of any other help with things!

dhetvkx,t1_dhdh0wr,,mistixs,t2_n7ux4,"&gt; Where are you at in terms of schooling? Undergrad? High school? Post-College?

Right now I'm finishing up my Associate's at a community college &amp; currently figuring out where I want to go next to get my Bachelor's.

&gt; What area of social science?

sociology and psychology, I suppose.

In fact, my original major at my community college was Sociology, but I changed it to General Curriculum to get a taste of other majors, since I know that sociology majors have among the highest unemployment rates. (When getting a PhD, I wouldn't have that problem, because Social Science PhDs actually have among the *lowest* unemployment rates, even lower than engineering, physical sciences, and computer sciences.)

https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf14310/

I'm planning on getting my Bachelor's in Public Health because that has much higher employability &amp; it has many opportunities which are pretty social-sciencey.

one of the colleges I'm looking at has a major option of Public Health &amp; also has an honors program wherein you'd pick a track in addition to your major, and ""social sciences"" is one of them! I'd get to have my cake and eat it too! Plus the honors program involves research projects, which might give me a preview of whether I'd want to get a PhD!

Hopefully I'll be able to get in. I currently have a 3.9 GPA, not because I'm particularly smart (even though my professors &amp; academic counselors insist that I am very smart, I actually have an IQ on the *lower* end of average, though to be fair I score ""very superior"" in terms of verbal/writing abilities) but I really do love school, at least when it comes to the stuff I'm interested in. (...is that a good sign when it comes to possibly pursuing a PhD?)

specific things I'm interested in involve women and women's experiences and women's health.

I also have side-interests in mental health, &amp; spirituality and religions of all kinds and their effects, both positive and negative. it's ironic since i'm not religious or spiritual myself. from my research, i see that spirituality has many positive effects, but i have so little motivation to partake in it (despite enjoying reading about it).

i don't have much motivation to do *anything* except schoolwork &amp; ""reading about random shit on the internet"" (as my mom puts it). i literally spend most of my school-breaks laying in bed all day, sometimes on the laptop reading, or otherwise just laying there or sleeping (sleeping sometimes for up to 30 hours). (yes i've been diagnosed mentally ill)

maybe grad school would be good for me socially since i assume many other people would be interested in deep thoughtful philosophical conversations like i am. i've always been a loner. i don't even talk to my family much because we don't enjoy the same type of talk. as i said, i like long deep thoughtful philosophical conversations, which my family *can't stand*.

i've been thinking about how being such a loner isn't really healthy - what's gonna happen when my family dies, and i can no longer rely on them for any help and support? it'd be healthier to maintain good relationships with people so that we can help and support each other. 

maybe grad school would provide more opportunities to meet and talk to people who enjoy talking about the same things that i do. of course many of them may be wrapped up in research, so we may not be able to talk as much, but that'd actually be *good* for me since i need a lot of alone-time to recharge anyway. quality over quantity, for me. and i think grad school might provide that.",1,2017-05-11 07:05:43

dn68m52,t3_70vhn9,,Dcmcm,,"Yes, academia is fucked up. 

But we have to work within it if we want to be academics. Burnout is something you have to take seriously, continual stress doesn't make your life or your work better. Take a week off (I would suggest more, but the thought of that might be even more stressful). 

Meet up with your other three authors on this paper and share a bottle of wine or three while speculating on the different animals' DNA that may have made it into reviewer 2's bloodline over the generations - and then choose another deadline and agree to work on the paper together.   

Other suggestions:

Find some people to write with. Doing it alone sucks. You have already got a group of 3 others you are working on a paper with, and you are in a lab with other students and researchers - use them and let them use you. Suggest a writers workshop every few months where people can bring unfinished and rejected manuscripts and get feedback on them (make it a rule to start with positive comments and don't allow negative without suggestions to fix it). 


Getting papers rejected sucks, but you have to learn to offload some of the blame to the random number generator that determines what AC your paper gets assigned to, and how that determines what reviewers they will know to call on, and the chances that 1/2 of them will be too busy and say no so they will have to find other people based almost entirely on matching the keywords from your abstract to other people's papers or online profiles. 

You also have to not read harshness or personal criticisms into the reviews (which is difficult, I know), and work on translating the points into what you have to do to get the paper accepted somewhere else:

You don’t explain what other people are doing and why what you do is better --&gt; The contribution (for this audience) isn't clear and up front. Explain it more simply, in more general terms, in the introduction and conclusion. 

There are ways to improve the stuff, you don’t take everything into consideration --&gt; Again this goes back to the contribution. When people say things like this it often means that you haven't made crystal clear what this incremental step towards the goal actually gives the community. Be very clear about what you have and haven't done, what the goal is for the work in this paper and how this fits in relationship to the larger goals of the field. 

You don’t have enough use-cases and experiments --&gt; Unless this is backed up with actual numbers (X isn't enough to show significance because of A, B, and C) then this also goes to the last point, if the reviewer thinks you are making a bigger point than your results and experiments support then they will tell you that you need more results and experiments to make it - they don't know your work or data like you do, so it is very difficult to concretely suggest narrowing the focus to what is presentable from the work already done. 

Finally, don't think it is deceiving anyone to give up, or take an extended break for your own mental health. You should be able to negotiate to stop the clock for 6 months and go pick veggies in New Zealand or something.

dup14sp,t3_7zlnb7,,NoxiousQuadrumvirate,t2_kywisro,"Let me give you the perspective of one of the students you think so little of: me. 

I'm diagnosed with schizophrenia and ADHD. My symptoms were diagnosed well before I started university, and I take responsibility for my disabilities. I attend regular counselling and plan as much of my work as possible so that the interference of those disabilities is minimised. 

I got extra time and a separate testing centre for all of my exams because I needed the assistance to focus. When doing homework, or now when working on my own research, I can retreat to my office or my home and work to my strengths. If I'm having a tough hour, I can do other less taxing work for a bit and come back to the hard stuff when I feel more up to it. But standard exams don't allow that. I'd be forced to do (what was at the time) incredibly difficult and demanding work whilst surrounded by an absolute cacophony of noise and movement, and with no reprieve for when that undoubtedly gets to be too much. I'd panic and be unable to follow a train of thought. My mind got clouded and I'd lose the ability to read. I would have failed. And that failure would not have actually represented any data point of value, because not even in research am I judged under exam conditions. There is no job in existence that would judge under those conditions. I was being tested on what I knew, not how well I could perform under arbitrary circumstances.

And I was never a bad student. I consistently got A+s in all internal assessments and labs, and with the accommodations made to my exams, I got A+s in those too. 

I graduated from 2 majors in 3 years with a cumulative 4.0. I handed in all work on time and attended my classes. I did research throughout and published my first first-author publication as a freshman. I did outreach work, taught introductory classes, and gave lectures over that time as an undergraduate as well. Would you dare try to argue that I was a poor student? Or that I was ""delicate""? 

And I'm not the only one either. I know a number of people who had different disabilities but similar achievements. Disability doesn't mean ""less intelligent"". It means that there are certain things you find it harder to do.

Part of the reason why you think students with disabilities must be bad students is because struggling is often a pre-requisite for diagnosis. Plus, the stigma for mental health is very strong, which you are actively contributing to right now. I never struggled academically but psychosis is hard to ignore in any case. Someone whose ADHD causes them to get a B when they should have gotten an A is possibly going to go undiagnosed. In reality, quite a few of your good students may be doing well *in spite of* disability, but that just means that your tests are not accurately measuring what they know and can do.

[When roughly 20% of the population has a mental health issue](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml), it's not that far-fetched to see 1/6 of your class experiencing some kind of mental illness.

dup0mzg,t3_7zlnb7,,KaesekopfNW,t2_rj6pd,"&gt; Interestingly enough, none of the strongest students ever seem to suffer from mental disabilities anyway.

I find this to be an odd comment, given that academia is rife with mental illness. The whole process of the pursuit of a degree, which gets worse the higher you go, often destroys people's mental health. The constant stress, the advisor abuse, the low pay and high workload for grad students - all of these can ruin a person. When you factor in exogenous stressors, like a person's work life outside of classes, or financial strain, or strain with friends, family, or a partner, or the death of loved ones, or any kind of traumatic experience, mental health can be destroyed even further.

So that said, I guarantee you that a good portion of your strongest students were very much suffering from mental illness in some way. The problem with your view, it seems, is that you refuse to acknowledge mental illness as a problem equivalent to a physical disability. Just because someone doesn't ""look"" the part, doesn't mean he or she isn't suffering internally.

And quite honestly, given your dismissive attitude and the fact that you refuse to help these students who are open about their struggles indicates to me that students who have mental illnesses probably would never feel comfortable opening up to you in the first place.

Academics don't like to talk about this kind of stuff so I think that everyone walks around feeling like they are the only one struggling. So thank you for being so open about it, I really appreciate it.

I'd say it really depends, and it might be a case of trial and error. As in, you may not know if you can handle it until you're doing it. 

Scenario 1 - your personal connection gives you extra motivation and insight into your work. Your passion could amplify your work. Possibly the type of work would be abstract enough that you aren't confronted with the _worst_ aspects of Alzheimer's daily. It's not just a job in the 9 to 5 sense because you know what is at stake and you see the larger picture of how your perhaps sometimes mundane 9 to 5 work contributes to the greater good. For at least someone's grandparents if not yours. 

Scenario 2 - it does take a toll emotionally and your wellbeing suffers. Maybe it makes you more aware of the painful aspects, or maybe it's not that you're more aware just that it's constantly in your consciousness and you have a harder time being objective or concentrating. 

One of the key factors to helping you have more of a Scenario 1 experience might be ""self care"" which is a common thing that professionals who work in draining or difficult settings do to protect their mental health.

In the US, many issues are complicated because there are usually state and federal laws pertaining to a topic. There is a difference between public and private schools at the federal level for K-12 education (primary and secondary schools, to age 18) - in that, generally, public schools have to abide by certain rules, including mental health accommodations, while private schools do not. Many private primary/secondary schools do *not* provide accommodations like extra time on tests, at least in my state. But for nation-wide standard tests, like the SAT, then accommodations can be granted for the test regardless of public or private school.

You're talking about university though, and I'm betting that in the US there is a similar divide between public and private schools, but I'm not sure. It could also vary by state whether accommodations are legally ""guaranteed"". If there is a private school somewhere that did not provide accommodations, there may not be a disability office at all, or at least not one that is in tune to mental health accommodations. Most universities, regardless, do have some sort of student service that provides accommodations, but that can be more for things like hard of hearing, or access for physical disabilities. For mental health at university, it's more on a case-by-case basis whether a given student would get extra time for a given class at a given university. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, sure does, but it's not as ""required"" at this level practically-speaking, at least in my experience.

But based of my personal experience, and what I've directly seen for myself with other students and postdocs, there are a few factors  that are more prevalent in academia as opposed to other jobs that, when combined, are likely to lead to mental health issues.

I can think of 3 main factors at the moment:


1) Increased workloads. Fairly obvious one - publish or perish. But even if you dont want an academic career, if you're planning on moving on after your PhD or postdoc into other areas of work, this increased workload can still very much affect you. I would also like to add that work never finishes at work, as with our department particularly, all the lab work should be done at work and all the reading and writing at home or weekends. Receiving e-mails at unsociable hours is also the norm. 


2) PIs. These people dont rise to their positions because of their fantastic managerial skills, they're there because they published lots and/or networked with the right people.  In my case, my personal PI and many other PIs in my department (there are a few genuine gems but they're jumping ship) are horrible people to put it simply. 


3) Perfectionism. Being surrounded by other smart people can affect you. Working hard and getting no decent results, while others are getting a lot of results can affect you.

cg37cmc,t3_20g135,,SnowblindAlbino,t2_7ild5,"History of medicine and mental health are in some ways hot fields, in that there is interesting scholarship being done and interest from publishers. That said, they are also tough markets for faculty jobs because there are very few teaching colleges that will ever hire in those subfields...if you only have 5-6 faculty in your history department you'll likely have 2-3 Americanists tops. In that situations it's likely you'd hire one colonial, one 19th c., and one 20th c. person. Are you going to hire a history of medicine person as your single 20th c. Americanist? Probably not.

Given that reality, such a specialty thus makes a tough job search even tougher, as you'd be restricted to a subset of a subset of the market, i.e. the few jobs likely to pop up in more research-oriented or larger teaching institutions that would have the breadth to make room for a history of medicine type.  To avoid that, you'd really want to have a parallel specialty in something that is much more marketable, like gender or race, and then use the medicine piece as a secondary field.

Take a look at the H-Net job listings for the last few years, or the Chronicle listings, for history of medicine. You'll find there aren't a whole lot, which is one reason there aren't a whole lots of Ph.D.s being produced in those fields (relative to more common ones at least) unless they are clearly developing multiple areas of expertise for the market.

(I say this as someone who has advocated hiring an historian of medicine for the last many years, only to have my colleagues collectively argue that we cannot ""waste"" a hire on such an esoteric specialty...the last hire was a Civil War historian instead. While that *could* have been someone who did history of medicine as well, the pool of 175+ candidates did not include a single such applicant.)",2,2014-03-15 13:50:42

I'm not sure how useful this might be, but there was a reddit post floating around a while back about [this](https://www.gwern.net/docs/math/1990-thomason.pdf) paper. I've quoted the relevant part below.


&gt;The  first  author  must  state  that  his  coauthor  and  close  friend,   Tom   Trobaugh,  quite  intelligent,  singularly  original,  and  inordinately   generous, killed  himself  consequent  to endogenous  depression.  Ninety-four  days  later,  in  my  dream,  Tom's  simulacrum  remarked,  ""The  direct  limit  characterization   of  perfect   complexes  shows  that   they  extend,  just   as  one  extends  a  coherent  sheaf.""   Awaking  with  a  start,  I  knew  this  idea  had  to  be  wrong,  since  some  perfect  complexes  have  a  non-vanishing  KQ obstruction  to  extension.   I  had  worked  on  this  problem  for  3  years,  and saw  this  approach  to  be  hopeless.   But  Tom's  simulacrum  had  been  so  insistent,  I  knew  he wouldn't  let  me  sleep  undisturbed  until  I had  worked  out  the  argument  and  could  point  to  the  gap.  This  work  quickly  led  to  the  key  results  of  this  paper.   To  Tom,  I  could  have  explained  why  he  must  be  listed  as  a  coauthor.   During  his  lifetime,  Tom  also  pointed  out  the  interesting  comparison  of  the  careers  of  Grothendieck  and  Newton.",1,2020-12-07 19:23:25

fn088dd,t3_fyfms4,True,SnowblindAlbino,t2_7ild5,"People don't seem to be grasping the reality of the situation. The odds are high that a large number of US colleges/university will *close forever* as a result of COVID-19 if fall enrollments are impacted. The revenue hit from spring alone (lost income and refunded housing/board fees) has created large deficits at many schools. Two weeks ago Inside Higher Ed reported that there are hundreds of schools with insufficient liquid reserves to cover more than 2-3 months of operating expenses. That's one semester. 

Public schools like AZ will fare differently, but remember what happened in 2008-2010. Conservative legislators slashed higher ed budgets and never replaced them. That shifted cost burdens onto students and required cuts that were never restored, including shifting many faculty lines from TT to contingent labor. Taking on new graduate students or pledging to fund them for multiple years would be irresponsible in this environment for all but the handful of elite schools that are essentially self-funding via endowment and grant incomes.

These graduate departments at Arizona may not even *be* there in five years, and the faculty teaching in them could well be laid off this fall. By telling students this up front they are doing the right thing. It's an unprecedented crisis-- nothing like this has happened in the US since the Great Depression --and this black swan moment will never be reversed by a WWII-scale spending spree, a GI Bill, a Baby Boom, or even a general agreement that investing in higher education is good for the country. Instead there will be massive cuts, contractions, and closures at all but the most elite schools. Higher ed will look very different in five years. The only thing worse than *starting* a Ph.D. right now is probably having the terrible luck to be *finishing* one in what may well become the worse academic market in a century.",2,2020-04-10 16:46:43
fmv806i,t3_fx9z4l,True,SnowblindAlbino,t2_7ild5,"My setting is pretty much like OP's; I'm at a moderately SLAC where the price tag is about 1.5x the median household income for the US. I'm also a department chair, so have some insight into what my colleagues are doing.

Our response to the sudden shift online has been, generally, to try to maintain the *content* we would have otherwise delivered, but to significantly reduce expectations.    We lost two full weeks of instruction in the turmoil, so that had an unavoidable impact. It's also true, of course, that exactly zero of our faculty had any experience with online education so we're frankly not very good at it even though teaching is by far our #1 criterion for hiring and promotion.

So personally, I have dropped a few assignments that simply wouldn't have worked online. I've also dropped a bit of content due to the lost weeks of instruction. I've made some of the readings ""optional"" now and dropped reflections/discussion related to those. But perhaps most importantly, I have indeed relaxed my expectations of my students. I'm presenting due dates as being flexible, for example. I'm recognizing that students no longer have access to the physical library-- a problem because two of my classes were in the midst to research papers.  I've replaced what were planned as significant oral presentations with simpler recorded ones. And yes, I'm grading quite a bit more leniently than ever before in my 25+ years of teaching.

The reality is that even in my school where most (not all, but most) students are privileged some are struggling with the changes. A few still don't have reliable internet at home; others are living in homes with multiple siblings. At least two I know are now working in health care because they lost their on-campus jobs; one is working nights at a nursing home. In once case the student's family sold their home last fall and moved many states away and into a much smaller home, so there's not even a bedroom for her. More than one student has a family member with COVID-19 and I now know two who have lost extended family members to the disease. Others are struggling with fear, anxiety, and/or depression in the face of this unprecedented disruption.

So while some students are doing just fine and probably have enough time on their hands to do some extra work, many do not. I've instructed my faculty to be considerate in their expectations, to relax deadlines, and to feel free to cut back on assignments as they deem necessary. Most importantly, I've urged them to work with their students and above all use to be flexible given the varied circumstances. On Monday I spent almost two hours talking with one student who is struggling with the transition. I can do that because I'm teaching only about 45 students this semester-- for those of us at small, expensive colleges that one-on-one attention is about the only benefit they are still getting for their money.

Our faculty also voted to make pass/fail an option for all students in all courses right up to finals week. So those who want grades can have them, and any who don't feel up to it are only going to be held to the ""pass"" standard.",1,2020-04-09 05:02:43

Then, once you've gotten yourself into a more functional place, you can apply for places with a personal statement that explains how you managed to publish several papers while dealing with XYZ demons, and now that you've managed to overcome those issues, you are able to focus. 

Simultaneously, reach out to any contacts in academia you have who may be willing to help you.

frlfll9,t3_gpe2op,True,gust_wave,t2_4apnbtqh,"Hi, I have been dealing with bipolar 1 symptoms since I was 14 (mania, psychosis, and depression), and got my diagnosis when I was 18 after years of doctor's notes and reviews. I also struggle with post-traumatic stress from childhood sexual abuse. I'm also preparing to defend my MSc proposal to my committee, and I plan to continue with a PhD afterwards. I want to tell you, it's really hard sometimes. **But if you are passionate about what you're studying/researching when you aren't manic, (and that's the important bit), you can most likely figure something out.**

My advice: 

* Take your meds, if you don't have them, start convos with doctors. If you have them, and they aren't working for you, start convos with doctors. If you have them, and they are working for you, continue convos with your doctors. Adjustment is fine and good.
* Get enough sleep, and never sacrifice sleep for school. I stayed up past midnight working on school exactly 5 times during my undergrad, and I graduated with distinction. It's possible, and it wards off the depression and regulates the mania (win win) 
* Get in contact with your school's centre for student's with disabilities. Get the accommodations you need in order, so you can activate them when shit hits the fan. 
   * Set boundaries with everyone in your life. Everyone. Family, friends, supervisors at work, supervisors at school. No one is entitled to push you past your capacity to maintain your health and wellbeing. 
   * On a related note, get a good relationship with a doctor or counsellor. 
* Find out your triggers, and avoid them. Also, find out your coping mechanisms, and make use of them. If your coping mechanisms (legitimately) include substances, *watch out for troublesome and addictive behaviours*. Obviously alcohol and weed (or harder drugs), but it could also be about coffee. Have you ever seen students come out of caffeine withdrawals?  Watch out for that with *all* substances, and seek help if you need it.
* On a similar note to coping mechanisms, look at the [wellness wheel](https://www.clarion.edu/student-life/health-fitness-and-wellness/office-of-health-promotions/wellness-wheel.html). Find out what makes you happy and what makes you sad in all seven dimensions (emotional, intellectual, physical, social, environmental, financial, and spiritual), and make that the foundation of your life. Anything that threatens that foundation, deal with. 
* During your low points, you may get nothing done. That's fine. You can deal with the consequences when the darkness passes. But you gotta be alive to do that. So do what you gotta do to keep yourself alive. 
* I still struggle with this, but if you feel suicidal, reach out immediately. Suicidal ideation fucking sucks, and spending weeks catatonic will not help. Spending days talking to professionals or people who care about you will. 

I want to make it clear that, like everything, dealing with bipolar isn't a linear process. There will be set backs, there will be times when you go ""oh fuck"" and need to take a step back. That's fine. Your health is your foundation. If you don't have good health, you won't be a good student or researcher. So work with the people around you to make sure you can safeguard your health.",5,2020-05-23 23:14:47

I could tell we both struggled at lot at the beginning and over summer, being cutoff from the workplace where we really enjoyed being. I kept with it because I figured once they were relieved of childcare duties, they would be eager to return.

When I sit down to work and feel crippled by anxiety, I take a few deep breaths and then whip out a notepad. (I even put some consideration into what forms of note-taking make me the most comfortable, and I try to keep those handy.)

I channel my anxiety into writing down every task that I think I need to complete. I try to break them down into as small of units as possible. Once I have exhausted all of the little things that come to my mind, I reflect on the whole list. I take another deep breath.

At this point, I usually feel like the list is huge, but clearly *finite*, where my anxiety-induced conception of things previously had me feeling like the task list went on *forever*. This is a small win. I take a deep breath.

I spend a little bit of time reading through my list. I try to rank all of the tasks by urgency (or general importance, if urgency isn't the most relevant limiting factor) via colored highlighters (with a legend!) or numbers or whatever makes the most sense at the time. I take a deep breath.

I look over the list of highest ranked tasks. I decide which one I want to tackle *today*. I take a deep breath, and I take a stab at the task.

After a while, I inevitably get distracted (or discouraged) from that task. I take a deep breath, and I look back at my list. I ask myself which of the lower-ranked tasks sounds the most interesting *right now*. I pick one. I take a deep breath and I try to work on that task.

Wash, rinse, and repeat. I just try to make sure that I always circle back to higher priority tasks between every one or two lower priority tasks.

I hope this helps. Good luck in your studies!",1,2020-08-09 04:32:08

givvahw,t1_givpowo,True,leSchaf,t2_11oo41,"Okay, so you are just reading through a bunch of papers because you're interested in the topic.

A PhD thesis requires you to compile your own findings to answer a novel question relevant to your field. In STEM, most PhD Student do their own experiments that provide data from which they draw the insights to answer their research question. You do new experiments because typically the data to answer the relevant research questions of the field doesn't exist yet. This still requires you to read a ton and you will cite lots papers in your thesis because the literature informs your experimental design and the Interpretation of your data. In the humanities, the relevant data is often hidden within literature. Your job then is to find the relevant information which often requires you to read between the lines, compile that and draw new conclusions.

For a PhD thesis in neuroscience, it wouldn't be enough to read literature and then write about e.g. which transmitters have been found to be involved in depression because you haven't provide new findings, you have just compile existing findings in one place.

Perhaps you yould do a meta-analysis of existing studies. For example, the importance of neurotransmitter A in depression is really controversial in the field, there are a number of studies with contradictory conclusions. You could then analyze all those studies, find measure the objectively compare them, do some statistics.

You would probably need to initiate the project because these types of theses are so rare. You would need to have a really promising topic for that. As someone who doesn't have a PhD in the field yet, it can be very hard to identify such a topic. You would need to reach out to professors the field. If you already have some connections from your master's where you already worked with professors that would be very helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

\- What you described is the textbook definition of imposter syndrome. It turns out that almost everyone experiences it in academia to some degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- It sounds like your self-esteem is very low at the moment potentially due to depression. It is feeding into your imposter syndrome and making it all the more difficult. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- In academia progress is very slow, the returns are low and positive reinforcement is far and few in between. This is hard for almost everyone, and some people cope by leaning on validation from their peers by trying to appear smarter, more confident, more apt etc. A lot of them might be struggling as well but putting on a front. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Talking to your peers openly is often the most relieving thing. If there are people you trust among your peers, you should try sharing this, you might be surprised to hear how often people respond by ""oh man, I feel you, I have been struggling so much this past month"".

&amp;#x200B;

\-You should go to therapy and to a doctor for your depression. Self-care and your well being are the most important. If you start feeling better, you might find that this whole academia thing feels a bit smoother. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Academia is not end all be all of human endeavor despite what people in academia might believe. If at any point you decide that it doesn't make you into the person you would like to live your life as then move into something else without guilt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Academia is like everything, sometimes its toxic and sometimes it isn't. I'm only a grad student myself, but I think I helped myself tremendously by picking a good PI. He doesn't rely on grad student labor. He has a full time employee and several undergrads for that, I'm supposed to help when I have time, and if I don't have time because of something else... I don't help. He made that clear because I was trying to do both at one time. That helps, A TON.

To me the lab is like home. We are all friends, we are all aware of each others lives. When I am other places, a conference for example. Thats when I feel the toxicity of academia more.

f333qft,t3_dfbksp,True,guynamedgrandma,t2_aa3hu,"I hope I can add some perspective as someone who is about a decade ahead of you.

1. You are not alone in these feelings.  I struggle with burnout (from job-related anxiety and depression) and imposter syndrome.  The demands are high and the amount of criticism and rejection in science is ridiculous. But, having those thoughts and receiving criticism on your work does not mean you aren't capable, and they aren't criticizing YOU.  Behind close doors, all of my friends in the field admit that this is hard and they don't know exactly what they are doing.

2. Every study has its flaws, especially at the PhD level.  By the time I get a paper published, I'm usually not that excited by it because I intimately know everything wrong with it!  I've had grant applications just trashed, and that feeling sucks. But, those flaws are things I can begin to address with the next study or application. You don't have to have an impactful dissertation project.  Really, you're demonstrating that you have some form of applicable skills and perseverance.  Don't discount the problem solving you've had to do to get where you are.  Take it on with a ""growth mindset"" that the process makes you wiser, regardless if the dissertation is deemed a success or not.  This is, admittedly, tough to do.

3. Try not to compare yourself to others.  Everyone has different backgrounds, different circumstances, different health concerns, different mentorship, different resources, different strengths, different weaknesses, different forms of curiosity/passion.  You're not an idiot just because you have the shortest CV in the room.  It may just be that you're in a well-respected room.  It's ok to not want to be the ""rock star"" of your field.

4.  Even if you ""fail"" in epic fashion (not finishing or failing the dissertation), you have a LONG WAY TO FALL BEFORE YOU HIT ROCK BOTTOM.  Yes, debt is stressful, but you can work through it with time and planning.  Yes the effort of the last few years may seem wasted (sunk cost fallacy), but you have developed skills that other employers will value.  It seems that you are doing translational work in and advanced field.  This has value.

5.  Your brain is trying to protect you from a perceived threat, giving you the flight-or-fight stress response.  This made sense when we were threatened by dinosaurs (full disclosure: I'm not an evolutionary scientist or historian or neuroscientist), but it's a little bit of an overreaction (that we can't control easily) when we are threatened by deadlines and peer-review.  

6.  You have a girlfriend that you want to marry.  You are killing it at what matters in life.  Well done!

1. A lot of scientific discoveries are made by people who have suffered from depression.  There’s an evolutionary argument that depression suppresses certain cognitive distortions and helps people see/observe more effectively. 

2. Depression also CREATES cognitive distortions. You need to treat yours — you won’t lose anything by doing that — because it is giving you a destructive all-or-nothing tunnel vision and preventing you from seeing certain realities. 

The thing is, we live in a youth-obsessed culture that loves pyrotechnics and worships individual achievement. Please consider how the teachers of many of these people felt when they transformed the world, and the gratitude many of them felt to their teachers.  

A lot of geniuses — Gauss has a famous one —have biographies that include idiot teachers failing to recognize or even dismissing their gifts.  Valuing the fact that academia puts you in a position to help nurture others to achievement is a way to expand your own scope of influence and the possibilities for a meaningful life.

On the one hand, my heart and gut say, they're idiots, ignore them, pursue your dream, get that PhD!

But my experience retorts.... wait a second. 

Here's the thing.  What is your *goal* for the PhD? 

Is it to get the PhD?  In which case, full speed ahead.  Go get 'em. 

Or iIs it to get the tenure-track job at the R1 University?  In which case...   They have a point.

In most fields (certainly my humanities field, but also many, many science fields) competition is fierce.  What does this actually mean?  This means that for my TT job (the one I ended up with) there were (I found out later) 295 applicants.  Let that sink in.  I was up against 5 PhDs from Harvard, 5 from Yale, 3 from Columbia, etc. etc.   It is a fucking miracle I ended up with my job.  

I'm on a search committee right now, and for a fairly narrow field, we got 125 applicants.   Now, 60 of those right away were significantly weaker--immediate toss-outs.  But we ended up with 30 to 40 really, really top candidates.  Like, 40 candidates who on paper (by recommendations, publications, grants, etc.) were all fucking amazing.  

What do you do?  You start looking for weakness.   Seriously, that's the ONLY thing you can do.   You start reading 30 great dissertations--ingenious topics, strong research--but you can only talk to 14 of them for the first round interviews.  What do you *do*??!!!  Your eye starts looking for imperfections.  It's only human. 

So, you have 10 candidates who have 3 rec letters (each) who all write, ""this is the best student I've ever had.""  Then, you get to the candidate of whom they write, ""this candidate is exceptional--particularly in the way how she overcame her severe depression to accomplish so much.""  Now, we can all SAY to each other (and to ourselves) that we support people facing challenges...  but the reality is, when reading 20 ""perfect"" applications, and one that says ""very good--overcame X handicap""...  that one that says ""overcame X handicap"" i just not going to get the job. 

So, when one of your colleagues says, ""There's no place for weakness"" in their department, they are both being a total clueless asshole *and* perhaps trying to get across something important:

If you're applying for jobs, and your letters all say, ""Candidate x is great, he/she overcame the severe handicap of epilepsy to finish a fantastic PhD"", while all your competitors letters say, ""Candidate y is simply the best in field, full stop.""... well, you're NOT going to beat out candidate y for a job.  That is the cold, hard facts. 

Does this mean that people with epilepsy can't pursue PhDs??  NO.  Absolutely not.  But it DOES mean:   you *cannot* let this become a characteristic that makes it into your rec letter.  If you want to be competitive in a brutal job market, you HAVE to have your recommenders say, ""this person is amazing"", NOT ""this person is amazing because they accomplished so much despite having severe epilepsy.""  

So, others will downvote this... but I'm taking the time to write it out to be helpful, and not bullshit you with p.c. platitudes.   (and if we were having this conversation face-to-face, I would not be saying this...!)  

Yes,  You can indeed do very well, and thrive in a PhD program.!  

But:   if you're in-and-out-of-hospital constantly, that *does* affect your work.  If all of our colleagues and supervisors know you have epilepsy enough to comment on it--well, that means it's probably going to wind up in your letters.   And if it affects your work, and/or winds up in your letters, it's going to hurt on the job market.    That is the reality. 

(That's why I'm so frustrated by my undergrads who ask for/sign up for ""accommodations"" for a whole range of disabilities--getting extra time on exams, etc. etc-- and then ask me for letters recommending them to top grad programs at Harvard or Yale.  It's the same problem.  If you want to be ""competitive"" at the very highest level, you absolutely cannot ""show weakness"" and remain competitive...  That is brutally unfair fact of life.

I wouldn't necessarily recommend this, but I actually started my PhD because I was depressed. I fell into a big hole after my masters, became quite suicidal, got myself into therapy, but things weren't really shifting for me because I felt like I was just treading water professionally and I didn't have a sense of purpose. I thought the PhD might give me that, and about halfway through my data collection things started to come right for me with the depression. I still suffered from anxiety, but I had found the things that help me to thrive: structure, community, purpose, quest for knowledge, enormous personal and professional growth, feeling valued and like I had something I could contribute. It was incredibly challenging and I spent the whole time thinking I was barely adequate as a PhD student (it turned out I wasn't - I was very successful, which caused a whole other issue with imposter syndrome). I was successful because I was tenacious, persistent, worked very hard, and learnt how to figure my way out of stuckness. I think these things were more important than having natural genius.

I don't think this would work for everyone, and it also depends on the discipline, nature of the program, funding, department culture, quality and supportiveness of advisors, etc. I'm a post-doc now and I still don't know what the future holds.

ebp808a,t3_a5dddr,True,TomWinter567,t2_d9yxvur,"I could have written your post at one point in my life. Many of us are attracted to academia because of the flexibility and freedom of the work environment, but the lack of structure in our work isn't psychologically good for some of us. I used to spend enormous amounts of time ""at work"" on campus, but I spent way too much of it procrastinating and socializing and I would have relatively little to show for the amount of time I put in, and then there would be marathon sessions of work before every deadline and a huge crash afterwards. It was a road to depression, unhappiness, and failure to live up to my potential. 

It took me years to figure out my problem, and I'm still working on it, but my happiness and satisfaction improved tremendously once I started imposing more structure on my work time. I get up and arrive at the office at the same time every weekday and I use an app that syncs between my computer and phone to keep track of my time at work with the goal of doing 6-9 hours of productive work each day, a minimum of 40 hours of productive work each week, and a maximum of 50 hours of work each week. (You need a minimum and a maximum because you will crash and be unproductive if you work too much. You also have to be honest and only give yourself credit for time when you mostly focused on work.) I try to do no work on Saturdays so that there is one day of proper relaxation in each week, though that isn't always possible. I started bringing a lunch from home and I limit going out for lunch or coffee with colleagues to once or twice per month. Once I started tracking my work hours carefully, I realized lunch and coffee socializing were huge time drains. I also keep a calendar in which I track my ""work days"" and ""days off"" during university breaks. It's too easy to waste your breaks sort of working every day, but not really working all that much and when the break is over you don't feel like you've accomplished very much and you don't like you really took time off. I'm much happier at the end when I plan out full days of work and full days off for breaks.  ",3,2018-12-13 14:59:03

I understand from my fellow PhD student that you aren't sure about my productivity in this environment.  So, I have switched advisors.  Thank you for your help and support so far along the way!""

However, are you suggesting that you would switch advisors, but still remain funded on the old advisor's project?  I would not do that.  Definitely not.  This would be unusual in my field and I think it's inadvisable anywhere.

Whether this is good or bad for a new professor's career is not your primary concern (honestly, it's probably a little bit of both).  And whether he's angry or not is also not your concern.

What does worry me a little bit though is the substantial amount of anxiety that shines through your post, and I'd point out that this is not healthy going forward.  Keep in mind that nobody is ""out to get you"", and that your success is their success, normally, in an academic environment.  People don't get to ascend to a tenure-track position if they are as overcome by anger or jealousy as you seem to project onto them.  You might benefit from seeking some counseling in that matter -- academia can be a pressure-cooker and I've seen it breed anxiety, depression and other unproductive thought patterns.

1. Your thesis does not have to be perfect. It only has to be good. So aim for that.
2. Having a clear structure for the thesis is important. Know what topics/materials/results to include and what you want to highlight. This is something you can talk about with your supervisor
3. Take breaks. This is often underestimated. There are times in the day when your mind is tired or occupied with other things. Go out, take long walks and let your brain run free so that when you come back to the office your mind is refreshed and focussed when you get back to writing. And stay off the internet! During your breaks you do not want any more mental input!
4. Enjoy writing! I understand that you are going through some difficult times at the moment, but please try to remember why you signed up for your field of study back in the day. There is something you love about the field and you are now able to express your love by writing your thesis. Write about the things that fascinate you and write about how your research fits into the bigger picture! Use the discussion part of your thesis to delve deeper into those results that are the most interesting.
5. Be consistent. Write every day. Including weekends. For at least one hour every day. On bad days, it will be exactly one hour. On very good days you might make 5 hours. Write down starting and end times so that you know for sure how much time you've spent.
6. Writing is actually several processes: Note-taking/Brainstorming, writing and editing. Your brain is in different moods at different times and accordingly some of these processes work well at different times. So try to take advantage of that.
   1. Note-taking/Brainstorming happens when you just write down bullet points. Often times these bullet points are TODOs about things you still want to to for your thesis or things that would be nice to have.
   2. writing is writing out your thoughts in long form. This often results in drafts of text. Do not aim for quality. Just make sure that the things you want to say are being said in the text.
   3. Editing. You improve the writing from step 6.2. so that you get a text of good quality.
7. Look after yourself! Make sure your body and mind get what they really need. I know that this is easier said than done, but it is very tempting to just grind your way through. Try to give yourself better conditions and it will probably make the whole thing easier.

As for the depression/anxiety: Make sure you have someone who can support you emotionally in the meantime. At least someone you can reach out to and talk to every day. It should not be your supervisor. It can be on the phone or via chat. Just have someone else so that you are not going through this alone.

dil0t23,t3_6fq2vj,,amutualravishment,t2_31qfxol,"You sound like a fish on dry land.  Depression is just a side effect of greater troubles in your life. So you can't exactly offer your family depression as a explanation for your actions.  Whether or not they believe you have depression is irrelevant because it doesn't address the problem. What you have going on can't be diagnosed as a psychiatric disorder, though you could be diagnosed with one, two or more.. You would just be labeling behavior near arbitrarily in doing so, which is fine if it leads to peace of mind, your credibility, but most importantly medication which can help treat the overarching problem. But check this out.  To one person your behavior may be depression and to another it may be slacking off.  Guess what? The symptoms of each are the same. Objectively speaking, you are both depressed and a slacker.  Mind blowing right? But your the depression isn't coming out of nowhere; there are bigger problems in your life. So let's recap so far.

""I want to argue that my sharp drop in grades/motivation is due to depression/sleep disorder""
This doesn't tell the whole story, it doesn't really hold up. It's just a list of symptoms. What it just really says is: My depression, My sleep disorder, My loss of motivation, My drop in grades. You could also say My drug addiction. Maybe the people in your life should see one thing on that list and understand the whole picture, but they don't.

Now: ""is the result of repressed issues""
This does tell the whole story, kind of.  It's vague. What you really need (or not) is your friends and family to believe you have repressed issues. You are dealing with emotional trauma which is inescapably more consuming than academic priorities. If you face it head on you can say this is the source of your low grades AND low motivation AND depression AND sleep issues, otherwise yeah justifying low grades with ""depression"" just sounds like a cop out, especially when you're using drugs.

You're not directly asking for it, but the cure to your ailment is to make sure you eat enough(#1), exercise (cardio) like someone else mentioned), be social (limiting your drinking would go a long way), see your doctor and therapist regularly.  Go to class (sit in the first 2-3 rows, please). You do want to kill it in your final year, after all. You need to have some semblance of a schedule.. Something like you need to go to bed before 11pm and you must get ~8+ hours of sleep each night.

How to address your credibility? Stop smoking weed completely (in my opinion you have to do this otherwise you're going to continue to spend your time in your room) and kill it next academic year. Just let people see you are thriving (Behaviours speak louder than words, the other person said). If peers pressure you for an explanation, be casual and tell them you were having problems with smoking dope, or you know, you just couldn't get into the material (which is true!) and you're over that stuff now because you love the feeling of success. If you are talking to a prof, you can just say you were grappling with some personal issues and oh yeah, you're lecture was great, see you next time! (And then show up and get good grades)  So yeah, to go along with the analogy I began with: Grow legs.",3,2017-06-07 16:10:34
diklks1,t3_6fq2vj,,mrgumble,t2_dwtep,"If you want a third, objective statement of you having a depression, go see a doctor and get treatment. Without a proper diagnosis, you will only appear to others as 'feeling depressed', to which the usual (unhelpful) advice is to 'pull yourself together' (PYT). If you do have a depression, PYT'ing will consistently feel out of reach, so the advice simply worsens your self-esteem.

Getting a proper diagnosis is in line with other answers here: *Get proper help*. If you *do* have a depression, you cannot resolve it yourself. It will just worsen.

There are caveats to this: Even with a proper diagnosis, your family might still not understand your situation and will still advice you to just PYT. Getting a diagnosis may be difficult if you are displaying symptoms that are just below the diagnosis threshold. Do not satisfy yourself with a dismissal by a doctor that did not listen to you.

Diagnosing a depression is however entirely *subjective* to the examiner and how you are presenting yourself. You cannot have an objective diagnosis of mental disorder. As mentioned above, even with a clear-cut diagnosis, family members may still not be receptive of it.

There are various treatments to depressions. There are loads of psykofarmaka and getting the one that works *for you* might be tricky, especially if you want to avoid side-effects. You might also be advised to follow cognitive therapy, which can help you uncover what 'gets you down' and help find solutions to avoiding these situations, or provide better coping techniques.

**Get proper help!** Your family does not seem to understand or be willing to understand your issues (whether they are rooted in depression or self-afflicted, it really doesn't matter). Find other paths to turn things around.",2,2017-06-07 09:54:51

I'm better now that I am in a non-tenure-track position  at a smaller school, but the depression and thoughts still occur. Most of the time I can push through, but sometimes it's so overwhelming that I can barely move.

 I think graduate school is destructive for some because it isolates you. For years, whenever you interact with people outside of academia, no one understands what you do and why it's important, so unless you have an extraordinarily strong sense of self, everyone is always making you doubt your choice. You see others succeeding in careers and things that supposedly normal people do. You constantly have to rationalize your choice to forgo a lot of the typical milestones of adulthood to pursue something that--and this varies by program-- objectively has a much smaller impact on people's daily lives than many other professions.

It worked great all through school. I never went without it from my 2nd year as an undergrad, through my MA and my Ph.D..  I still return to it now and then.

Currently, I'm in a depressive phase, but have been letting myself take a breather for a few months to recover from 2017: I completed 13 different research projects last year (a couple journal articles but mostly invited chapters for various anthologies as well as 2 co-edited collections).

Personally, I'm also exploring nootropics -- but that's in part because I'm getting older and just don't have the mental energy I used to...  I also need to get going on my next book (due in about 16 months).",1,2018-02-21 17:53:38
d51imvj,t3_4kxyrw,,kojak211,,"Can Totally relate-At my Junior college I had a 3.9 and got into UCLA where my depression came back. It was very bad soph-senior year of high school and it became manageable during junior college. I barely got out with a 2.5. Most of it was because of me just being too down to even be able to withdrawal from a class. 


 A 2.5 will get me absolutely nowhere and that got me in a rut until I went to Asia and applied to a M.A in TEFL instruction. Looking back, I'm glad things turned out the way it did. I had a chance to experience living outside the U.S and broadened my interests. Best of all, I'm NOT in debt. I can pay for it all in cash by having a part time job teaching English. 

If that is your passion, you WILL find a way no matter how impossible it seems. People say my M.A from Asia is trash and not worth anything. I don't give a shit. My goal is to get the PHD and to teach Psychology and there is absolutely nothing that can stop me from getting there.

The only time I've been *really* worried about him was when he was on a bender, but started talking in a really depressed way (normally when he's really high, he's either pretty jolly or just out of it, not sad seeming). He was talking about his depression in general and how when he was a kid he only really found comfort in the fact that he would die someday, among other stuff.

I'd keep it more positive, more future-focused, and in no way critical of the committee. Downplay the depression aspect, or, ideally, cut it completely. You're essentially asking for a huge favor and not giving them many reasons to stick their neck out for you. Sure, you're paying tuition, but a faculty member's salary is unchanged either way, so why chance a lot of headaches on a potentially questionable student that might make life unpleasant for a whole lot of people (e.g. students, faculty, administrators) once admitted? What do you bring to the table? How will this program or department be better off as a result of admitting you? As a faculty member, what's in it for me to bring you on board?

You're not hoping to prove them wrong, you're looking to prove your own abilities. Nobody likes to be proven wrong, not even professors. 

Don't blame the previous course structure or number of exams for your past academic performance. Many grad courses will only have a midterm and a final, or even just a huge final. Don't set yourself up for someone to think ""This guy has a hard time with two-exam courses? He'll never make it in a grad program.""

You say the best way to prove yourself is for the committee to let you take grad credits and get good grades, but you're not getting A's in the material you're taking now, so that argument seems pretty flimsy. I'd drop that line of reasoning.

Basically they plan on reviewing my application by factoring my grades from this semester (they only had 1 semester of grades and I pulled a C average on them) I was thinking a letter showcasing the upward trend in my performance, which tracks with my depression quite nicely. I figure this would work in conjunction with the rest of the materials they already have.

Something like this:

To the admissions committee members, (dont know who heads it)
Paragraph 1: I understand that the first decision the committee came to was X, given my grades at the time, I probably would have done the same thing; however, as my personal statement briefly mentioned I have been dealing with depression because of Y which caused my grades to plummet in my first semester.

paragraph 2:
To its credit the committee has reopened my case with my spring semester grades in mind. I had a rough start to the spring semester, but ended up getting X grades, and even got a 99 on my last final in class Z. One of my classes I did not do as well in because there were only 2 exams, which made it harder to overcome a rough start. Otherwise, I feel my grades are starting to show my true academic abilities.

3: I expect this progress to maintain itself, and possibly even improve because after 1 year of dealing with this (and seeking treatment) things are starting to get better, and I have no intentions of stopping treatment anytime soon. Finally if any committee members are still not confident I can succeed at the graduate level, I urge you to give me a chance to prove you wrong, after all the easiest way to prove I am capable of succeeding at the graduate level is to let me take classes and earn good grades.

Clinical programs often focus research on more extreme psychology, while counseling is a more day-to-day type of practice. If your interest is in working with the normal person, who experiences relationship distress, or depression, or anxiety, or grief, or trauma, all of those are counseling topics. So is assessment. Counseling programs also offer a range of types.

Iowa State is one of the best in the nation, and although I'm in a different psych area, a close friend is counseling. It's a full day (8-5) of classes, practicum, and supervision. Normally 4 classes per semester, taken in a strict order. On top of that you're supposed to do research, although the expectations for output are lower (maybe a pub a year). Our department is heavily focused in clinical practice training.

A lot of what people would think of as therapy is done by social work master's, which is not always well-publicized. The PhD is usually a significant pay bump but is 3 more years and a lot more work, so it's a trade-off.

An ex went to George Washington in DC for counseling, and found the program was heavily program administration and research.

I don't know if this is obvious and I should shut up, but you might consider what kind of specialty you'd be interested and look up therapists in your area. See where they graduated from, and what degree.

If you struggle with depression, grad school and a career in academia might not be for you. Academia is the most emotionally unhealthy place I have ever been.

Graduate school is isolating and full of fear-mongering. You won't have time to exercise, be with loved ones, or nurture yourself emotionally. You will be run ragged every day of the week.

Finding and keeping work in academia is incredibly stressful. The jobs are scarce, so you will have to be okay with living wherever you happen to land a job, even if you don't know anyone or have any kind of support network there. If you get stuck adjuncting, you always wonder whether you'll have a job in three months. Oh, and if you adjunct, you don't get paid over the summer, so you'll have to wait tables or something.

I struggled with depression and anxiety somewhat in college, but I thought I was stable and healthy enough to take on grad school in my late 20s. Nope. After finishing my degree, I went to a therapist who diagnosed me with PTSD.

Those lazy people should have worked 75 hours a week! 

The thing with grad school is that everyone is at least very good and many are amazing. We're talking about a group of people where the ""dumb ones"" are the ones that only had 3.5 GPAs in undergrad or only won 3 major scholarships prior to finishing their bachelors. So you get a bunch of these high achievers together and make them compete for a decreasing number of tenure track positions. It's not irregular for there to be 200 applicants for a single tenure track position - each one of them having at least a PhD. 

My advice is: If you love it so much that even if you don't get tenure and even if there is no other career available to you with this degree that in and of itself justifies alll of your invested time and effort, you still won't regret having gone. You still will look back favourably on your choice to get a phd and the time you had.

My view is that you must start with the assumption that you *won't* get an academic job, because that's the most likely outcome by far. If you have the assumption, is it still with the PhD? And if so, you need to have a plan for how you transition from academia to a specific industry job. Otherwise you'll end up graduating, floundering, and falling into a depression. 

Okay, so say it's not worth the phd if you don't get an academic job, but there's literally nothing else on the planet that you can see yourself doing. Well, make sure you get into a top 10 program with a professor who has placed students within the last few years and has an excellent record of publications. Next, look at resumes of recently hired faculty (at least a few professors have their cv publicly available on their website or linked in).

I had a pretty rocky time during graduate school for similar reasons - academia is rife with PIs who are horrible managers of people, and many of us emerge with various amounts of impostor syndrome, maladaptive anxiety and procrastination / avoidance behaviours that either emerged or were amplified during that experience. What I have found that can sometimes help re-engage is some tricks suggested by cognitive behavioural therapy - try to distance yourself from the negative self-talk in your head that is constantly telling you you are not good enough - learning that that voice is just one part of me, and that I don't have to always listen to it - has helped me to emerge from deep depression where I just thought the whole world was against me - into some semblance of normal productive life. Another way to phrase it is say think of what is the worst possible thing that could happen, and what is the best possible thing that could happen - the reality will most likely be somewhere inbetween those two extremes. I would previously think of the worst case scenario, and then assume that is what was going to happen, which can sometimes be a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Now I can't necessarily say I have it ""all figured out"" - I still struggle with anxiety at times, my impostor syndrome has subsided somewhat as I've gotten a bit more comfortable (at least with ""faking it until you make it"" / and getting feedback that I was actually good at some of the things I purport myself to be good at); though there are rungs as with anything - once you stop comparing yourself to your peer group, you start comparing with leaders in your field, which is - once again, your contribution to society is judged purely on your own merits, not on some mythical comparison to others - and talk therapy and medication are also things I am not afraid to lean on and use when necessary.  

You're doing amazing, I'm sure your kids don't see anyone but a supermom trying her very best, and ditto for your students, so keep up the good, hard, work, and you will get to a better place.  Even giving yourself permission to feel the anxiety / live with the avoidance, and not beat yourself up about it further, is a small victory - three years is not that long in terms of getting over a traumatic grad school experience - it probably took me 5 years to crawl out of my post-grad school depression and impostor syndrome and into a better space.",1,2020-12-10 05:39:04

One grad student who did not attend my undergrad literally quoted the message referring to me a decade later, “you should not even be here.

A lot of people I know are saying things like, why am I so sad? Academia was always lonely. Motivation was always hard to come by. 

But really, when I think about it, one of the things that made academia tolerable in the first place was having a community of other intellectuals that cared about things I wanted to talk about. It feels really, really hard to find that right now. And you're also at a new institution, and you don't get to make friends! Plus, these days, zoom discussions are awkward and let's face it, they're a chore. Teaching, if you're doing any of that, isn't fun. Attending talks is exceedingly boring.

Getting to the next peak means you have to flatten out or even go down a little before you work your way back up. It sucks coming down! It took me probably a year to start coming out of the depression, and another year after that to feel human again. 

Now you need quality equipment (the things you know and learn) and a reliable climbing party - you can't make it alone. If your colleagues suck, though, it's gonna be ten times harder. (My postdoc also sucked. To run with this tortured metaphor, I had good group members but my Sherpa was some asshole from Miami with a stolen fur coat.

Before you decide to give up on academia, which is something you've spent quite a lot of time to get into and are obviously good at, please eliminate the following causes as other comments have also highlighted;

* toxic work environment (seeing as you feel isolated)
* type of work you've been doing (i.e. are you writing for fellow scientist/social relevance questions)
* is it COVID related? (these are strange times). 

 I had a TT job right out of my PhD in the social sciences, got it actually before the ceremony finished too. Did well for two years (4+ publications p.a. in Q1, 6 courses, supervising 3 PhDs, 1.5 mil in grants both local and EU).  Unfortunately, I was in a very toxic environment with senior colleagues who saw my achievements as threats. What followed was a year of verbal and physical abuse in person and over emails and calls. Add to that attempts to sabotage my career, including stealing data from my computer to asking students to torpedo my evals. I was declared sick by my company doctor and confidential advisors. Major depression, chronic illness as a result of untenable stress from the personal attacks. I had the same thoughts of is it worth it and I should just go back to industry where I was before. Not saying you had the same, but I recall exactly the same experience of feeling isolated and being drained by the environment I was in. I had no one I dared to voice my issues to. I had no one I could discuss content with, also for fear of retaliation or worse, getting ideas stolen again. I still like what I did, but I liked it less every day and I wondered if it was worth all the mental and physical harm. My saving grace was that I had already built up a robust and warm international network of peers and colleagues. I realised after a conference that that was exactly what I lacked - intellectual support and community. 

I was invited (luckily) to be a visiting prof elsewhere. Shortly after that, a tenured position there opened up and I was invited to apply and got it. After a devastating year, chronic exhaustion and developing chronic asthma, I quit. I still remember the shitstorm that came when I resigned. I can say I am very much more happy and content now that I have moved away from the shit show of a department. 

The only positive things out of my bad experience is that I made some agreements with myself which I hope you might consider:

* I'll only work with people I know and trust...and those they know and trust. Seems unfair but really, life is too short to get backstabbed constantly. 
* I will build and maintain an intellectual community and nurture those who enter. Jobs might last a few years, but collaboration can last a lifetime!
* I will only work on research that satisfies my intellectual curiosity and is not harmful to society. If I'm going to be expending energy on something, I better like it intrinsically.
* I have a duty to pay my lessons forward. I mentor young academics who run into the same issues. Unfortunately, we are not alone. The more people talk about this, the better.
* I derive great joy from teaching and will continue to do so but I will not do service disproportionately to my peers. 
* I am more than my job. Socialising, hobbies, keeping strict boundaries between work and life are not essential. They are crucial parts of your career.

I don't think this is about you taking the research personally. I think some people just find certain things squeamish, and others don't. I would never be able to do the work you do - I tried reading t_d one time and was out in like 5 minutes - so I went in a different direction in my life. Or, like, a lot of people faint at blood. It's a purely instinctual reaction, not their fault, but a career that involves a lot of dissection probably isn't for them. Which sucks if you've pivoted your career to a point where it's difficult to get out of dissection or reading hateful tweets (I promised I'd be unhelpful!), but, hey, at least don't blame yourself.

Perhaps more saliently,

&gt; but from a research perspective this is the kind of work that I think is essential for academics to engage in.

While that may well be true, it doesn't mean that it's essential for *you personally* to engage in this work. I have someone close to me whose academic career was basically decimated because he went into a field where the daily work wasn't something he enjoyed. It wasn't morally reprehensible, he was perfectly intellectually capable at it, but - it was like if a person who hated math decided to become a statistician. It just wore him down over the years to the point of suicidal depression. And this happens to so many people, actually. Impressionable young people pick a subfield (or worse, a field) based on how much ""impact"" they can have, or how important they perceive the work to be, often with no regard to how well-suited they themselves are to the work. And then, a few years down the line, it turns out that splendid dreams of fame and universal gratitude don't sustain them in the regular 12 hour outlays. If this work is actively painful for you, maybe consider pivoting to something else. I promise you, there will be no global cataclysm if you decide not to sacrifice your life at this altar.

gdaft5j,t3_jz34mq,True,manova,t2_35w8d,"First, neuropsychology is usually considered a subspecialty of clinical psychology that does assessment following stroke or TBI or for dementia, or other related cases.  You are probably looking for neuroscience. 

It really depends on how you want to approach this and you can do it from either field.  In psychology, you would likely look at clinical psychology.  Talk therapies are effective for the treatment of depression, and there is constant research to refine effective therapies and identify mediating/moderating variables related to its effectiveness.  Additionally, there is research into what types of access is needed to help people.  Some people also have more basic research interest and look at more psychophysiological measures related to depression. 

Neuroscientists do not often have direct patient access (though they could).  Many work on animal models of depression screening potential drugs or drug targets.  We don't really know how depression works in the brain and the theories we have are basically based on the fact that we accidentally discovered some drugs that seem to help and we try to refine those drugs.  If we are ever going to make a real effective drug, we first have to figure out the brain mechanism for depression (though as a side note, it is likely there are multiple brain mechanisms that all appear outwardly as depression, so this is not an easy task).  Often (but not always) behavioral neuroscience looks at animal models (mainly mice or rats for depression) and cognitive neuroscience looks at human subjects.  With human subjects, you can see overlaps with clinical psychologist and/or psychiatrists.  

Psychiatry is a specialty of medicine.  You are first and foremost trained to be a medical doctor and treat patients with depression.  If you want to do research as a physician, often the two routes are to do a combined MD/PhD program (very, very competitive) or do a research fellowship (kind of like how PhDs do a post-doc).  Most psychiatrists would focus on clinical trials of new medications developed for the treatment of depression.  But you do have physicians doing more basic science as well.  A friend of mine worked for a physician that was researching the physiological mechanism of why people with heart disease are more likely to have depression. 

So all of this really depends on which aspect of depression you want to research.  Assuming you are an undergraduate, for any of these paths, take lots of science.  I might recommend a biology major with a psychology minor.  If you want to do a psychology major, do the pre-med curriculum with it or minor in biology.  Even if you go the clinical psychology route, a biology major with a psych minor would be great.  If your school has an undergrad neuroscience program, you can look into that as well (no matter which route you end up taking).",3,2020-11-23 02:03:24

It sounds like you have tried repeating the class many, many times with the same academic strategies. If you want to pass it you will need to change something. I'd recommend starting by setting up a meeting with your current professor and expressing that you REALLY want to learn this material to pass the class next time but clearly can't figure out how. Talk through the strategies you are using to study and see if they have advice or can direct you to other resources on campus that may help you approach the material in a more effective way. And, you probably already know this because you discuss depression and anxiety, but your discounting your hard work and abilities are not helping yourself. For example, if you had turned in the 2nd exam and gotten even a 40% that would be much better than a zero for your likelihood of passing the class.

Professors love it when students truly want to learn the materials. I'm guessing this is an extremely large class because at a small school I suspect someone would have stopped you and flagged you for some kind of academic help/meetings before taking the class EIGHT times. This help is almost certainly still available through your school but you need to seek it out yourself.

Best of luck. Science is full of tenacious people who don't give up when things get hard. You've certainly got a jump on figuring out how to do that if you can get past this hurdle.",1,2020-11-17 13:16:20

I know many universities abroad prefer their university level English teachers to have a master’s degree, but generally specify a preference in an English or Literature-related degree. Would continuing on with a Political Science MA be near useless towards this endeavor? I’m not exactly financially or personally committed in any way (beyond disappointing my family yet again haha) to the program since I’ve not begun yet, and would be happy to apply for a future semester in a program which would allow me to more easily obtain a university level position.

fpfznx9,t3_gd0nb5,True,xXxlandvaluetax69xXx,t2_2v1cv97c,"Ok so I'll mainly summarise my experience.

When I finished my undergrad I was very sick with depression. I chose a university very close to my undergrad one for my masters and focused on keeping my commitments low and focusing on studying, which worked. I had never lived outside of my home country (Scotland).

I applied to universities mainly out of who would make a good supervisor. Through a mix of fortune and circumstance, I ended up getting a PhD place in a university in Italy, which I didn't think I would get accepted to.

When I was set to go there I was extremely anxious. I had no idea about Italian healthcare, being away from my family, living in a country I didn't know the language of, and also the pressure of attending such a good university.

In the end, it was fine. The PhD was very difficult but I don't think being in Italy really made it much more difficult. The university had good counselling services when I needed it, I had a good supervisor, and was able to make good supportive friendships there that gave me emotional support. So the actual location itself wasn't much of a problem. In fact, I'm glad I went there in hindsight and really think it was the right thing to do. I completed my PhD perfectly well there.

What I think is important about this is that it was a good university, I had a good supervisor relevant to my research interests, and the university had excellent support for its students. Importantly, I knew these factors before I was able to go. This is all not to say my story will apply perfectly to everyone, but I hope it might help with any worries you have.",1,2020-05-04 10:51:09

3). The SSRI type antidepressants ""work"" for about 20-50% more of the population than a placebo in clinical trials (depending on the study).  By its very nature, depression is often an intermittent and/or cyclical disorder, that can resolve spontaneously, or be worsened by life events that no drug can solve -these are not magic.  So the effect size varies, but on the whole they work better than nothing (placebo).

4). It is very hard to control for even who took the drugs compliantly in those studies - at least under FDA rules.  You can do blood tests, but you still have to publish the failed trial if patients were non compliant.

5). In addition to placebo controlled studies, there are relapse studies required for approval.  These are studies where someone who shows improvement on the drug, maintains this for some duration (I forget what it is exactly - but like 2 months or so) and then get taken of the drug.  These are very powerful studies, because you have baselines for that person, then an improvement and then the relapse.

6). The tests that measure depression include many symptoms of depression that SSRI's don't improve - like comorbid cognitive dysfunction (brain fog) and anhedonia - so the improvement on the other mood symptoms is ""washed out""a bit by those.  Still not useless.

7). Some people are refractory to some or even all medications (no meds help them).

So that study (and in fact the great body of evidence) doesn't say 

&gt;But analyses of the published data and the unpublished data that were hidden by drug companies reveals that most (if not all) of the benefits are due to the placebo effect.

And there is no big Pharma conspiracy to hide data.

And now I am annoyed that I had to stand up for drug companies and SSRI's because they are indeed overprescribed IMO and many doctors really over-rate their efficacy because they, too, do not understand the placebo effect (spoiler alert, there is none) or data .  That may be in part due to marketing on the part of the companies, but it is not due to hiding data.

You in fact do not ever need to hide data, because humans are just totally non-responsive to overwhelming data if it is not what they want to believe.

This by the way, is NOT an example of the the non-existent ""placebo effect"", but rather the fact that some depressed people get better when not on a drug measure the rate of spontaneous remission.  Which is a thing that happens even if the people are not in a drug trial.",4,2020-04-29 21:53:13

&gt;One-fifth of respondents reported being bullied; and one-fifth also reported experiencing harassment or discrimination.

&gt;Of the respondents who reported concerns, one-quarter said that their institution had provided support, but one-third said that they had had to seek help elsewhere.

A PhD involves highly able, highly driven, and probably perfectionist, students who are thrown into a very unstructured job with remarkably few *actionable* supports, on low pay, where their success is measured by the sum total amount of work they output, and who really desperately care about doing a good job.

In this situation, all you need are a couple of people willing to work very long hours and then everyone else copies in order to keep up. You *can* take afternoons and weekends off for the entire 3 years, but the person you're competing against for a job sure as hell won't. You simply can't have everything. The more time you spend at the gym, the less time you're working. But if you e.g. spend no time at the gym then you'll get very ill and your productivity will drop. So it's about balance, and the most reasonable or acceptable balance for a lot of PhD students involves more work than anything else. It's a choice people make, and you may make the same choice when faced with the costs of each.",1,2020-04-11 12:55:56

As personal advice, I’d recommend doing all you can to push through it though and keep with your current plans. My dad passed away in my 2nd year of undergrad, and while I wasn’t going for grad school yet since I wasn’t a senior, I know after experiencing what that was like that I would’ve regretted putting life off for a year. It’s extremely hard to lose someone you love, but it’ll get easier every single day. Some days will be harder than others, but in general it’ll be easier with time. I was so distraught when it first happened that I literally had someone feeding me to get me to eat. All of my friends talked to my teachers and all of them accommodated my situation for a few weeks, which was enough for me to start being somewhat functional. It was not easy by any means, but I was able to return back to normal life (of course, with grieving involved..... but not to the point I couldn’t function) within the month. I have no idea what I would’ve done for a whole year. I would’ve probably just fallen into a depression watching everyone move on with their lives, knowing I didn’t, and having so much time to focus on the death. Returning back to normal life and learning how to grieve while continuing on really helped me more than most would think. I would’ve crumbled if I put everything on hold. I’m not really sure if this is helpful.... it’s sort of a rant of my own thoughts and experiences having gone through something similar. In summary, it’s by far the hardest the first few weeks but will get somewhat easier after those weeks pass, and for me personally returning to regular life seriously helped me in my grieving process.",1,2020-04-11 04:16:42

fmyeqmy,t3_fxw1is,True,SnowblindAlbino,t2_7ild5,"Department chair here and veteran of the last downturn (and graduate student during the early 1990s recession too). Literally \*most\* schools in the US had hiring freezes in 2009-2010, especially public institutions that were subject to budget cuts. But then there was a massive enrollment boom in 2011-2013 or so as people sought higher ed in hope of securing new/better jobs. While conservative legislatures didn't rush to reinstate budgets, tuition revenues helped and hiring resumed at many schools. *However*: neoliberal institutional leaders and boards seized the chance to make their labor forces more ""nimble"" or ""flexible"" in case there was another downturn-- and they did that by hiring legions of contingent faculty and reducing those in tenure-track positions.Those faculty, of course, are likely to be the first to lose their jobs now.

I was at a private institution then-- still am --and we actually actually kept hiring throughout the crash because it was a buyer's market and our president was smart; we were able to hire outstanding faculty who would otherwise have been snapped up by more prestigious schools. Happily most of them stayed with us.

Things are different this time. I think it's highly unlikely there will be a massive increase in enrollments after the virus is gone, in part because the demographics are different now than a decade ago. Then we were at the apex of a curve...there were more 18-year-olds then than now, and while we know the numbers will recover again briefly around 2025 they'll go down again after. Moreover, most of the growth we'll see in the early 20s will be in groups that are not traditionally as likely to pursue higher ed and are concentrated in the sunbelt and west coast, far away from the concentration of increasingly empty colleges in the Midwest and New England. Administrators know this and will not hire TT faculty for what at best may be a 3-5 year mini-boom post-COVID. More likely-- and this is my real fear --we'll have a second wave of the virus this fall and enrollments will drop 20-25% at non-elite four-year schools. Tenured faculty will lose their jobs, many smaller institutions will close, and the only places to see real growth will be community colleges as students seek the safety of living at home and working.

There's nothing good to see in this. It may be, in fact, the worst downturn in higher education the US since the Great Depression. And we'll never recover, because there will be no Baby Boom or GI Bill to save the day, and no shared vision of higher education as an engine of economic growth and social mobility. These are dark days, and I fear they will get darker in the fall. If I were in graduate school today I would absolutely be looking for another career path as I think the traditional tenure-track academic career will be gone in a generation, with few exceptions at flagship and elite schools. This is a black swan moment for higher ed and we simply were not prepared for it nor are we resilient enough for all institutions to survive. The longer the crisis lasts the worse the impacts will be...many smaller institutions have only a few months of operating reserves in liquid assets. Once we see them burning their endowment principle, seeking loans to balance budgets, or declaring exigency the writing will be on the wall.",5,2020-04-10 02:07:13

I still have several friends in academia and kept in touch with my old group.  There are pros and cons to working in academic research.  The pros are easy to see, the cons aren't as apparent.

[Grad studies is renowned for depression](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-emotional-toll-of-graduate-school/#:~:text=A%20recent%20Harvard%20study%20concluded,mental%20health%20disorders%20and%20depression.&amp;text=Most%20people%20probably%20lump%20doctoral,such%20as%20law%20or%20medicine).  Research is hard - constant failure, mostly insignificant positive results, actual novel success is quite rare.  It's way easier being the research prof overseeing dozens of students' work as just part of their jobs.  Of course there's pressure to produce results - a high volume of work is required to get those few results that earn grant $$$.  It took all these profs many years of hard work and shitty pay as grad students/post docs to get those coveted tenured positions.  So they know how shitty the work life is, and they don't care - they already paid their dues. 

Politics is huge in academia.  Profs with tenure are there FOR LIFE so there's few consequences for bad behavior - there's always someone with a superiority complex pullling power trips and pettiness.  Word gets around if a department has problems with drama and bad blood.  You want to become a prof at your own hometown university?  Yeah it's probably not going to happen if you got any of your degrees there - permanents are only hired to enhance the school's prestige, i.e. targeting people  from other prestigious schools.   And it's incredibly competitive... 

If you still want to get a grad degree, BE SELECTIVE.  Don't just blindly take this prof's random offer because it's an easy choice and lets you defer bigger decisions for a few years.  Sort out what you want to research / where you want to do it, and what you want to do with the degree afterwards.

You can apply to do grad studies ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD so if you ever wanted to live abroad, this is a prime opportunity.  Yeah grad studies was depressing but I got to spend a year living in JAPAN doing my research, which was absolutely worth it.

Only take a grad research position if it pays you enough of a stipend to cover tuition and some living expenses.  Yes generally researchers have $$ for a particular research project, so you might not be able to cherry pick your topic but look for opportunities with researchers who work in your general area of interest, you will get exposure to more stuff.

Expect to pursue an Industry job with your degree. Search job postings for your target degree, and see what other qualifications typically go with it.  It's pretty rare for your specific topic of grad research to end up highly relevant to your job, but the skills you learn should be transferrable to what you want to do professionally.",1,2020-10-20 20:09:55

g86wxbf,t1_g86vl28,True,MoonlightsHand,t2_30upu8y6,"&gt; Students will share test questions. It's unreaonable to expect them not to.

""Oh my god did you get question 9??? Was that even studied this semester?! How'd you approach it?""

That's acceptable.

""I slipped an exam paper out when we had all finished and photocopied it, but everyone already sat the exam so that's fine right?""

That's pretty clearly not.

""Here's our best recollection of every single question that 5 of us could recall, including the keywords used in every question.""

Also not acceptable.

""I'm going to _create a goddamn forum post_ in order to share as many stolen questions as I can so that future students can cheat.""

Very obviously not acceptable.

Basically the threshold is ""are you chatting to a mate after the exam, or are you making a concerted effort to help others cheat?""

&gt; Going from [a friend asking] to making notes after the test in case someone asks, or to share with a group in exchange for notes about other tests, is a small step.

The size of the step isn't what makes treading it acceptable. If your slippery slope takes a _real long time to slip_, that doesn't make it less of a slope. 

&gt; I respect that writing tests is hard work. Ideally, there would be a huge, public pool of vetted questions, and creating a test would just be randimly selecting some of these.

Ahahahahaha no that would be the _worst possible_ way to do it because then you couldn't tailor anything to your own specific content or style of teaching. How I teach is going to be drastically different to how someone else teaches: even if we cover the same content, what my colleague and I tell our students is going to differ at least a bit. 

_That's exactly why writing tests is so hard._ 

You can't just take questions from someone else and drop them into your test. You have to make sure that what you have is both accurate to what you taught and accurate to how you teach it, and you have to cover enough of a spectrum that your students can't just regurgitate stuff. I have one question in particular that I'm REALLY proud of in one of my exams because it's genuinely very fun and challenging without being excessively difficult. It's just very slightly above the curve of what I've taught, but every single building block is there to let those kids who've really applied themselves figure it out for themselves. If some punk-ass kid stole that and published it online, I'd lose my number one question for distinguishing between smart kids who nevertheless can't think outside of a rote learnt box, and ingenious little buggers who can think on the fly and truly understand the course material rather than just regurgitating information. 

_That's_ why we hate question-thieves. They aren't just stealing a good exam question. They're stealing our primary means of understanding what separates our students and who is more than just ""bright with good prospects"". I've had kids who do _abysmally_ on specific assignments and then come into these exams and do phenomenally on those kinds of questions. That tells me that this is probably a kid who's struggling with something at home: are they working too many hours and can't prioritise their coursework? Are they just resentful of something that takes 15 hours to complete? Are they struggling with undiagnosed ADHD or depression or similar? 

On the other hand, if I have a kid who is _suspiciously_ good at assignments and then fail to repeat that performance in an exam? That tells me I need to take another once-over on the _rest_ of their work because something doesn't add up there and it's pretty likely they're buying their papers.",3,2020-10-09 05:52:01

Before my dog I also could go whole weekends without leaving my apartment... literally Friday night to Monday morning without doing anything. Scout (my dog) is a pretty high-energy breed (border collie / catahoula mix) so he had to be walked twice a day, no matter what. 

In terms of financials, based on what you said, I'd consider starting a pet savings account for the dog - it sounds like right now you're not too concerned with finances, so putting aside some money once a month won't be a big deal, and it'll help buffer against any sicknesses or anything that might happen later after you graduate.

ft067eh,t1_fsvqyqm,True,SurvivingJupiter,t2_45mmqa9l,"I think this is two separate issues. Both a bit beyond what your professors or us the random internet can provide help on. Before giving you my 2 cents, I want to point you to some other avenues. One is [7 cups](https://www.7cups.com/) of tea, a free online listener service. Depression sometimes manifests as lack of interest in things we previously enjoyed. Even if it's not depression, sometimes talking it over with people who have no connection to you help. Your insurance can point you toward actual therapists as well, your school likely has a counseling center too. 

First issue,

&gt;but I'm like, 'I just don't know how to get good grades and won't be able to know until I'm done'.

Second issue

&gt; Besides, if I'm not going that way, I don't know what to do in my life. 

I'm going to address number 2 first. It's absolutely fine and okay and even normal to not know what you want to do with your life. A lot of people feel like that throughout different points in their lives and careers. Even people in their 50s! What you can do is be smart about it. In your case you're halfway to a degree. If you switch majors, what credits can you reuse? What majors share courses you've already passed? What careers use those degrees? What careers could you get with the current degree plus a switch in fields with a masters degree? So that's part A, what degree can you get in two years, and what would you have to do to get it, what will it cost (cash, loans and time), and what do potential futures look like from there. 

 Part B - Big picture, a specific resource for thinking about careers is a book, ""What Color is Your Parachute"". There's plenty of career assessments out there, [here](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/career-aptitude-tests) is an article that talks about 7 different free ones. Your guidance office or student center may have additional (better) tests available too. What about non degree jobs too? There's really good money to be made in some careers that go through trades. What would you want to do if nothing else mattered? We don't exist in vacuums, having to spend years and money on schooling or learning a trade is a factor. But consider in vacuum, if none of that was an issue what would you do? What steps would be needed to get to that career? How does the time, money, effort, required to get there compare to the ones needed to finish existing degree? 

If you loved math but aren't enjoying/succeeding at higher level college math (proving theorems omg) - adjacent interests might be accounting, finance, business, economics, statistics, even physics and engineering.  (Here's a whole [article](https://www.moneyunder30.com/25-high-paying-careers-that-dont-require-a-college-degree#for-math-statistics-and-technology-buffs) on jobs without a college degree that use math too if after reflection finishing the degree isn't the choice, because 2 more years is $$$$).

Ok back to issue number 1, you can't keep your grades up. I feel like I give this advice a lot: Get a binder per class, get a planner, write down every single assignment and test and due date from the syllabus and as they are given into the planner. Never go to a class without your class binder and your planner, store your notes in order in the binder. No excuses. Getting organized is the biggest hurdle to success. Read the book chapter before class. Use the planner to work backward from exam dates. Be revising and reviewing your notes and old homeworks thru the whole term, not just 2 weeks before the exam. Review your notes within 7 days of taking them, preferably the night after you take them. Rework the example problems when you do this, can you do them without looking at your notes consistently? Do you understand all the steps? Then start the homework. If you can't re-solve the class note problems without your notes, go to office hours, show them where you are getting stuck. Connect sections in the book to the notes, mark up your notes, keep a nice deck of practice problems to solve again before the exams based on your notes. 

Honestly, in your case I suspect it may just be that lack of interest in the material is causing you to decline in class performance. Both in the actual math and possibly in the idea of math as a career (and anxiety at trying to find a new path). There's also the common experience where you were the best in high school in an area, and in college you suddenly are not the best or even the top 10. It's hard to adjust. It's hard to realize you need to ask for help, to study. Don't let your ego keep you from something you want. I learned that one the hard way my sophomore year too.

Ok, super long post is long. Good luck to you! Don't be scared to quit, Don't be scared to push on. Life has lots of endless options, none of them are really wrong choices, sometimes just detours you didn't expect.",1,2020-06-05 19:28:51

Frankly, I can't begin to understand why your advisor would propose this during a pandemic, let alone during a pandemic and nationwide protests. While working can be an effective coping mechanism for some, it isn't for many.

I'd understand the workshop proposal if several students asked for external accountability. I'd also understand it if your advisor made it clear that it was optional.

Graduate students, along with contingent faculty, are the most vulnerable in academia. We should not be asking them to do anything on top of their regular research/teaching. Especially during the summer and especially during a global crisis. We *should* be checking in to wish them well, to offer leads on internal/external funding, and to answer questions about dissertation progress.

It's a real failure of imagination on your advisor's part to not think: some of my students might be dealing with illness or the death of a loved one. Some might be dealing with anxiety and depression in light of escalating racial tensions. Some might be putting themselves at risk in order to participate in these protests.

As you can see, I'm extremely frustrated with your advisor's email. However, I don't want to assume that just because they made a thoughtless demand means that they won't be understanding if students decline to participate.

***You should absolutely decline to participate.*** Don't offer to go last, present something short, etc. **Don't** give in if they make those suggestions (unless you're absolutely sure it will cost you that relationship. If they're generally a good mentor, as you say, then it'll be fine).

No matter **when** you present or **what** you present, you will feel drained and frustrated for however many weeks or months leading up to this *totally unnecessary exercise*. Respond with something like:

""Dear Prof. X,

I trust this finds you well. Thanks for your email. Unfortunately I won't be able to participate in the summer workshop. I have a parent who lost ...  and ended up getting tear-gassed. I will continue to move forward with my research despite limited access to materials, and I look forward to touching base again in the fall. Thank you so much for understanding. Please stay safe and healthy.

Best wishes,

Me""

And then I just wouldn't check my email for a few days. If they respond immediately, you'll feel pressure to respond immediately. Take some time. If they push back but in a fairly ""nice"" way, then I'd reiterate, ""I'm so sorry, but I won't be able to participate this summer. Thank you for your patience."" *You could even ask about a late fall workshop if that actually interests you.* If they push again, then I understand you may have to acquiesce.

Do **NOT** include: ""I am worried that I'm not going to have much."" This invites them to challenge/reassure you that you'll do fine and that you really should participate.

Your advisor isn't technically allowed to ***require*** that you do this. But I should acknowledge the power asymmetry and the fact that some advisors do make absurd demands.

I hope this helps. Good luck with everything.",2,2020-06-01 19:57:27
frknbgk,t3_gp1meq,True,SurvivingJupiter,t2_45mmqa9l,"I used to be teaching students daily in lab, I was really looking forward to the summer batch of them. My PI and I had a fight the last day we were in lab, I was arguing that my bioinformatics team should be work from home regardless of lack of university shut down, city we live in was getting really unsafe to commute on public transit with the virus. PI wanted everyone in lab until mandatory they not be there. We tabled the argument to run an experiment, got the university email that afternoon telling us to lockdown the lab and send everyone home. That was over 2 months ago. It's really weird. My PI says we might start having wet lab work again this summer, maybe June. But now they are on board with ""bioinformatics stays home"". I don't like having won this argument. One of my undergrad volunteers gave up. Another is putting in maybe 1/16th their previous effort, that one in particular was looking forward to shifting to data generation this summer instead of analysis and now it's on hold. Another isn't sure if they should go home to China and maybe get stuck there or stick it out in the US despite online courses for the indefinite future. I feel less motivated as an instructor, it's hard to tell if things are clicking or not with students via remote. Normally at that point in the lab I'd let them go try something solo and explain it to me as they do it, quick test to see if they are getting it. If they are spacing out because bored that solves it, and if they aren't getting it, it gave insight to where they were lost. I can't do that now. A quick handdrawn diagram now takes twice as long to sketch photo and email, or attempt to sketch in powerpoint. My own research projects are on hold, waiting on bench work. I've become a writer, I spend a good portion each day working on manuscripts, and editing grad students work. That's not what I loved in the lab. It's not gained appeal in isolation. 

I wish I had gotten out of my city before lockdown. I didn't want to put my family at risk, traveling via plane seemed risky. Taking time off work (then not yet remote) seemed hazardous to my post doc career. But I could have made it home and self quarantined. I'm so exhausted without having done anything. I live in a studio, I stare at the same 4 walls. I live alone, I'm a tactile person and not having hugged someone for so long is the worst. Finding the energy to get out of bed feels like conquering Everest. None of my usual depression coping skills are working, most of them involved being around other people and going to museums and doing things we can't right now. Even running outside is hard, too many people to social distance, some idiots still not wearing masks. 

I think the worst is the not knowing when this will end.",1,2020-05-23 18:48:15

I am doing a second postdoc after I took some time off from research and I am loving it. I was very depressed and miserable during my first postdoc, and because of the depression and burnt-out I lost passion for everything I was doing, and for science in general. After finishing my postdoc I took 3 years off from research. I decided to come back and I am very happy now. I think I was burnt-out and also I realized I never had a good mentor until now. My new mentor is very encouraging and is the one that reminds me every week why science and research is cool.

fqexdpi,t3_gih6zc,True,capybarasleigh,t2_zjyi6no,"will they let you accept, but defer entry for one year?

some programs permit this, some don’t

the only thing i’d add is that an early 2020s GFC &amp; Greater Depression, even Recession, will make PhD applications far more competitive for the next few years

lots of tech workers return to industry for a few years after bacc, Masters, or while finishing dissertation, so norms are slightly different than other industries",2,2020-05-12 20:26:04
g7cbr5e,t3_j3gvsl,True,TheOwlGod,t2_13bbsh,"Recent physics Ph.D. here. Let me start by saying that you are definitely not the only one who has these thoughts. It's rough, realizing you just signed up for ""College Part Two: This Time There Are Fewer Friends,"" and looking around and seeing your undergrad friends moving on and becoming real people.

I will also tell you that it can become worse. I don't think a single person from my cohort didn't think about calling quits around year 3ish. The combination of pressure from your PIs and your students and having no power to actually do anything to alleviate that pressure can be really rough.

That being said, it does sound like you might be having it a bit worse. I'm glad to hear you're talking to someone about this --- I struggle with depression, too, and I remember projecting a lot of that onto work at times. I kept standing back and asking myself if I would actually feel better if I left, or if I would attribute my depression would just transfer to a new target.

Here's my advice: Stick it out until you qualify for the master's degree. That should only take 2 years, so reassess then. With a master's, your job prospects are pretty good in various fields (programming, finance, data science). Financially, it's generally better to have a master's than either a bachelor's or doctorate. It also gives you time to really decide what's right for you. You're what, a month in? There is an adjustment period from the rigor of undergrad to grad; give yourself a chance to adapt and succeed.",2,2020-10-01 23:11:12
g72rs49,t3_j1yk75,True,Harrisonfjord22,t2_3cprd3hp,"Honestly a PhD is no longer worth the stress, hassle, and general harassment I received. It's damaged me mentally and I suffer from severe depression. My advice would be, truly evaluate whether it makes sense for you to sacrifice everything (jobs, being close to family, etc.) and whether you have the resources you need to be successful. Ruining yourself financially, even if you have a ""full scholarship"" or tuition waiver is not worth it. 

Carefully evaluate your finances and try to work alongside your degree so you don't end up on the market with little to no job experience.",3,2020-09-29 16:28:54
g5qieoo,t3_ivahfn,True,ManInBlackHat,t2_12ckxc,"&gt; But with the conference, listening to everyone’s presentations on small details of hypothetical scenarios ... I am just left thinking, is any of this important? Why am I spending my time on this, when the world is going to crap? 

It could be depression from current state of the world getting to you; but it could also be a deeper truth reveling itself to you as well. Practically speaking not enjoying the work you are doing, or seeing the value of the work you are doing is a sign that in the long run you will not be happy in a *very* demanding career. 

Back before I did my graduate studies a couple of my colleagues (I was a programmer at the time) advised me to avoid research into computer science since ""all of the low hanging fruit has been plucked, and most people are not happy with making an incredibly small improvement to a known solution."" They weren't wrong and I ended up doing my graduate studies in a computer science adjacent field (computational science and engineering) where the focus is less on the incremental improvements can be more on the big problems (e.g., climate change, public health, etc.). 

My experience has generally been that those thoughts don't really go away. Some people thrive looking at incredibly niche topics purely due to the intellectual joy they experience; however, other people enjoy knowing that their work has a measurable (if small) impact upon the broader world around them. If you are in the category it might not be such a bad idea to explore interdisciplinary (or even transdisciplinary) research if you want to stay adjacent to where you started. Of course, there's also nothing wrong with changing disciplines as well! I've known people over the years that started in A, got their PhD in B, ended up in C as professors, and eventually retired a couple more steps removed!",9,2020-09-18 19:57:42
g5er28i,t3_itgwfb,True,phenomenologist83,t2_63ubkdkl,"As an assistant professor, who has earned a phd in the last 5 years and teaches and advises PhD students, I do feel I xan answer this question for you (as opposed to everyone else saying ""only you can answer this question""). Your phd will not grant you a job in academia, and if you already have a MA or and MSc, the industry, generally, doesn't need any more than that to consider you highly prepared. 

A phd is not only 4 or more years of studying and low pay. For many it's depression, anxiety, overwhelming pressures and yes, low income. It's  the type of hard work you wont just handle well. It may really mess up with you. I would absolutely not like having a phd student who (1) doesnt know these things, (2) is not sure that they'll endure the program, (3) might just leave at any point. We put in time and effort in your training. If you don't  hold up your end of the contract you may be in for a rough few years or dismissal from the program.",8,2020-09-15 22:12:23
g597q7s,t3_iryzhu,True,musamea,t2_4h9ky4lp,"Not much else to add except that graduate school in the humanities--and English is what I went for--is a total mindfuck. It's a system that involves a lot of hazing and a lot of wearing you down to see ""what you're made of."" If you're going to do that, you need to be as mentally stable as possible going into it. I took five years off between degrees and thank God, because 23-year-old me could not have handled the mind games people played (whereas 28-year-old me could see what people were doing, to some extent). A lot of people didn't make it through, and I know that depression was most often the culprit. And I didn't suffer from serious depression, but grad school was at times the most mentally and emotionally strenuous thing I've ever done, with many dark days where I cried myself to sleep. 

Again--I'm the sort of person who actually enjoyed grad school for the most part and was very successful, and loved writing and research. But there were some events that were absolutely staggering for me to deal with. (Examples: being publicly humiliated in a seminar because I completely misunderstood the critic; almost failing my comprehensive exams despite studying my ass off; having my prospectus rejected multiple times; having my first and second dissertation chapters hand-waved away by adviser multiple times; being taken to the woodshed by a Famous Scholar ^((TM)) at a major conference, rejections and more rejections on the job market; some nasty readers reports I'm not even going to go into--oh, and did I mention I was considered the ""most successful"" person in my cohort, who won a major elite dissertation fellowship never before won by anyone in my entire university? Yes, that's what I went through as supposedly the ""most successful."")

It's also worth saying that university teaching--at least the kind of teaching you're probably thinking about--is pretty much on its last legs, and may not exist anymore in the future. 

When I first went to grad school 11 years ago, I was warned about the bad job market. I didn't listen. Or--I listened to people who said things like, ""It's bad now, but it'll totally turn around in five years!"" It didn't. It just got worse and worse and worse, and now we're in COVID times, so that's that. So the kind of job that's your ideal doesn't exist anymore and probably won't come back into existence in the next 5 or 10 years. English professors are probably going the way of Blockbuster Video clerks or VCR repair people, so that's as good a reason as any to let go of the English professor dream--at least for a little while.",2,2020-09-14 17:31:17
g58p8gx,t1_g58n9di,True,Lady_Mallard,t2_ucuqd,"That was my feeling, too. Maybe try to have weekly meetings with her for the rest of this year - they can be quick, say 15-30 minutes - to make sure she is staying on top of things and to assign tasks/have conversations that might spark more curiosity. It’s been hard to stay motivated and fight depression during this pandemic as a professional researcher; I’m sure students feel the same. 
All that being considered, she likely realizes she is falling short and either 1) needs a confidence boost/some extra guidance (especially being straight out of undergrad); and/or 2) may just need to be told what she already knows - she is falling short - in order to get more serious. 
  As far as developing more of a PI mindset, is she connected to other PhD students during the pandemic? I learned a lot about what I should be doing as a PhD student by comparing myself with others and learning about their habits and activities. Perhaps you or the program can coordinate more peer-to-peer mentoring opportunities during the pandemic? 

Good luck, to both of you!",1,2020-09-14 15:37:23
g58o0sz,t1_g58n9di,True,25topolarbear,t2_7uil41q2,"This could be the problem, but if they aren't productive for long periods of time it could also be lack of clear guidance/deadlines. I don't want to jump straight to depression and time off, more structure could really help.",7,2020-09-14 15:30:08
g57b4bp,t3_iryzhu,True,LilySouth,t2_3f9sj9rp,"You mentioned you have bipolar illness. I really recommend Kay Redfield Jamison's book, ""An Unquiet Mind."" (She is an academic, but she had to give up her dream of being a medical doctor and stick to psychology). So much of what you describe is discussed in her autobiography. I think it will give you hope.

I think there are two issues here. One is your mental illness; two is despair at being unable to pursue your dreams. I think you need to prioritize the first concern right now. Get healthy and stabilize your life. Keep going with medication and therapy, try to implement some structure to your life, and reach out to your social support. You might always have to cope with your illness. But I think you can totally get to a place where it is manageable. Once you take care of the first issue, you can reassess whether an academic career is something possible (and something you still want). Don't lose hope.

However, whether or not you end up in an academic career, I think it is important that you don't attach so much of your identity and desires to it. I'll give you two reasons. First, I think it is always dangerous to be attached to a certain life-plan. Life throws us curve balls. If we *need* things to be a certain way in order to be happy, our happiness is always fragile. Have you ever read the Stoics? Try picking up Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations*. I think you'd find it helpful. Second, you don't need an academic career to find happiness. You love literature and ideas; that's amazing. I totally understand that; I've gotten much joy from philosophy as well. But you can still enjoy those things even if you don't end up in academia. There are many people throughout history who have pursued these interests while keeping a ""day job"". In some ways, academia can even make you lose joy for your subject.

Also, you're having very distorted thoughts ('I suck at everything') because you are suffering from depression. The thoughts are part of your illness. I know it is hard, but try to remember that your thinking is distorted. Make sure to bring it up to your therapist. I actually found your writing to be quite good; I can see why you like literature! Whatever you do, I'm sure you'll be able to make something good of your life. Hang in there and have hope. &lt;3",2,2020-09-14 04:50:55

g545f8r,t1_g53n2ov,True,domnedin2irrelevance,t2_82nzr8bt,"I've experienced it and Ive read about other people that have experienced it as well, and I can kinda pick up clues that point toward it. Like especially the parts about you having a tendency to daydream, being neurotic (reading into things too much), and not having many friends. Friends definitely help to keep you grounded and to give you reality checks, though you can't really use them as therapists for a long time. Also delusions don't seem nearly as neutral as the pacing or daydreaming or fantasizing. It's a feeling of being rudely awakened into some hostile reality. That hostility can seem pretty unjust at the time as one feels the are coming from a place of good intentions or just naivete. Also being good natured can cause you to reinterpret your memories and doubt your own intentions. That's why it can cause a lot of damage before you get it diagnosed with for example depression, anxiety, paranoia, and even ptsd. But if it's not hurting you or anyone else I would say forgo the meds and use your powerful fantasy/story making mind to weave together some beautiful stories and some magic into your life. Also stay away from things that mess with your dopamine receptors lol. 💜",2,2020-09-13 14:29:02
g53ji52,t3_irqkig,True,domnedin2irrelevance,t2_82nzr8bt,"You're so fucking fortunate though to be in that environment. I mean, at least for the love of literature. Most people who go to mediocre colleges or no college at all, will never realize that great human beings like that even exist out there, let alone be taken seriously by them and given genuine feedback. 
Sorry, that's just my jealousy talking because at this point in my life I don't have those doors open to me anymore. In the schools I went to the pressure was either non existant, or was overwhelming. I eventually learned that my high maintenance ass requires an environment finely tuned to my exact sensitivity to stress, and I respect that about me now.
Because of that, my experience has been unique, and deep, and colorful, and I wouldn't exchange it for anyone elses. I still have my dream of honing a craft, especially now since I actually have my own kaleidoscopic well to draw from for inspiration. But I will be genuinely happy the rest of my life if I can just read good books, do ultra lite backpacking during the summertime , and teach English to polite kids in Japan. Maybe even philosophy some day.
Anyway, you seem super sensitive and insightful, and your writing is graceful. Whatever you do, I'm sure your path will lead you out of your ""rockstar"" professor's shadow, and you will have your own envy worthy life.
As far as the sleeping and all that, yeah, definitely go to your psychiatrist and let them know everything.

It will also help you realize what triggers there are in your life and give you more tangible ways to help deal.

Also, get a SAD lamp. You’re going to be in doors a lot and missing out on sunshine. A SAD lamp can really help with that! A lot of ppl think that they are only necessary for seasonal depression but that isn’t true. The sun helps everyone’s mood especially if you have a desk job. I suggest using a SAD lamp instead of a regular lamp when working in the mornings.

Finally, make sure that you talk about everything with your peers. Sometimes outside perspectives are really really needed.

This lead her to a rant about all drugs in general, during which she explicitly told the class “don’t take anything”, referencing all medications. Then another student spoke up and expressed how anti-depression meditation has been helpful for him. At this point, she started back pedaling on medication and said the real problem is vaccinations. That’s when the rant hit. She ended class with telling us all that she wanted us to know that she is not anti-medication and anti-government. She “just wants us to know that”.

Many of us did come forward and say we were done teaching undergrad for a variety of reasons (guns in classrooms and a super-stressed student body; instances of harassment/intimidation and lack of university support for instructors; realities of a dwindling job market in academia &amp; the need to diversify resumes; poor skill fit; intense anxiety/depression; relocation requirements...). Our university created a series of non-teaching fellowships we now can apply for every year instead of the usual teaching contract. We can hold internships/jobs in community organizations and businesses, work admin roles for the department itself, or take on roles like grad advisors to undergrad publications.

Secondly, my understanding of incels is that you feel quite strongly that you've been rejected by society due to your looks or something outside of your control. It's not uncommon, especially if you've been depressed, to feel like you don't fit in. Experiencing romantic rejection can really compound that feeling.

ContraPoints (look up her YouTube channel) did a really interesting and compassionate video about incels a few years ago. She was discussing the issue that many incels are experiencing a type of body dysmorphia which is often compounded and strongly reinforced by the online communities they tend to frequent. They're essentially reinforcing very negative self perceptions in a very toxic cycle. You expect people to find you unattractive so you unconsciously seek out attention from people either in a negative way which drives them away or you seek it from people who you know will reinforce your self perception. For example, if you think you're unattractive, you may be inclined to not believe someone who tells you that you're attractive because you believe quite deeply that you're ugly. But, if someone tells you that you're ugly you're likely to believe them because you already think you are.

I'm not sure what you're experience is which has lead you to feel the way you do, but it might be helpful if you were to seek professional help. Body dysmorphia and depression are serious issues and a professional can help you find some tools not only to change your self perception but also to change the way you interact with others so that you're seeking out and cultivating more positive interpersonal relationships. A good first step might be to limit the amount of time you spend on Incel forums.

It's not an exaggeration when I say that every university in the US is facing severe financial problems. They're not hiring professors, and they're firing lecturers and adjuncts. A lot of them are significantly reducing the incoming grad school class sizes (more likely to get rejected) and you're also less likely to receive funding offers. Humanities were hit especially hard, as they receive less external funding compared to STEM.

To top this, academia is likely to face its own depression. Since almost no one is getting hired this year, next year the job market (probably not back to normal) will be at least twice as competitive, and this will ripple into future years. 

I just feel that if you're worried about application fees, you'll have continuing financial issues in grad school, and grad school is already stressful without having to worry about money... You'll worry about paying for your living, then a few more years down the road, worry about your future about how you will support yourself.

Like to brainstorm a project- 8 hours is a ton of time to have already done that. Like think about sitting for 8 hours straight and your only job is to just come up with a research topic. I think anyone, even someone who works in construction  or fast food or whatever, could do that. 

And I didn’t mean to assume you aren’t working. That is just sort of what you implied in your post given that your job was to brainstorm and after 2.5 weeks your PI is asking “you still brainstorming?” I just went off of what I have. 

And a pandemic isn’t an excuse to not work.

And I’m not even trying to imply that you’re unproductive or lazy. Reality is you probably are working harder than me. I think a lot of people work harder than me but just don’t do it the right way (granted it’s my subjective opinion).

Here is what I think. academia does not HAVE to be as stressful as people make it. Like in psychology you probably got to do like 4 pubs per year for tenure and then teach some classes. That’s it. If you do that you can’t get fired. 

You can pump our 4 easy just by doing one big ass survey and then doing a couple of projects form that one survey. You wanna study depression? Look at a survey of depressed people, their grades, social status, childhood environment, personality, etc. and you got tons of potential things to dig more into based on what your review of the literature and factors related to increased depression shows as having potential gaps. As far as classes go... I mean most textbooks come with lectures already made and you can make all your exams the night before.... so that’s chill. But most people don’t think about it this way, they assume their lecture having a couple typos is gonna make a difference in something. It might a difference k how you’re perceived? But probably minimally and not enough that warrants all the work to hand make lectures. I only choose books for my classes that come with lectures pre-made. 

I guess my point isn’t that I’m trying to be rude. I’m more saying that if you can just take a step back and say “okay, what is the most financially/career-promoting thing I can do right now?” It will actually be pretty straightforward. Thinking about having a pub that’s gotta impact factor of 10 versus 8 probably done mean much, so just go with whatever you can pump out. 

Like I know tons of people who get imposter syndrome and I’ve never understood why? Like who cares if you’re dumb as shit. You got a doctorate anda job. You’re better off than most people. Plus we all know that everyone is a bunch of  dumb asses so it’s not a big deal if another person is too. Maybe it’s a different mindset? I’m in academia now but growing up I skipped school and was down to just scribble out some homework so I got half credit. I always did the minimum amount of work to get to my goals. Like if I wanna go to college? I’d do the minimum that would still get me there. I wanna go to graduate school? Do only what I have to and nothing more. I think of education and learning as two different things. Education is a means to a job... that’s it. In the same way I think of research as a means to a salary... that’s it. That’s for me at least though.

I guess I’m just saying try to chill out and just make steady progress. No need to be the smartest prof in the bar, just gotta be “good enough” that’s it.

I think the problem of academia is best exemplified by profs who get tenure. People are always like look at prof so and so who only comes in twice per week while all the other tenured profs are working, that’s so shitty!!”

Meanwhile I’m over here like “ look at the other 10 other profs who are still working and publishing when they don’t get paid more, they’re such dumb fucks...”

I generally have a lot of sympathy for graduate students in their 30s and beyond. Being in grad school at that age is particularly depressing because you see your peers finding their places in the world, and there is so much uncertainty ahead of you. Until you get your permanent position, you literally have no idea what country you'll be living in the next year. It takes a heavy toll on your personal relationships (many of my own relationships fell apart because I moved to a different continent/country/state). In addition you make a pittance around the poverty line and you work a LOT. 

It can be done, but it's a hard road with often no rewards at all. My own personal limit was that I'd leave academia if I didn't secure a permanent position by age 30. Got one at 29, but I was definitely thinking about other options at that point, since so many of my old classmates were already making a name for themselves in the world. You should think about whether this life really is for you, and I'm not asking about the idealized starving scholar type life. This is very real.

I almost wonder what will happen with the coming 'trough' of budget shortfalls. So many of the suit's calculations were based on BAU indefinitely. With so many undergrads now suddenly reevaluating whether college is really worth it, especially with courses being online, a lot of schools are going to fail over the next 2-3 years (my undergrad put out an email to alumni that played down the risk, but reading between the lines revealed that they are seriously concerned about the long term prospects of the school - and they were up until this point pretty solid financially) 

Your Harvards, Oxfords, MITs, they'll all be fine. State schools might see some campuses close, maybe temporarily, probably permanently. But your 'regionally ranked' private schools are at serious risk of facing an academic mass extinction. Who knows what kind of knock-on effect this will have on the rest of the industry.

The obvious first result is a depression of academic wages even further than they are already. But if the loss of enthusiasm for HE becomes a trend that outlives covid, then I can see this spilling over to rest of the academic sector a well. Fewer universities and students means fewer studies (bad) which could mean more grant money available for each study (good). It could also mean that the parasitic industries that built themselves around academia - SAT/ACT, digital libraries/""publishing"" houses that charge for both access and submission, textbooks - may no longer be viable without the volume of students they've come to expect.

Now, I'm just spit balling here. There is a serious financial crisis facing schools worldwide over the next 1-2 years at least. While it will be painful regardless, there is an opportunity to potentially create some real systematic change. Off the top of my head, a 'crowd sourced' platform to submit and peer-review papers and studies may just be enough to break the back of companies like Elsevier.

As others have said on this thread, a PhD program does not get easier. If you feel like this after the first year, you very well might feel this way even more so as you go. 

If you do want to leave your program, it's generally better to do so earlier rather than later. If you leave after the first year, you can tell future employers that academia wasn't for you. No one outside the academy will hold it against you because academia isn't for most people. If one leaves after year three or when they're ABD, OTOH, it looks they're a quitter or like there was a problem. 

But don't mistake depression for wanting to leave your program. I'm not a therapist, but from your post it sounds like you might be depressed. Try to seek out a counselor to work through your thoughts and feelings before making a decision. Unlike undergrad, once you leave a PhD program, that's it. The program is finished. You also probably wouldn't be able to get into a another doctoral program if you decide later on that you want to do a PhD.

I wanted to comment, a few weeks after reading about this it felt like i was hit with a ton of bricks because it sounded a lot like me. I spoke to a psychiatrist last week and he suspected I could have ADD or worsening depression, but he would say. My question is, he said ADD, not ADHD. I think the only difference is the hyperactivity and i read that's less common in 1. women and 2. older adults. Does everyone here have hyperactivity, or do they just bundle add and adhd together? How about you?

Maybe I could gotten a nature / science paper if I could have done so. Maybe I’d be able to get more papers out if I didn’t have weekends, vacations, hobbies. 

While I keep falling into this thinking rabbit hole, I realize a bunch of things:

1) Real world impact of my work matters to me, that’s the reason I put in the 80 hours every week. These are the expectations I set for myself, if something in my life changes then I will change those expectations 
2) I need to keep doing this because it’s my work, my contribution to humanity which means that I will take the breaks necessary (weekends/vacations)
3) me pursing my hobbies is how I stay creative, it’s what fuels my work and passions so it doesn’t matter if it eats up time I could have been doing a little more research
4) I’ve spend the first few years of my PhD dealing with crippling depression, while I might not want to assign blame to this, it is a significant factor that slowed down my work.
5) Doing things which I like, mentoring, creating new programs and associations is a part of who I am. I didn’t pursue anything beyond research the first few years and I felt worse limiting myself. All my extra commitments have definitely helped me feel happy about doing stuff and being connected to people even though my depression has made it impossible for me to make new friends

My therapist suggested getting tested and to my complete surprise I checked all the boxes. My attention was at the 8th percentile 😬. Getting the diagnosis was extremely helpful because I finally stopped blaming myself. I educated myself and read literally 20 books and listened to podcasts to understand what I can do to combat it. All of that skill building helped in addition to medication. Within 6 months I made a ton of changes and was able to get my manuscript and thesis published finally. Dealing with ADHD is still a work in progress, but getting the diagnosis was life-changing for me.

Edit - This won't be relevant for everyone but a lot of the negative effects of ADHD were related to a lack of emotional regulation for me. There is a strong correlation between CPTSD and ADHD and solving ADHD alone did not infact rid me of the massive issues that come with CPTSD.

I am assuming this is a psychology study, and the BDI is the Beck Depression Inventory, and the STAI is state trait anxiety. Whether these are likely to approximate a normal distribution is likely dependent on your population. I am not a clinical psychologist, so I'm not sure how either measure typically comes out in a general population.

I usually examine histograms to examine normality, but the Shapiro Wilks test should be available in descriptive statistics under explore. Print a histogram while you are at it, so you can see what your distribution looks like if it isn't normal. You can find tutorials online for most SPSS procedures that will go through step by step

Cronbach's Alpha is under Scale -&gt; Reliability Analysis. Under options pick item and scale, and correlations. You don't necessarily need this before running an ANOVA, unless you are concerned the measure might not be reliable with your sample. Both your measures are pretty well validated (assuming you are using the full scales). 

A 2X6 ANOVA seems like a lot of variables if you have such a small sample, but it should be straightforward to run. If your 6 category variable could be reduced to fewer Again I would recommend watching tutorials on youtube. Is it a between-subjects or with-in subjects design? What is the variable with 6 groups? If you have predetermined ideas about what variables will interact, you can run planned contrast, otherwise you can run post-hoc comparisons.

gis2230,t3_kuhooh,True,HappyUIUCguy,t2_3k7fdkmv,"Let me not exactly answer your question, but explain a typical profile of an academic X.

X did well in school, better than most. X likes learning and genuinely finds their subject S enjoyable to learn about in college, high school, or maybe all the way back to childhood. During this period, they took courses on some theoretical topic S. It is clear there isn't much money in S, but who cares? As they near the end of college, their professors suggest grad school: maybe a masters to start in some cases. Why not? It's just an addition year or so? Plus there is something noble about getting a grad degree. X might even get funding to study S. Imagine that! Being *paid* to do what they would do for free! Seeing that their 20-something friends might still be trying to launch, being a grad student is no worse than most outcomes. You have a fair amount of freedom, and work towards papers with *your* name on them! That first paper is so exciting!

X decides to continue on to the PhD. I mean, it's already been a year or two, so what's another few years? X is still young, enjoys a bit of travel to conferences (paid by grants), meeting other young people in the same business (S). Those are lifetime bonds. Plus X is still 25ish, young, and has the future to look forward to. Even if it all goes bad, there'll be some industry job.

What happens next depends on various outcomes, but the general profile is this. X is doing research and doing a decent job. Yet Y is getting scholarships, more attention. This sucks! But whatever. Remember 20-somethings still haven't hit ""real life"" and can be a bit arrogant. That isn't great, but X never learned that life is like that even outside academia (X took one undergrad lab experience after another in college. They never saw ""real people"" jobs). Things don't always work well in their research. Sometimes their advisor is rough; or maybe Z said something rude to them after class. X starts hearing about all the ways academia is ""toxic"". If they are doing well, they might conclude that victimhood mentality isn't for them. If not, they might find it attractive to join the ""collective"" fighting against oppression. Surely academia has flaws, and no doubt, those flaws have affected X's success. 

 X graduates. X is late 20's, maybe early 30's. Still sort of young. X does notice that their college friends have moved on in life. Focusing on the successful friends they will notice A,B,C from college moved to \[fancy city\] with \[fancy job\]; perhaps they are married with kids. Facebook is depressing. Meanwhile X is realizing that at best they will make \~$40-50K as a postdoc at some not especially attractive location. Or perhaps X lands a really nice gig, think MIT, Harvard, Stanford -- something to write home about. In the latter case, any depression will be pushed off a little.

X's first postdoc was OK. X got called ""Dr."" for the first time, or maybe even ""Professor"". If X lands a TT job at a decent place, then you won't see them here complaining. However, most likely X will need to do a second, or third postdoc. X is getting a little long in the tooth. After 5 years of postdocing, he sees the new crop of recent PhD's, bright eyed and bushy tailed. WTF? X is now well into their 30's. Especially if X is a woman, then concerns about childrearing come to play. Was this all a racket? Exploiting *me* to get papers and work for my mentors? 

Coronavirus hits. If X thought he was screwed before, he's even more screwed now. In some cases, they might kind of know they'll score a job (perhaps they wrote enough 1st author high impact factor papers), so in those cases, X can endure. For the rest, the dream of a nice TT job (or any TT job) is fading away, but X doesn't know what to do. X has been riding on inertia this whole time.",29,2021-01-10 17:23:20
gioqpvb,t3_ktvho5,True,ahmadove,t2_2erb3g0m,"When the seed of a better possibility is planted in people's minds, they often develop a tendency to emphasize the negatives of the current choice while elevating the worth of the alternative to justify whatever guilt or repercussions might ensue from a decision to change. This is particularly relevant in high stress scenarios. It sounds to me that you feel guilty for leaving your supervisor hanging mid project, which would harm them and give rise to all sorts of inconveniences, but you're trying hard to make the option of switching to another program sound more desirable. It's important to understand, few PhD students are happy and passionate all the time about their program, especially after a couple of years, a PhD is always going to be stressful, often lonely, and even depressing for some. That's why I generally feel that, unless you actively hate your life and your project while doing a PhD, you shouldn't quit. If you just feel bored or demotivated, then try to find ways to improve.

With all that being said, if we are to assume you're not falling victim to all these biases and you're actually objective and analytical, then it still sounds to me that the PhD in Canada isn't necessarily any better. Sure it is better in terms of permanent residence, but the system there is quite different, it's usually longer, on average more independent, and often harsher with things like the candidacy exam (I'm a Canadian doing my PhD in Switzerland). I don't know which university you're talking about, but some cities in Canada are also quite depressing (UofT students for instance have quite the high prevalence of depression). Then you have the issues of starting from scratch and having lower pay (maybe even applying for your own grant, which isn't fun). The teaching, in my opinion, is not a deal breaker because it increases workload but also gives you better experience and CV (and I think they pay for it in Canada). 

I think you need to go a lot deeper with your pro/con analysis to make such a difficult decision. Dig deeper into things like the potential of each project, the personality/age/success of the PI, the group dynamic in each lab, the living expenses, the city (weather, nightlife, friendliness, etc), usual time to finish each PhD, which project/lab is better for your career goals (industry vs academia), etc...

gi8qsd1,t3_kra63i,True,jryu611,t2_d287t,"I hit your same wall.  Came to get my MA in history because I wanted to go for a PhD.  Wanted to be a professor for over a decade.  Got through my first year, then the next fall semester was rough, had to take two incompletes on research seminars.  Then this past spring, everything really went to hell.  Got my two incompletes done, but had to take another for my last research seminar.  Now, I had a lot of other stuff going on in my personal life that piled on my chronic depression, and school was another piece of the puzzle, but bottom line is I crashed and didn't finish my last paper until this past week.  I still have to do comps, so my MA has turned into the 3-year type.  I no longer want to do anything further, and I have regrets that I came in so hard towards a general history degree.  I don't even know that I would have done better going for public history, but I do wish that I'd spent more time gearing towards a teaching certification.  I basically found out that academic research is not what I want to do at all.  Coming in, I thought that it was something I could deal with to teach the classes I wanted to teach, but then I found out too late that it's too much of your primary function.  I can't deal with it.  I hate it.  I hate the idea that like, five people are ever going to read the shit, and then I have to go justify why I'm doing it beyond 'it's fucking cool shit and I can make students love it.'  I don't deal with any of that well.  Personally, all I want is to be able to distill high-minded drivel into words that normal people can actually understand and get use out of.  That's what the program has done for me: make me a bridge between the Ivory Tower's elitism and the common folk who don't understand why they should give a damn about us.  I can do that, and teaching at a university isn't going to further that goal anymore.  


Now, I came here to be a medievalist, though I really finally got into US history while here, and that's where I can answer one of your main questions (provided that's where you are).  Look at the state of the country right now, and think: there's a lot of this stuff that's rehashing of past actions that current students need to know.  The resistances to civil rights are still ongoing and still following certain old patterns.  Students still need to know that, pandemic or not.  The ways that we dealt with pandemics before are VERY relevant right now.  Students need to know that, so they can know just how fucked up their current world is.  Even globally, with the rise across many other countries of fascistic elements and right-wing nativism, there's a lot of parallels that people need to be able to understand in a historical context of: look what happened last time this popped up.    


So I agree that going into academia is useless, especially right now.  Fuck it, I've got other stuff I'd rather do, too.  But to say that history is useless right now is, uh, wrong.  It's never useless, as long as you understand what it is and how it can be used.  Every other humanity and social science needs history to exist.  But if you're looking for purpose, there's always going to be students outside of colleges that need to know truth, especially when they're living through one of those especially historic times themselves.  Brutal truth: if you're not even motivated to find a mission in the subject or a usefulness of history in these times, then maybe it's not the subject for you.  But don't feel bad about realizing that or admitting it.  It was tough for me to admit that I wasn't right for a PhD when that was my single-minded focus for over a decade.  You'll be a lot better off admitting it NOW and doing something about it and finding satisfaction elsewhere.  


And if your own research is your focus, guess what: once you've taken methodologies and done a couple grad papers, you know enough to do a damn good job researching history.  You don't have to get paid by a university to do research.  It gets easier and more accessible every day.  Besides, the way I see it, if you do research and put it in a way that the 'common folk' will care about it, you've done more to add to humanity than stuffing another 'elite' paper in a journal where five people will read it.

ghn95vp,t3_knto25,True,Fancy_Cheesecake1,t2_7ad8afhj,"Agree with the commenters below but thought I could offer a specific perspective. 

I did a contracted PhD in social sciences in Germany. I've had I would say a better PhD situation than most with the contract, as most PhDs here are funded by stipends. I've had all my various insurances etc. covered and made more take home pay than I probably would have in another program. Another benefit has been I'm entitled to Germany's fantastic health system (I won't have to pay for cancer treatment in the new year) and I can take advantage of unemployment benefits. 

Financially I would say I didn't 'lose' anything - starting salary for someone with an MA in the non academic market is probably just what I made in my PhD years anyway. 

Honestly I went into a PhD because I couldn't find a job with ""just"" an IR masters and I'm still not sure it was the best idea - things aren't looking much better with a PhD (and several internships). I don't regret my PhD as I loved my topic - if there's any regrets it's probably that if I were to start all over again and give my younger self advice, it would be to fulfil my idealistic tendencies through volunteering on weekends, and study something practical with more tangible outcomes for work. 

On setbacks within my PhD, I would say I was pretty pleased with my experience. There were some smaller issues that I've let go of - one of my supervisors wasn't an easy person to work with, and I had near constant issues with university administration (German bureaucracy!)

I'm not sure how serious you are about doing a PhD, but I think the general advice you see everywhere is true - do it if you think it's going to make you happy for a few years but maybe don't go into it with any major expectations regarding outcomes - both in terms of research and the job market. I found it super rewarding to study and contribute to a topic I am passionate about and have total control over my project and schedule.

If people would treat it like just a job, they would shrug, get over themselves and perhaps look for another job if their performance keeps slipping (perhaps in industry).

ghaqu69,t3_klmrki,True,iugameprof,t2_gugt4,"There's a lot wrong, even tragic, in this article, starting with the title. It's designed to shock, to get people to read, and maybe to spark discussion (so by those metrics it succeeds, I guess). Ultimately though, the article is about depression and suicide, which maybe couldn't be mentioned in the title, and not really about happiness, using its main character, Brickman, as a foil for the larger point the author is making.

The article begins by explicitly conflating pleasure and achievement with happiness -- this was apparently Brickman's personal lens (his personal and professional failures, impelled along by long-term underlying depression, are what drove him to suicide), and a common distractive goal for many of us, in and out of academia. The idea of ""getting ahead"" as the primary adult pursuit, and thus the root of happiness, is one deeply set in our culture. 

For academics, the idea that your value (and thus your happiness) hinges on your promotion, tenure, publications, etc., is also deeply set. We focus so much these things that we blind ourselves to the fact that this ultimately doesn't lead to being happy with our lives. When we're finally forced to confront that reality, the result is an article like this one: clearly fulfillment and happiness isn't the answer, because we pursued what we were told would lead to that and it didn't work.

I've researched and written in the area of emotions and how to model them. I eventually came back to a combination of Russell's circumplex of emotions combined with a quasi-Maslovian model (despite being told by Reviewer 2 that Maslow was ""out of fashion""). You can think of emotions arising out of motivations at each Maslovian level, where each is more durable than the one before it: so physical pleasure is great, but fleeting. Delight and similar feelings from acquisition (of objects in particular) lasts a bit longer. Feelings of friendship and familial acceptance last longer still. The positive feelings of achievement and being valued for your skills and knowledge last longer still. And finally, feelings of fulfillment we get from contributing selflessly to the welfare of others or (especially) a larger group are the most enduring. 

Each of these has a kind of built-in off-ramp: some chase novelty and pleasure, or safety and security, despite finding again and again that these feelings don't last. The same is true with those who chase wealth or the visible aspects of materials security. For each there's a hedonic treadmill, and many people never get off. The same for those who chase fame, social or parasocial relationships, or who focus their efforts on making ""a happy family."" There's nothing wrong with any of these, but they're all ultimately fleeting. The same is true of for those of us who decide that our value, our happiness, resides in acquiring and being known for acquiring knowledge, expertise, or skill. This pursuit can sustain you for years or even decades, but it too will fail. It's only when we turn outward from ourselves and leverage all the other successes we have -- wealth, relationships, expertise -- in the positive pursuit of others' good, that we find a form of ""happiness"" that actually endures. Of course, getting there is difficult, and each of these can look like folly to someone stuck on a treadmill at a previous level. (There's much more to all this of course, but this comment is far too long as it is.)

Finally, FWIW, I'm no stranger to depression, or to the value of enduring happiness. Oddly these can co-exist (IME). I certainly don't *feel* happy in the moment when I'm deep in depression. But I know that that dark night has an end, and that life on the other side of it is still good. Sometimes that's enough for me to stop worrying, stop trying to find the *cause* (itself an illusory pursuit) of how I'm feeling, and just get through it.",1,2020-12-28 16:13:50

2. Yes, there are an overwhelming amount of assholes in STEM and this is part of why many people struggle with depression, anxiety, stress, etc. to varying degrees. But that doesn't take away the fact that certain groups of scientists will experience sexism, racism, ableism, etc. \*on top\* of the regular abuse scientists experience.
3. I am speaking from what I have personally seen and heard. In my department, a disproportionate amount of our female faculty are teaching-only as opposed to research &amp; teaching, and our female assistant profs are somewhat upset about this because the department is using overall gender percentages for faculty when only a relatively small portion of the women are being hired for research. Our diversity and inclusion committee is almost exclusively female since almost all men refuse to join. Women can be held to a higher standard in teaching evaluations, which also contributes to many women feeling they need  to invest more in teaching just to get the same level of reviews as male professors. And in my own experiences, every time I've TAed a class with a male instructor and another male TA, they leave me to design the Canvas page, field student complaints, and do much of the organizational work, and students often refuse to go see them instead of me for questions because the male professors &amp; TAs are usually more dismissive. Don't get me wrong, I find teaching, outreach, and diversity work very valuable, but it definitely seems to me that it's often pushed off on women professors more than men professors.
4. The person I responded to mentioned sexist remarks, so I am including ways in which women can be disadvantaged in STEM outside of sexual misconduct.
5. I'm sure it varies by department and field. This is coming directly to me from one female assistant professor and two male assistant professors. The men have shared that the department has offered them reduced teaching loads so they can focus on research for tenure, but did not offer the female prof the same. And other senior male profs have given the two male assistant profs advice on funding opportunities, have recommended them to prospective postdocs and grad students, and have recommended them as doctoral committee members to many current grad students, all while not doing the same for the female assistant professor. And the department has on more than one occasion highlighted the male profs' work on our website and social media while only doing so once for the female assistant prof, and this is despite her and her grad students winning grants.
6. We have had a couple incidents in our department and related departments at our university where male profs are serially abusers and sexual harassers, and despite mandatory reporting, other profs don't report them even though they're aware of it and do not warn students about them. And while students sometimes therefore have to warn each other about this, I've found they're often reluctant to do so out of fear. And I have yet to see a case of sexual rumors about a male grad student or postdoc going around the way they did about this female grad student. This is anecdotal, I'm aware, but my intent in my original comment was to give specific examples I've seen.
7. I never made a comparison to another work environment or field. The presence of sexual harassment and assault in other industries does not mean it isn't present in academic STEM fields, nor does it make it acceptable or bearable.",6,2020-12-20 16:43:28

So they basically used the exact words you’re describing-that what I said was a “gray area” but nothing that is indicative of severe ADHD. I also feel like my situation with my current job is quite different than when I was in school-my current job is strictly 9-5, no hard deadlines usually and work from home also gives me some buffer when I get distracted. School was constant churning and even though I loved the concept of university, I had a strong desire to get into the real world and actually be doing something. 

I also figured personally that whatever I have would not be severe-it’s just that I have felt like even now when im doing relatively better, I’m still struggling especially emotionally because I get jaded very easily. The person evaluating me said “Normally if im doing something I enjoy, I’m able to focus and for things I don’t, I won’t focus but for people with ADHD, they can’t focus on anything”....I think she thought that described me because I mentioned time to time I can get really into things (like coding for example), but I struggle to sustain interest in anything for too long. When it came to school, some career difficulties were not in my hand (difficulty finding an internship during school despite doing everything to secure one, ultimately leading to issues finding employment in a saturated field), but like the burnout, grades, failing the exam were more in my hand and I just came to a point where I couldn’t sustain focus even when I tried studying. I figured I may have depression but even in the career field I changed in, I enjoyed my classes but once it came to work I feel like I’ve become really uncertain about what I’m doing and have thought about wanting to pivot back into my original field, although I don’t know how that’s going to work out since I have taken a long gap. My current therapist had been helpful and tries to see it as “don’t think about what others are doing/everybody has their own timeline” but I don’t think sometimes it’s as simple as that.

Of course, they didn't give me immediate attention, but they interviewed me, and led me to a group therapy session with other graduate students at our university that is 100% paid by my student insurance. The group therapy didn't cut it, so I applied to counseling services again, they led me to a psychiatrist. I've been on antidepressants for 1.5 years, and they saved my life. People told me that I would feel woozy, or I'd feel like a zombie, but it isn't like that. It just gives you enough energy and mood to be able to cope with things that are very much harder to cope without medication.

gnzw9ux,t3_lndq8r,True,Mighty-KC,t2_11ndc4i2,"I developed a drinking problem after marriage and while completing undergrad and masters degree. I used it to cope with isolation and to cover up feelings. Therapy, although I resisted, was the most helpful thing for me in the long run. 

My drinking stemmed from depression. No motivation. Alcohol, simply put, gave me motivation. It helped me through school. Or so I thought. I ended up with serious anxiety on top of depression. It was horrible. I was scared to stop drinking. Afraid of withdrawals. I was a mess. 

I finally went to an actual psychiatrist and got my meds straight and continued therapy. I’m many years sober now. I have weaned off all of my antidepressants except Wellbutrin. I’ve tried to get rid of that one but I have some sort of genuine imbalance where I revert back to needing sleep all the time without it. So I’m okay with continuing to take it so I can have a quality of life. I’m a yoga and meditation teacher. Have a wife and daughter. My practices and family both keep me grounded and well. Open communication with my wife was hard to develop but I eventually just had to become comfortable with sharing and feeling feelings. I found that many feelings I was trying to avoid stemmed from childhood experiences.

I use light therapy every day. The light is called a happy light, the one I use. I run. I take cold showers and do breathwork. Basically every day is about becoming more mentally and spiritually healthy. I and those around me are better for it.",1,2021-02-19 11:40:13

gmzdilr,t3_lhu653,True,Tyfighter666,t2_4tisom27,"For the past 5 years I have worked with some of the top experts in Suicide prevention research in psychology. I would say, being able to see things differently is very helpful. Get a foundation of theory, which you will get in school, and then start to expound on that. 
I'll give an example. For decades researches have looked at protective and risk factors for suicide. Protective factor would be something like having support from family or friends. A risk factors would be losing your job or divorce. 
But what about a belief in god or the afterlife? Is that protective or a risk?
That depends. For some people a belief in god or afterlife may be a reason they wouldn't kill themselves. But for another person, a belief in an afterlife may be a risk factor because they view this life as being bad or unsolvable and the afterlife as being a relief from pain. 
So when we use measures to study psychological phenomenon it gets complex, and being able to see that complexity and find better solutions will help you be at the ""top"" of your field.
Another example would be psychological measures. Being able to interpret statistically the effectiveness of psychological measures is helpful. There are many measures such as the PhQ9 that we use often to look at psychological symptoms. If we look at depressionf or example, research suggests that many people don't identify sadness or depressive symptoms prior to suicide. However, that myth, that suicidal individuals are depressed causes people to miss at risk individuals. In military personnel anxiety is a better predictor of suicidal behavior than depression. So if we ask 1. Are you depressed? And they say no, people often don't ask about suicide, believing that if the person is not depressed they are not suicidal.

I've only had one job (2.5 years) and I don't think I can use my current manager as a reference because it's one of those jobs without interaction (go in, work, leave) and it might risk my employment considering I'm at-will.

Swinging from states of anxiety and depression is very unpredictable and it effects every aspect of my life while my ADHD is consistently effecting my attention span. Autism is obviously not the same, but it effects every aspect of your life just the same. 

I don't take any meds and I only recently started reaching out for help because I was having severe panic attacks. The only thing I use to help my anxiety and ADHD is fidget toys.

There are some things that make me feel glad that I have ADHD though - because it's not ALL bad.

It was incredible, I never experienced anything like that before. I made it through the next term and then that summer I did nothing for 4 months. I gave myself a 4 month break and that brought me out of the burnout. I didn't work on anything during that time. I just hung out, went for walks, etc... It was so helpful. Now, I do that every year. I have 2 months marked off where I don't do anything. I just got offered teaching in July/August (which pays a lot of $$) and I said no. That's my me time.

Take some time for you. If you feel you must make it through this one term then give yourself a single goal that you believe is achievable. Maybe that is finishing the prospectus and nothing else.

As for the teaching, you do \*not\* have to put up with sexual harassment as a prof. There are so many stories of young female profs being bullied by students. It's a tough situation because the employment status is fragile so people don't want to complain. But, you do have rights and the institution has a legal/ethical obligation to make sure that your workplace is safe and free \*of harassment\* for its employees. Of course, it is 100% your decision if you want to do anything about it or not.

Finally, lots of professors struggled with anxiety or depression at some point in their career. I know some profs at the school where I work that are open about this. If there is someone you feel you can connect with in the department and let them know what you're going through, it might help.

Good luck.",1,2020-02-22 17:13:44

ffzqwpk,t3_evuqe0,True,fresnel_lins,t2_4bkvcfii,"Hi OP,

First and foremost, \*hugs\*.  I know that grad school isn't easy, depression isn't easy and having depression while in grad school just makes both worse.  But, grad school is NEVER worth killing yourself over, in both the literal and figurative sense.  (More on this later).

It's totally up to you how much you do and do not want to tell your advisor, and that depends on how strong a relationship you think you have with him/her.  I can say, regardless of how much backstory you provide, be sure to highlight what you are doing right now (therapy, different medical treatments, etc) to help address this issue.  

Then, you have to decide what you want your next course of action to be.  Do you want to finish out grad school?  If so, is taking a semester off an option? Is reducing the amount of commitments you have an option (i.e., are you teaching AND doing research AND taking classes AND serving on a grad student committee AND etc.)?

Do you want to be finished with grad school now and go out into the corporate/industry world?  Or, do you find yourself in a position where staying in graduate school is going to contribute to thoughts of suicide&gt; Then it's time for some self-love, which means getting the hell out of that situation!  What types of jobs are you qualified for based on your B.S. degree?  Do any of those interest you?  Can you work with a recruiter of any kind?  Get ready to start applying! 

Neither of these choices are easy, and we can't tell you which is the right choice for you. But maybe examining these options with your therapist might be a good way for you to work out what will be best for you.  Hope it works out either way!",1,2020-01-30 13:17:55

I don't know how your advisor will react, but the best thing you can do is to try.

I wouldn't exactly say ""depression"", but perhaps you can start drafting an email that explains you're having some health issues, you aren't feeling well at all, and that you will need some time off in order to see doctors and get everything sorted. If you can, give a very loose, general timeline of certain things you will have done in the next couple of months (I will have a draft of X to you by this date, and will prepare Y for our meeting on this date) but don't overpromise or overwhelm yourself. Just a few items to show that you hope/intend to be back on your feet within a few months. I suggest doing an email because you can spend time getting the wording how you want it, and it's a little less anxiety provoking to communicate in writing sometimes. If you end up needing a longer amount of time off, look into taking a medical leave of absence.

Then, take some time off of lab/school. Really devote yourself to getting the meds right with your psychiatrist, going to therapy, getting a little exercise, whatever.

I'm not in your field, but the best way is to first find a broad topic or question that you're interested in (for me, for instance, it might be depression's impact on marital relationships). This could come from reading the literature in general or looking at the data set that your mentor is allowing you to use. Then do a deep dive into the literature on that specific topic. Using my example, pull up every article you can find about depression and marital well being. Then you see what the gaps are. What questions haven't been explored yet at all?  Is there a research study that interested you but left you with further questions? There's your research idea (provided no one else had that question and pursued it already). 

So using my example again, you see research saying depression has a negative impact on quantity of communication between spouses.  Okay, well, does that reduced communication still involve a good balance of positive and negative exchanges, or does it move toward only/mostly negative exchanges? Is that reduced communication mostly focused on the depressed person's symptoms? Do the communication patterns return to normal after the depressed symptoms go away?

em0jo6t,t1_elyu7wu,True,MrsAlecHardy,t2_14jc9r,"I do think being with another academic was a big factor in my developing imposter syndrome.  He was just starting a PhD program and having great success at it, while I was spiralling into depression trying to face the uncertainty of the future and my own feelings of inadequacy as an academic.  I should be clear that he was nothing but supportive, but it did become unhealthy as his successes began to almost highlight my failings.  There was a lot more to it, but as I became more withdrawn he stopped sharing his successes with me, and that bred resentment on both parts.  He is also a work-a-holic (honestly, he can work 12+ hours a day with no mental or physical repercussions) and so I felt like I was never productive enough in comparison.  He pushed me to produce more, to be more focused, and not always in the most helpful way.  He worked very hard to get to where he was, and to gain the success he did, but the ease at which he impressed his new department and adapted to living abroad (which was something I had struggled with repeatedly) made me feel far less capable.  

In the end it was a very unhealthy environment for me and I've had to work very hard to regain my self-worth since the breakup. I'm lucky that I have a great academic support system, including a co-director who has worked hard to make my career a success and provides me with wonderful opportunities to prove myself.

To recap, you've been sick enough for the last two years that you have basically not been able to complete your coursework, which likely means that you do not have a strong understanding of that material. Furthermore, you are currently just starting to look for treatment; there is a very strong possibility that this means you will not be substantially healthier in the next few months than you have been in the last few years.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you continue right now, you will (i) start way behind, and (ii) likely still have the same problems that caused you to fall behind. Regardless of the reasons, be they depression or e.g. cancer, there is a very real chance that you will have the same results next term.

If the above seems right to you, consider trying to find something that will really improve your chances. One popular option is to withdraw for a term to focus on treatment (and perhaps make a bit of cash). Yes, this is annoying and expensive and might feel bad - but failing another term is probably more annoying, more expensive, and will make you feel worse. If what I wrote doesn't seem right to you, then I suggest focusing on specific evidence that it is wrong - that e.g. you really know the material, that you are *already* more effective/capable, etc etc.

Now, I don't mean ***better*** in the sense of the helicopter parent that's forcing their broken dreams onto their undeserving, innocent child. I just mean it in a very literally sense; that is you have to do better than how you did before. There are plenty of avenues for that, but it'll just be up to you to make sure you go down those avenues. 

* Make sure you're actually ready to go back to school
   * A lot of people panic about school and not going and have the crisis of ""I'm not doing anything with my life"" and rush back in. It's fine if you miss a little bit of school. It really isnt' as big of a deal as you think it may be now. Make sure that you take the time that you need to recharge and maybe go do some other things. Volunteer, work on yourself, therapy, or whatever it is that you need to do.
* Contact the DRC
   * Chances are the depression isn't something that'll stay tame while you go to school. You might have a flare, life might shit on your breakfast, or something bad could happen, so make sure you're registered with the DRC. I don't know what other places call it but the DRC is the disability office and they help students with learning disabilities or conditions to make life a little easier for them. Every place might have different options, but my school allows for flexible attendance, note-taking services, private room options, and extra time on exams and assignments. I didn't do this option when I first failed out of college, and I probably should have, tbh.
* Talk to your professors
   * I know there's stigma about talking to your professors about your situation, but I feel that it's pretty unfounded. All of the instructors that I've had were very understanding about my situation and they were really supportive (I've taken like 250 credits to my name so that's...hella instructors). Plus, all of my colleagues that are instructors are also very understanding. If they're worth their mettle as an instructor, then there's a solid chance they'll help you more than stigmatize you.
* The last thing is just be accountable with yourself. There will be times where you may not be able to do things, but you'll need to do it anyway.

ekk88fw,t3_bbo4gp,True,insanityensues,t2_6z1u1,"PhD funding is often marginally dependent on cost of living. Duke is in an area that used to be surprisingly affordable once you leave the immediate area and go towards the outskirts, but that's changed very recently, and funding is slow to adjust in academia. Private schools almost always pay higher stipends than public ones do, but the difference is negligible for expensive areas. 

Funding at Stanford, Harvard, etc., will be objectively higher, but when you add in cost of living, it equates out about the same, if not worse. Stanford and Harvard are in very, very expensive areas to live, and it's not uncommon for grad students to find living situations with other graduate students where shared expenses make things tolerable, but expect to live in an apartment with 3-4 roommates. 

For instance, I completed my PhD program in an area with a medium cost of living, with an owner's market and very high rent, but low food, utility, and transportation costs. PhD stipends were comparatively quite high, but still fell within 20% of the poverty limit for the area. Add in the ""hidden"" costs of books/materials and fees not covered by the stipend alone, and income dropped down to below poverty level. In addition, insurance supplied by the university and income on-paper often makes you ineligible for Medicaid and financial assistance. Most of my cohort took out loans, or found other departments/opportunities to work within the university and get closer to the low end of a living wage, or had partners who were not in school and made enough to support them. 

You're often bound to a contract with PhD funding, which states that you will not work outside jobs during your program. Some institutions are more lenient than others on this rule, but you'll usually sign something that states you're not going to work outside of what's given to you, since the expectation is that the university is investing in your work at the university. 

Basically, never expect that you're going to make a living wage going to a PhD program, especially in a non-STEM field. There's a reason graduate students have a high rate of depression and anxiety; financial burden as well as high workloads and expectations tend to contribute heavily. It's an expected and often unspoken condition for graduate students. 

As you're searching for programs, check the COL in the area, as well as data on funding for the program you're entering. The graduate schools will often have standardized funding appropriations that you can candidly ask for and they will reply. Add in additional fees not covered by a tuition waiver, such as parking passes, health insurance, athletic fees, books, materials, and transportation costs in the area. Look at rental company sites to determine average cost of rent, or the university's residences for costs.",8,2019-04-10 17:25:53

We lived in different cities (Perth &amp; Melbourne) and met at a conference (we had the same scholarship) in Sydney. Long story short him and I ended up talking nonstop for the rest of the conference and sparks flew.

Over the following year we did long distance, (including him being in the US for 6 months) and I eventually decided to move to Melbourne to be with him. Luckily I'd collected all my data and my supervisors were totally cool with it. 

Skip ahead to now - we've been together almost 2 years (lived together for 1) and I am just 2 months away from submitting my PhD. He finished his PhD a year ago.  I was there for him when he finished his PhD and the depression that came afterwards - it was hard. But we got through it. And now our relationship is the only reason I am not going insane in this final part of my PhD. Being with someone who knows what a PhD is amazing.

It's not always been easy - communication and knowing how to communicate your stress is essential. The hardest parts of our relationship was when one of needed something from the other but didn't communicate it. There were a lot of moments I wasn't sure if we were going to make it and lots of crying where I thought I couldn't finish my PhD AND be in our relationship. I had to go to therapy, he had to focus on healing himself. It was hard. But we pulled through and are now stronger than ever.

It's easy to get fixated on your research and thing that is the only thing that is important. I try EVERY DAY to make him feel loved and like I appreciate him and he did that with me while he was in his stressful period. Without that, our relationship would surely fall apart.

Real depression (rather than just the mood/feeling depressed) isn't something you can really ""control"" to that extent. You just suffer from it, like any other disability/disorder. Would it be nice if you could stay in a PhD program when your depression makes it hard for you to function to the required level? I don't think so, really. My analogy would be: Would it be nice if football players who were recently concussed could stay in the game even if they aren't playing at their 100%? Not really... I mean, they could continue playing and hopefully avoid big hits and make it to the end of the game and recover later. But, ultimately, it's probably better to recover first and then see about whether they can return or not or even want to.

My experience was that I had pretty bad anxiety that became VERY clear after I passed my quals with almost no issues. I got some mediocre treatment and had a really hard time finishing... I added maybe 2-3 years to my PhD.

I was in the exact same boat as you almost 10 years ago -- rejected by every Comparative Politics program I applied to despite what I thought was a decently strong application, felt directionless, and ultimately went into a depression for a few months.

It wound up being one of the best things that ever happened to me. I started dating my wife (who I never would have dated if I'd gone into a PhD program), started a career in University administration, got a professional master's with my employee benefits, and realized that a PhD program would be a bad fit after half of my wife's cohort in her PoliSci program dropped the program before completing their PhDs. I enjoyed my 20s a lot more than any PhD student I met, got my career off to a good start, and now I make more money than I would if I'd gone to grad school (this is more an indictment of how junior faculty are paid; I'll probably never make Full Professor money but I've still got ~10 years before that's a factor). I still get to work on campus and be involved with campus life, but my job market is a lot less competitive and I have some benefits (paid vacation time! no expectation that I'm answering my email after 5 PM! more career flexibility without having to move across the country!) that I'm sure most faculty members would love.

It absolutely sucks not being able to go to grad school when that's all you wanted to do and I'm not going to tell you otherwise. But not getting in was great for me in the long term and if you decide to not pursue academia as a career, then it will be for you too.

(Also if you're at all interested, consider looking at student-facing staff roles like Student Life, Residence Life, Student Conduct, Counseling, Advising, etc. A lot of institutions have steadily increasing enrollments of foreign students and are starting to emphasize hiring staff with Chinese language skills to meet the students where they are.)

If you do wind up applying in another cycle and get accepted, then the time off will be good for you too. I find (from my wife's PhD program, my Master's program, and various graduate programs I've supported on the staff side) that the students who come in straight from undergraduate struggle to balance research, teaching, and service such as they are in grad school. Students who took some time off, especially those who worked demanding jobs, tended to be able to compartmentalize better and had better time management skills.

Concerning myself with what everyone else was doing held me back for a while and caused me to not focus on myself. So focus on yourself and what's right for you now and for future you.

I mean, if people have legitimate concerns about finances, job opportunities after graduating, course load, etc., then ok, that's helpful, but if people are literally saying you're too late/old, then ignore them.

examfzh,t3_cquq9r,True,allwheat,t2_l4f43,"It's worse still than you describe. The research is never fully funded. If the PhD student is paid at all, it is only half-time, the other half is research time they either do as a part of their schooling, for which they register for credits and pay tuition for those credits, or they do the research otherwise on their own. Those credits are sometimes paid for by research grants, but not always, probably less than half the time. And PhD students often work more than 40 hours per week.  

So there is a great deal of sweat equity ownership that the student essentially gives away for free to the research, the benefits of which go primarily to the adviser and the university.  

In addition there is a large degree of abuse of graduate students, especially once they are heavily invested with their adviser and in that niche of research. After the first year or so of research, it becomes impossible to change advisers. The graduate student becomes like an indentured slave to the adviser, who holds them hostage and can tell them to keep pumping out research before they will let them graduate, or if they find anything big advisers can take the credit for themselves with impunity. Essentially it's plagiarism backed by extortion, which is often made by explicit threat against graduation. University administrators, almost none of whom have personal experience in PhD programs, don't have a clue that this is going on because they didn't go through it, professors would never confess it, and the students fear retaliation.  

Ignorance is the main reason we put up with it. Graduate students don't realized how messed up it is until they're heavily invested, which is also right when advisers strike with the abuse. Verbal abuse, psychological abuse, sexual harassment, etc. You do get a lot of PhD students dropping out, and unfortunately it's so personally traumatic that they don't do well afterwards. They feel a failure, and they don't apply for jobs with the confidence they should have. I know many people like this who ended up in menial jobs, basically some of the smartest people we have, who are now wasting away because of this system and because of abusive advisers and ignorant administrators.  

Recent studies are showing incredibly high depression rates for graduate students because of this situation. However the implicit bias of the professor-designed studies means that they have said only that good advisers are protective against depression in students, ignoring the effect of bad advisers, or the PhD system in general. A popular notion they give is that PhD programs are hard, but this ignores all the abuse, and, as you mention, also the lack of appreciation and respect garnered for their efforts via remuneration. And while PhD student pay is above the poverty line, it isn't much above it. Some get paid well enough, but many struggle to get by.

""The Chemistry of Joy"" (and ""The Chemistry of Calm"") give some great advice on treating depression from a number of different angles.

St. John's wort works great if you or down or overstimulated (though sometimes it doesn't seem to do anything at all, doesn't really matter and tea is probably a good way to go) and Valerian is great for sleep (though once you get used to it, it simply relaxes you so you can sleep or, take it with your morning coffee and feel a little more Zen throughout the day).

(2) You need to be treated differently from the ""norm.""

If you're in category (2), you should think about what sort of treatment you want, and there should be some version of this that is reasonable/feasible. Going from depression to blindness, you might say that you can't use printouts but can use .pdfs generated according to certain procedures. A general ""explanation for lack of progress"" is *not* usually a reasonable accommodation *unless* there is some reason to think that the lack of progress is temporary. Going back to blindness, it would be fine to say ""I couldn't do this because my last PI was a dick and kept giving me printouts""; it wouldn't be reasonable to say ""I couldn't do the fieldwork because the ability to drive is an absolute requirement and I can't.""",1,2019-10-03 01:08:52

If your school will allow you to do so, I highly suggest it!

What I can say about graduate school is that it will take 100% of your focus and 100% of your physical and emotional strength. If you are not ready, or not completely invested then there is a higher likelihood that you might drop halfway through and end up with no degree and a lot of debt.  I understand that you are kind of under pressure since you're already there, but it really is a big commitment that needs careful consideration.

If you decide that it's not for you that's perfectly okay! There's nothing wrong with leaving and you shouldn't feel like a failure or anything like that. Everyone is unique and so are your needs/wants. You can be just as successful with an undergraduate degree!

f0r4y58,t1_f0qzp67,True,Gemini725,t2_3u2gyd0n,"Yes, three different conflicts for three different (though interrelated) reasons...

I take responsibility for the one with the first professor. I probably did read too much into her emails and overreacted by going to the chair. However, I was hoping he could mediate and help us work it out. I thought she was disgusted with me after my research paper (which again was written in state of depression during an incredibly stressful semester), and presumed this to be the reason why she didn't want to assist with the project (and for the change in tone \[as I perceived it\]). I have an anxiety disorder, which likely colored my perceptions, but all the chair had to do was encourage communication between us. Instead, he went to the dean and also told this professor (I finally saw the record of their correspondences) that I was accusing her of traumatizing me. He then ignored my emails when I tried to rectify the situation. Others have said that it wasn't his job to mediate, but he should have told me that it would be considered a formal complaint if he got involved. (I never had an issue with a professor before that, so I wasn't familiar with how these procedures worked.)

I recall in your last reply you mentioned that I went to the campus ombudsman and title IV, but neither of those had to do with this professor. I went to title IV to challenge my rejection from their program (it doesn't meet the criteria for a title IV complaint so they couldn't do much),and the ombudsman is regarding the department chair. 

I have reported him to multiple levels of administration and now the faculty senate is looking into the matter. I feel his negligence cost me my relationship with that professor, and even though she was retiring, I hated ending on such a negative note with her. I could see how it came across that I was trying to ""get her in trouble"" or ""ruin her career,"" but that wasn't the case. 

All I did is leave the third professor's house because it was filthy. That was my prerogative, but once the chair heard I left, he prohibited anyone from helping me with housing. Had he not done that, I may not have spent over half the semester moving every few days (on the  brink of homelessness) and would have produced a much better quality paper and gotten a letter of recommendation from that professor. (The previous semester I had with her, she said she was inclined to write and we seemed to have a very good rapport.) Thus, I wouldn't have submitted that proposal with the idea of ""proving myself"" to her, and our relationship wouldn't have soured. 

So, minus the faux pas of going to chair about the emails, I don't feel I'm at fault in any of these conflicts, and I anticipate it will (at best) an awkward experience being back in that department. However, it's the only university in the city.

I first contacted the department chair, and while I was upset at that time, I was hoping that he would mediate the situation. I agree that it can be difficult to decipher the tone of an email, but I perceived it to be in contrast from her typical tone and assumed that her attitude toward me had soured because of the paper. (Having anxiety can cause you to jump to the ""worst case scenario"".) If that wasn't the case, then I think this could have been resolved with a simple dialogue. The chair, however, brought the situation to the dean's attention and escalated everything, and I then went to the dean to explain that I overreacted and didn't want any damage done to this professor's career. (I don't think most students would have done that.) I also complained about the chair's negligence and pretty much every level of administration at the University is aware of this situation now. (I'm leaving out the details for the sake of brevity but I'm not exaggerating on this.) 

I did have a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder from my physician, but I never requested academic accommodations for it because until that semester, I didn't realize how much it could impact me academically. This was an unusually stressful semester, plus I think I became too emotionally invested in this professor which also caused some of this. After that semester, I went to a counseling center at my university, and they officially diagnosed me with anxiety (and OCD as well). (I don't have a clinical diagnosis of depression, that was a response to the professor retiring/not being in my life \[and the thought of her being personally ""displeased"" with me over the paper.\]) Again, maybe I was oversensitive about it, but it was legitimately due to mental illness and not malice. Yet, none of the faculty, at least in that dept., are understanding of that. 

Also, she wasn't my adviser, just a professor who I enjoyed working with and wanted her to be my adviser had I been accepted into the master's program.

It seems that some students are able pull off high quality work at the very last minute, but I had high expectations for this paper and tried to cram a lot of research into a short time period.

The stats and the articles are all true. Those ARE the hard facts. PhD is hard, it doesn't guarantee a tenure track at all, and it will put you through some immense mental and existential crises (rates of depression are very VERY high in PhDs as you'll know). 



Having said all that, it's not THAT bleak, and overcoming hurdles in your PhD, both scientific and personal, set you up to be a great person in general. If you also take the time to assess the job market, a PhD isn't funneled to JUST academic or industry research, and you can market yourself accordingly.  



In terms of jobs:


- tenure track/academia: def necessary




- industry research: PhD will allow you to skip over the beginning grueling assistant jobs and start you at a higher position (and salary) than a bachelors. PhD holders are also preferred for acceleration in climbing up the ladder should you wish to do so. 





- biotechs: often made up of minimum MS, mostly PhDs. 




- finance, consulting (both boutique/scientific/medical and generalist) start PhDs at (near-) MBA equivalents, and having that extra degree can be very favourable. 



- non-profit: depends on the non-profit, but there are sectors where a PhD is very common. 




essentially in most jobs you'll have that ""PhD"" bonus. It's not limited to PhDs, you could get to the same level as PhDs, maybe quicker, maybe slower. But you won't be treated as a bachelors.

My main concern with your advisor was how you'd feel/react if he wasn't able to be in your life anymore.

I think even these comments were out of politeness, and may have been a hint that she wasn't going to write a letter of recommendation.

I slowly realized I simply didn't have it in me to finish the dissertation, it was a terribly difficult and painful decision but I took an MA (my second...) and left. Fortunately, I have nearly a decade of independent teaching experience - but I won't be 'in academia'. 

I don't regret it.

I do regret not taking certain actions earlier that could have allowed me to finish - but after nearly a decade, marriage, bills, age, illness... it just wasn't worth the pain and suffering academia caused me. I

I can adjunct to sate my love of teaching, I work in the education industry writing questions for standardized tests and checking them for quality and content. I'm happier. The stress is largely gone. I'm not worried about the next application for a grant or post-doc. 

The pain of the job market in this era of scarce positions in my field (political science) meant a bleak outlook while my spouse reached salaries that were better than what I'd earn. Tenure track positions are becoming rarer and rarer. Private, small liberal arts universities are going bankrupt and folding (St. Josephs recently did this near here) - and those would have been my ideal. 

Online teaching is going to replace a lot of university faculty, reduce students.... it has its upsides and downsides. For PhDs though, getting online teaching positions are hard. An MA is all you need - especially with teaching experience. Hell, having two MAs (International Studies; Political Science) may be problematic. Universities wanting adjuncts and the like are hiring MAs. Online teaching is largely being done by MAs. PhDs 'cost too much'. but there is a lot out there. 

**If you are emotionally exhausted**, then it is time to seriously consider quitting and what it would entail. You'll have to get over a lot of self-pity and pride (anyone would) - you'll feel like a failure at first. But quickly you'll realize you can get all sorts of positions with an MA, some teaching and/or research experience - and I bet you'll find something that doesn't leave you crying and emotionally broken down. Remember, a PhD isn't about intellect - it is about stamina and ambition. 

I found that my love of teaching was... less impressive than those who loved regression models. Ultimately, that environment proved toxic - and the entire discipline is the same - insular, not engaged with policy makers, talking to small audiences of others doing similar research with little effect. Always rushed to publish while teaching well... there isn't a reason to put yourself through that if it is doing this to you. It doesn't make you any less intelligent, it just means you weren't cut out for something 99%+ aren't even remotely cut out for. Hell, just making it to an MA puts you in a small category of people, being ABD with an MA is damn impressive. 

**Some bittersweet advice**. If it isn't what you need - if you really are committed to seeing it through, see a therapist and get a psychiatrist. Depression is a major problem among graduate students, as is extreme anxiety (due to our archaic system of higher education). Talk to other grad students, talk to a therapist, get on some medicine. You have to take care our you before you can worry about finishing a research project or editing a dissertation chapter. But open your mind to the possibilities if you simply take an MA and leave.

I was invited by our PI to help in a literature review that was waiting to get written for months. My part involved building one massive table. So I went and took that table to our review meeting. The postdoc asked me to help him finish his table minutes before the meeting, so in a hurry I copied and pasted part of his data in a wrong way. The PI and I didn't notice, so the meeting went smoothly, after which I left for lunch. Coming back I got told the postdoc accused me of complete unethical conduct, based on the mistakes I've made on his table. He basically said to other lab members, near our PI, that I only finished my part fast because I invented data throughout the table. I got so mad (fortunately he has a history with lying in the lab so no one believed him) but didn't have the guts to tell the PI. In the end, I don't really know if those mistakes were real or just something he wanted to accuse me of. It was my first real contribution to the group and I didn't want unecessary stress.

Jump to now, he made a sorts of emotional confession of developing depression recently, so I guess that didn't help him. From what I was told he's always been like that and our PI is aware of it but it's very lenient, including doing nothing after being told by a former undergrad she was leaving due to anxiety developed over said postdoc's abusive behaviour. I feel sorry for him but conflicted over the PI's lack of action.

This could be anything from imposter syndrome, to burnout, to depression, to working on a REALLY hard problem, to him just not being a good fit to solve this issue.   Or worst of all, he could be working on a problem that is not solvable with current theory and tech.

Working on a project for this long without results he def needs some form of outside feedback on his research as well.  He could be banging his head on a wall repeatedly when there are better methods he simply has not been exposed too.  With his lack of self-worth holding him back, he is digging a hole he may not be able to get out of alone.  He needs to bounce ideas off others and get new information and ideas into his head to likely solve this issue.  Right now he is just throwing his own ideas against a wall and expecting them to come back different.  

Finally seeking help is not a weakness but a strength.  Knowing one's limitations and blind spots is key to solving problems like this.  By not seeking help and using the social resources he has, he is not being independent, but self-sabotaging.  

But there are some bad behaviors in here that I want to say are more likely due to poor self-image and depression / burnout than his ability as a researcher.  That is why I still suggest before anything else he sees a therapist.  

Finally, not everyone should stay in academia.  Maybe his skills are best used elsewhere.  But he should make that decision with a clear mind and right now his mind is in that pit he dug with his research and telling him he is stupid and a failure.  Again, hopefully a therapist can guide him to making a decision.  

Edit:  Also I am concerned he cannot freely talk to his advisor.  This may mean his advisor is not a good fit for him.  Maybe talking with a different professor would be helpful.

My situation is different than the OP's,  but I had the experience of writing a heartfelt apology letter to a professor (I asked for a letter of rec. in this letter, but my thoughts were nonetheless sincere) and not receiving a reply. In my case, I (in an acute state of anxiety/despair) wrote to the dept. chair because I perceived some of her emails as curt. This was someone I admired, and I probably read too much into the situation etc., but at the time I felt hurt and acted impulsively. The consensus on this sub seems to be that her lack of response was because I wrote to the chair. However, (as I wrote in my posts), I was additionally worried that she was unimpressed with the research paper I wrote in her class. (I was taking it at the graduate level as an undergrad.) On top of an incredibly stressful semester, I also fell into a depression when I learned she was retiring and could not be my graduate adviser. All this profoundly impaired my concentration, and  although she generously gave me an A- on it (which gave me an A in the class), I could tell by her feedback that she (understandably) wasn't impressed.

Thus, after reading this reply to the OP, I'm thinking that maybe I was right all along, and her lack of response was because she was uncomfortable declining the lor request. It was probably some combination of both, but now I wonder if she would have responded had I not asked for a lor (or had my paper turned out better). So, even though professors generally don't ""hate"" students, is reporting one to the department chair (even in a state of mental illness and explaining to administration that you overreacted etc.) unforgivable, or does it sound like it actually was the quality of the paper that caused her not to respond? I'm not sure which situation is worse, but the uncertainty of it all has aggravated my OCD.

However, the *trait* I hate most in people in general is acting like the rules don’t apply to them — cutting in line, expecting others to make concessions because they have “special” circumstances that were voluntary, trying to get something without doing the same work everyone else had to do, etc. I’m not very fond of students who seem to have this attitude, but I don’t retaliate or mistreat them. I might be extra vigilant about shady behavior, though. 

It’s unlikely that your professor will have any reaction to you that’s as intense as you imagine. We have a lot of students over the years and it’s not normal or productive to expend that much emotion on them. Since this was not your first “indiscretion” with her, she probably does consider you untrustworthy now, and frankly I wouldn’t blame her, but there’s not much you can do now. If you ever encounter her again, just be polite and humble. Don’t throw yourself at her feet begging for another chance. 

Keep getting treatment. It sounds like you still have a lot to work through. That’s in no way an insult — it’s good that you’re addressing your issues with OCD and depression, and as you’ve probably learned in treatment, both disorders lie to you and make you think exaggerated and unrealistic things about how others view you.

People can be in a state of ignorance for any one of three main reasons IMO.

1. The person's IQ is too low to understand key concepts (uncommon but not rare).

2. The person's fact-base is corrupted/incomplete (eg: Canada is communist! Wait, what is the moon again?) This is the most common reason in lay-people (common in Fox News viewers, for example).

3. The person has a personality that doesn't lend itself toward understanding reality, eg: Trump saying that 5 million people voted illegally and he actually won the popular vote because his ego can't handle the fact that he lost the popular vote. This would probably be the most common reason for ignorance in academia, eg: a professor who is judgmental and obsessed with personal responsibility because they overcame moderate depression without medication 20 years ago and just can't accept that heroin addicts need taxpayer dollars spent on them to get them clean.

To piggyback on this, I deal with severe anxiety myself. The most stressful aspects of my masters have been my coursework, which is the same coursework the PhD students take in their first year, and an advisor who I do not get along with at all. If you can spread your coursework in a way that minimizes your stress, that may help. 

Also it depends on how you function when experiencing depression. If during a bad time you could still find solace in your work, good. Also depends on your advisor. If they’re someone you get along with great, that is immense. If they’re someone you could be honest with about this, that’s huge as well.

In my opinion, this opportunity will be available next year, and possibly even 2 to 3 years ahead. Masters are much less difficult to get into than I once thought, you’re paying them and doing work for them in the lab. In 2-3 years you would have more experience and be more competitive for applications. So if you don’t lose the opportunity by waiting, what do you lose? Time? You have to weigh that, which includes future earning potential, against the progress you may continue to make on your health.

I personally don’t find master’s stressful or challenging. Less classes, easier grading, professional atmosphere, discussion courses with smarter people. And you get to work in a lab doing actual research while undergrads do the time consuming dull tasks. It’s still busy and a lot of work if you’re involved in multiple projects but it’s manageable. 

I had depression all my life (clinically diagnosed at an early age). Not on meds or therapy since 20. And I have been the happiest since I started doing research - except a few occasions I had some personal problems. I honestly feel better the busier I am. I thrive under stress lol however, I feel really depressed when I don’t have much going on, just sleeping all day and not leaving the house for days. It’s like working in an area I love makes me forget about everything that sucks. 

So based on my personal experience, I’d advise you to seriously consider this opportunity. But eventually, you know yourself better than anyone.

&gt;I also don't think it serves much purpose to compare American universities where you pay in excess of $150,000 dollars to European universities which can give you essentially the same education but for next to nothing.

You typically don't pay that much in the US either, once scholarships and aid is taken into account, hence why the average amount of student loan debt per debtor is only around $20,000 for a four-year degree.

All my peers are in serious grief right now over losing a pivotal part of their young adult lives, with no guarantee of a secure future. I think that my professors who have handled this best have done the following:

- They didn't mince words. This sucks. This is really, really terrible. Don't say it's a challenge, a difficulty, a bump in the road. I know fellow students who are homeless, who are going back to abusive families, whose visas are going to be revoked, etc. Saying that this is a little bit tough sounds patronizing to us, as well as uninformed.
- Instead of starting off with advice, they asked me how I was, if I was okay at home, how my family was, how I was feeling, so on. One professor of mine asked us to, if we were comfortable, write her a brief 'oral history' about how we feel right now, for her own knowledge. She asked us what we've lost, what we're angry about, and what we're thinking about. I thought that was nice, and used it as a space to basically dump out all my feelings. Another professor had a Zoom call with my class and let us use a whole lesson to talk about how we wanted to move forward and how we were feeling. We showed each other our pets and our homes and talked about how reading the news was depressing and scary. She gave us some good tips, helped us laugh a little, and sent us some friendly emails after it was over.

I promise you, OP, if you write an email that's filled with platitudes and distancing, your students are either not going to read it or are going to read it and be pissed. We're humans, and we all have relationships to one another. Be authentic. Be kind. Don't tell people to find the silver lining, because for many of us, there is none. Don't tell us to make the most of our 'free time,' because a lot of us are fighting depression and isolation. Yes, if you want to share things that have helped you, that's fine, but you have to make sure it doesn't come off as preachy. Instead of saying ""make the most of your time"" or ""go outside every day, call someone every day,"" you could say ""I've been finding that, for me, sewing has been a really nice way to take my mind off things for a little while, and I'd be happy to send you all some templates if any of you are interested,"" or ""I thought this podcast was pretty funny and I listened to it while I took a walk outside, maybe it'd help you too.""

Warning your PhD and other postdoc PI about this lab is an excellent idea. ""Ruining"" this PI's reputation is the old school method of dealing with it...with limited success. So if you get to interact with 1st year students in your dept, flat out tell them this PI is abusive and not to join his group! That circulates fast and gets perpetuated year after year -- I recall a certain prof my 1st year cohort was warned off of by many students.

fb65bhn,t3_ebjwt1,True,MelancholyBeet,t2_1vhmsbbe,"I was worried about having a similar convo with my PI, but I wasn't in a toxic lab environment and my PI is good person who deeply cares about the students they mentor.

I assumed my PI would be unhappy about my career plans, but I was wrong. They offered to help in any way they could, and were happy to have a student who could set an outside-of-academia example for future group members.

It doesn't seem likely that your PI will care at all about why you are making this decision; they will only see how it affects them. They probably won't care why you are disengaged, either, nor be kinder to you once they know why you've been ""slacking.""

If I were you, I'd keep my head down and work only as hard as necessary to keep the PI off my back, while finding other opportunities asap. **I would not tell my PI why I've been having trouble, or that I'm leaving soon. I would not ask for or count on a reference letter from them.** If necessary, I would tell future employers that a reference letter from that PI is not possible because they created a toxic lab environment and were abusive. (Maybe others disagree on this point but I think these mofos need to be called out in every possible way. Read up on [John Brady](https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/education/university/toxic-lab-lasted-for-years-uw-madison-had-little-idea/article_199b0616-a558-5da5-b214-4896154ceecc.html) if you disagree.)

You don't owe this kind of PI anything. You didn't say it, but how much has this work environment contributed to your depression? Honestly, if I were you I would get out as soon as possible, papers be damned. If you feel like you need papers for your next career move, perhaps switching labs could work for you. I would also talk to higher-ups within the university about this PI's behavior. They might help you get out sooner, navigate the reference letter issue, and find solutions you are overlooking.

One more note. You wrote:

&gt;I could easily ask my PhD advisor and past PDF advisor and other colleagues for reference letters (which they have offered to give knowing what is happening in my current job) 

So, these other faculty know what's going on in this PIs lab...and what are they doing about it? This type of environment is NOT OKAY and should be addressed by the university. Since these faculty are already your allies, I'd start by asking their advice for your situation, and then seek their help in reporting this PI's behavior.",1,2019-12-17 00:15:57
fb381xw,t3_eb4gcw,True,zclement,t2_3gtvrkny,"I was making a similar decision a while ago, and here were some factors in my decision:

I felt like a psychiatrist wouldn't be as ""involved"" in treatment as a therapist would be. I felt like being a therapist would be more rewarding because I could see the therapy I was doing directly changing my client's cognitions. With psychiatry, it seemed like I would just prescribe people a drug and not see them again. 

Also, if you're treating someone with depression, it's almost more important to prevent future episodes than to stop the current episode because depressive episodes tend to only last 6-9 months untreated. Psychotherapy (especially CBT) is good at preventing future episodes. So for depression at least, it seems like psychotherapy is a better option. 

I also did better in my psychology class than I did in my chemistry class during the time I was making this decision, so I decided I would probably do better in school as a psychologist rather than a doctor. 

One other thing—psychologists can have prescribing privileges in some states (I think New Mexico is one as well as a couple of others) so there's a potential to do both kinds of things.

Also, there are more ways to improve people's lives than being a psychiatrist or a therapist. You could work in organizational psychology, for example, and make people have less stressful work environments to stop them from developing depression and anxiety in the first place. Or you could do research on early intervention strategies (which is what I am hoping to do right now).",1,2019-12-16 03:20:23
fail2bk,t1_fahyl4t,True,OizysAndMomus,t2_2vaw3phu,"This is actually a very under diagnosed and not uncommon serious problem.  Doctors are too often dismissive of abnormally heavy menstrual cycles that cause chronic or transit recurring anemia.  In women such issues are also more commonly diagnosed as depression or behavioral issues without ascertaining that there is a primary medical cause.

You need to see a gynecologist , not the health service on campus, you need to be clear and demanding that they deal with the problem.  The treatments are basically progesterone or birth control pills (so be clear that those did not work) uterine ablations or D and C or in the worst case scenario a hysterectomy .

Seriously get it taken care of - the chronic anemia can damage nerves and  other tissues.

This is not a behavioral issue.  You can not control the hemoglobin staturation and there is no life hack for making it better.  Taking iron pills will also not fix the problem (although necessary) because you have a deficient amount of red blood cells, not a deficient amount of iron.

So why doesn't this fail?  I create assignments that always require exactly that: students must analyze and integrate material from the readings, the lectures, the small group discussions, the data/sources we worked on in class, etc. It's an explicit requirement of my assignments, so if someone just submits some generic ""Here are 2000 words about the Great Depression"" they would at best earn a D.

facl1oe,t1_fabv9z0,True,Gemini725,t2_3u2gyd0n,"&gt; for someone so incredibly obsessed over the tone others display in their correspondence to you, you really lack tact when it comes to tone in your own correspondence. Glass houses, and all. 

Fair enough, and I appreciate the insight. As I said, these events were fresh when I wrote this, I hadn't adjusted to not having this professor in my life (to the extent that she could be considered in it). 

&gt; This comes across very much as ""I am such a kind and generous person that I would be willing to overlook their transgressions and bequeath upon them my most esteemed approval"". 

While my evaluation was sincere , after reading your reply, I can now see how it could come across this way. (This is another reason that the chair should have invited to meet with me in person.) If I had read an email like this from a student \[when I knew they admired the professor\], I would have perceived them to be upset \[not angry or vengeful\]. I would have offered to meet with them in person  (thereby giving them time to calm down) and asked them what it was they wanted out of the situation etc. Although I now see where it may not read this way, what I ultimately wanted was to know that my rapport with the professor (as I perceived it) had not soured. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yeah, they should. It sounds like you didn't really have a strong case for an extension and the professor probably had to deviate from her own policies in order to grant it. Expressing her displeasure at that fact is her way of saying that you shouldn't expect to get any more special treatment, or to make a habit of milking your situation. 

You're right. I didn't make a strong case. (I didn't even give her an explanation of why I wanted the extension,  but she did know that I had changed topics late in the semester and went through the housing stress etc.). The truth, however, was that I was experiencing an episode of depression over her retirement/not being my advisor, but I couldn't  tell her that as her student.  I was looking forward to working with her more closely and getting to know her better etc., and while I appreciate her telling me why couldn't advise me (it would have been worse if she had said no without an explanation), I fell apart after this. 

Also, regarding her expressing dissatisfaction, I suppose it's reasonable for a professor to express such sentiment in a case like this (asking for an extension at the last minute.) However, there's nothing that could have hurt me worse than her being ""displeased"" with me. (All I wanted was her approval.)  I also felt she was expecting more from the paper (not knowing about my depression episode), and I felt like an utter failure afterwords . It wouldn't have been such a ""traumatic"" (for lack of better word) experience with another professor, but she was so important to me that I couldn't handle any disapproval or rejection from her. 

&gt; You had two classes together. You have no right to be so attached to her after such short time, especially given all of the examples you've outlined that *clearly* show she didn't feel the same way. You were a student to her, no better than any other and held in no higher regard than every other student she's ever had. You were not special to her. You are not special to her. 

In a way, this actually makes me feel better. I wouldn't be able to handle knowing that I hurt her if she actually did reciprocate my ""feelings."" However, it's easier knowing that I probably didn't mean as much to her as I thought. At the same time, imagine making someone your entire world and investing all you energy in them etc, only to find out they didn't care that much about you. I hope she at least thought I was good student, but I knew that she probably didn't even think that after the paper I submitted. 

This also leaves the question of whether she would have wanted to stay in touch with me had none of this happened and had I submitted a perfect paper. Honestly, even under those circumstances, it still would have been difficult for me not having her in my life. And working with another advisor still would have been painful (though maybe slightly easier if I was still in contact with this professor).

After writing all this, I realize how ridiculous this whole situation is,and hopefully I'll eventually get over her and continue with my education. 

Re: the chair, even he thought I wanted a formal complaint filed, once I explained everything to him, I thought I should have been allowed to reconcile with the professor. I wanted her  to know that I wasn't acting maliciously but that my anxiety had gotten out of control. (Maybe she does know.) 

Re: my comment about being inspired by her work, I can see how it could have come across as insincere. However, a book she wrote genuinely did help me with an aspect of my anxiety  (and was a fascinating/intriguing read). I shouldn't have asked for the lor in the same letter, but again, my anxiety was out of control at the time and I became ""frantic"" for reassurance that she still approved of me. 

In any case, thank you for the response. The realization that she probably wouldn't have wanted any type of relationship with me even under the best circumstances is helping me. (In other words, I didn't lose anything.) I still would have liked to end on a more positive note with her, but maybe she wasn't invested in me to begin with, so never cared about the situation as much as I did.",1,2019-12-10 01:33:56

faapy2e,t3_e8clrs,True,LikeChewingGravel,t2_z5zqf,"A few questions/suggestions from someone who's done the med school admissions process: 

&amp;nbsp; 
1. Your grades: do you have a consistent trajectory upwards after your depression was diagnosed and treated? If so, the situation isn't as bad as you think. Many medical school applications have ""anything else"" sections for this express reason where you can explain blips in your record. Shit happens sometimes. 

&amp;nbsp; 
2. I don't know how a MSW works or if it'll allow you to complete the necessary courses without too much stress/stretching, but I would consider looking into post-bach programs. They're programs that are literally designed to do what you want: take people who majored in something   non-traditional for undergrad and help you get the requirements for med school. Many of them also help with MCAT prep. 

&amp;nbsp; 
3. Knock the MCAT out of the park if you can. It's intended to standardize across difference institutions because bio at one university may be easier than another. If you do really well on the MCAT and explain the blip in your academic record, most admissions committees will overlook that and at least grant you and interview. 

&amp;nbsp;
4. When discussing/explaining your depression on applications or in interviews, I wouldn't name it as depression. I'd call it something like ""a flare up of a chronic illness"". Yes, the stigma shouldn't exist anymore, but it still does unfortunately and depression is and should be treated like any other chronic illness. 

&amp;nbsp;
5. A little off topic and definitely not meant to be discouraging, but I'd also consider why you want to be a physician and whether than can be achieved through working as a clinical social worker. As someone who practices medicine, often times social workers can make a much bigger difference in a patient's life than I can. Our medical system is very broken right now and if you're looking to make a difference in people's lives, you may be able to achieve the same goal with the path you're currently on and get to it faster. You can still see patients as a social worker and often SW gets to spend far more time with patients than I do.

Expect to present sufficient evidence to justify your case/position. If you had good grades toward the early part of your career, you have a good case to make. Getting academics/faculty to back you up may also be helpful, if there are any you can call on.

If you are planning to go into academia, it can easily be more than three changes as you are forgetting about changes for post docs and faculty positions as well. The problem isn't simply the breadth of experience either, it's also about job openings. Say you go to a specific school to learn from an expert about a specific area of your field, then that means that school already has an expert in that area (i.e. the person that trained you) and in most cases, they would prefer to hire someone who is an expert in an area that they don't already have.

In my first experience with university email, I remember freaking out because I didn't know if I was supposed to put a kiss at the end or not. And more commonly used methods of communication like Messanger and Whatsapp don't require ""signing off"". They happen in real time and once you're done talking, you just stop talking.

I also remember getting frustrated that I would get emails from professors that required a response, and that response might take me 3 hours to write, even if it was just a couple of sentences. It frustrated me that they didn't understand just how much of my time they were wasting by needing me to respond in a way that sounded as good as how they wrote. I was always so worried about what they would think of me. It might take a whole day of my headspace just to write one email. (and yeah I had depression and anxiety too).

Five years later, all of my professors (but especially older ones) took issue with it. ""If I write you an email, you have to respond! Why aren't you responding to my emails? What is with you kids?! Grumble grumble!""

By the time I was in grad school, teachers wouldn't even write emails, and instead interacted with us only on blackboard.

So, sure, I think depression/anxiety could be part of it. But I also think it's the product of an age gap. I think for most undergraduate age students today, email is a communication method of last resort.

There are so many other, flashier, more convenient social media outlets and chat apps that they are constantly checking. So many different avenues of conversation other than email, and those other avenues are prioritized. To me, email is just as valid as, if not more valid than, any other option.

I have severe depression and generalized anxiety disorder and I reply to my advisor’s 3am emails within an hour. 

It frustrates me very much when professors (especially advisors) don’t reply to my emails, and I’m so glad to know that there are professors out there who actually do want to hear from their students.

I don’t think it has much to do with anxiety or depression in undergrads case, not in general at least. My impression is that undergrad classes are usually huge and not exactly committed or specialized, meaning undeclared majors etc.. So the email inquiries about extra credits might be just them being curious about how hard it is to get an A in this course etc., and when they realized it’s a bit too much for them they just stop responding (maybe in some cases because they don’t know how to say no to a professor?), and move on to other aspects of the “vibrant college life”, or other deadlines.",1,2019-11-26 12:47:53

I started analyzing and playing with the data, which for the type of thing we do, it takes forever. I focus on getting a grant around march/april, i helped my supervisor with a huge paper of which im one of the authors (though position like 5).

I got in a lack of motivation/depression/anxiety/etc. loop for a while and just a week ago i had a change of heart, in my case, in my area, way more important than having a paper is being able to show that i can do the experiments i do, and to show that i can have a project from start to end. So from one day to another, i decided to do more experiments, acquire more data, and become proficient in this techniques.  
Thats at the end what Grad school is about, to learn, not to be doing papers and grants for our supervisors (although i know its becoming more and more competitive).

i'm an undergraduate at a sort of rigorous school. we're on the quarter system, and are recommended to take 3 classes at once / per quarter. each class is usually 5 credits, 15 credits a quarter. people can and do take more but i haven't because it's definitely still hard and i can tell that if my workload was heavier it would be hard for me to have the social life i wanted, and the stress would probably worsen my depression",0,2018-08-27 06:01:40

My quals were designed to be purely written. I aced one set of quals but was marginal on the second. I had to do an oral presentation to my advisor and other members of the department to get approval to proceed to the dissertation stage. 

I ultimately passed the second time, but it was a major blow to my confidence and I thought about quitting when I heard what I would have to do. But I knew, or thought at the time, that if I left, I would probably not be able to work up the strength to go back. I can't explain how I did it, but I did the oral presentation, passed, and proceeded to the dissertation stage, passed that, and got the PhD.

Beyond the psychological barriers, you should consider the job market. I'm not an economist, but I work closely with the economics department at my university. They are an R3 undergrad-only program at a regional university, and whenever they have a job opening, they get hundreds of applications, some from places like Notre Dame, University of Washingtob, Rice, etc. Getting back into an economics program might be difficult if you're competing with people who are fresh out of undergrad. 

One thing that helped me immensely in grad school was seeing one of the student therapists in the psychology department's clinic. Most schools have these programs and run them on a sliding scale. In my case, it was $8.50 per session, and the quality was actually pretty good.

Neither of them went to university, so they were always quite patient with my stress. In grad school, I would explain to them why I was so upset over certain things, and they would always remind me of the ""little"" things I started to see as unremarkable. For example, I was really stressed in my third month of my MA because I was in a toxic cohort and the negative aspects of competition really got to me. My parents reminded me that, hey - it's awesome that you got into grad school. That is still a really big accomplishment in and of itself, regardless of it you get X funding, publish, etc. 

While they may not entirely understand certain kinds of pressure (like the pressure to publish, get tenure, get funding, etc.), they are really good at reminding me to take time to be proud of myself. That is something I lost at first, because I felt major imposter syndrome. To me, it was no longer impressive that I had X funding because it wasn't SSHRC, and I wasn't impressed with myself for being in grad school because everyone else around me was. But to them, it was still the most awesome thing. That was really, really nice to hear sometimes. 

It took a long time for my parents to understand how to deal with my stress in other areas of my life, though. For a long time they would get frustrated that they couldn't just fix whatever problem I had. So I actually stopped telling them when I was upset/stressed because it made it worse. One day I finally just sat down with them and explained what depression was, how it affected me, and how they could support me.

e2yafkj,t1_e2y4ckz,True,medphyswhiz,t2_1tyn05gm,"I agree with dataispower and khosikulu. I nearly dropped out of my PhD because of my anxiety which caused temporary depression. My anxiety was so bad that noises and hearing people talk would trigger panic. I would have to reread paragraphs 3 or 5 times and couldn't retain anything; I started to think I was somehow stupid. It took me a day to write a paragraph. I dreaded every task. And every task caused stress and anxiety, even answering e-mails.

I spoke to my advisor (I realize not everyone may have an advisor as understanding as mine) about my stress and he told me to take things slowly for a while. I immediately started seeing a counselor and many sessions focused on cognitive behavioral therapy. At the beginning, I just vented because I had bottled up 2 years of stress. I saw my counselor weekly for the first 3 months, then bi-weekly for 6 months, and now monthly for mental maintenance. The first 6 months, I took weekends off, I left the office by 7pm, and I didn't do any work from home. My depression went away completely after 3 or 4 months. 

Now I enjoy going to the office. I've written my first first-author paper. I've written my research proposal for my candidacy/qualifying exam (this was a tremendous achievement for me!). I can read articles without needing to reread paragraphs nearly 5 times. In fact, most of the time, I enjoy reading. When I come across an article that I'm not understanding, I go back to the abstract and I try to at least focus on 2 or 3 takeaways from that article. Then maybe months from now, that article will make more sense. I've learned to be comfortable with my progress and I have realized that research is a process. 

I realize not everyone in my situation may be able to take things as slowly as I did but I recommend that you at least see a therapist somewhat regularly. And I recommend that you schedule time off each day. And I would go as far as to say that you should have one entire day each week in which you absolutely take a break from all work-related things. 

One last thing, I learned that my anxiety stemmed from childhood issues that I had tried to suppress. Often, stressful enviroments can uproot these issues. Anxiety can also be a situational thing so I'm not assuming what happened to me is true for everyone. The point I am trying to make is that a therapist can help you discover the root of your issue so that you can come up with longterm solutions that work for you.

e2vlkrf,t3_88ip6n,True,ryneches,t2_idi5a,"I finished my Ph.D. earlier this year. I was very, very productive and had a wonderful time... until my last year. Then my confidence and energy crashed. Even though all the scientific work was behind me, the prospect of writing up the last piece flung me into crushing depression. The reasons were complicated, but it was mostly a combination of not wanting to leave a lab I loved, and overwhelming anxiety about what comes next. Unfortunately, my advisor got swamped with some Really Important Stuff right at the same time, and so we both kind of flailed around helplessly.

Three things that would have gotten me through faster and with less pain :

1. Help tee-up some opportunities for what comes next. Even if they didn't pan out, just knowing that I didn't have to do the job hunt alone would have dialed down my anxiety about it -- even if I was actually doing most or all of it myself. I spent a lot of time unnecessarily worrying about whether each opportunity would be a good fit. Just hearing, ""Sure, I don't see why not,"" or ""Why don't you get in touch with so-and-so?"" would have made me feel less helpless.
2. Don't talk about writing a dissertation. Don't ask for chapters. Ask for chapter sections, figures and tables. Maybe ask for them as blog posts, and then formalize the language and smooth out the transitions in a later pass. When I couldn't knock something out in a single sitting, the gaps in between writing sessions turned into abyssal depths of chittering horror. Conversations about ""structure"" and ""narrative"" made me feel like I was falling forever. So... focus on smaller pieces.
3. Ask what decisions the student wants you to make for them, and at least reason through what would happen if you did. It's fine to say no, but then you'll see where they are getting overwhelmed.

That senioritis feeling is almost always a thin shell of cynicism around whole lot of anxiety. When you're suffering from anxiety, a token amount of job hunting, or writing, or decision making can feel like a lifeline. In practice, though, it functions more like a challenge. It could be a single sentence in a single email, as long as the substance of it is, ""Here, let me help a little bit."" The reaction will be, ""Oh, we're facing this problem together.

I've dealt with depression for the last 6 years and my memory has somewhat eroded since, as well as my ability to concentrate. I can't seem to plan out my essays in a way that is systematic.

For my current essay I have written out some topics to address throughout but can't seem to choose the most structured and intuitive order. I began by attempting to write the intro -and thesis statement- and became really bogged down, touching on too many threads, hoping to congeal the essay idea but failing to find any focus. 

I think this is partially down to the complete lack of confidence I have in my own ability. I would have said when I was younger that I was relatively bright, curiousm and engaged in school.

It generally makes us feel more isolated and less willing to share with people, and I think those are the seeds that can grow into work-related depression and anxiety for a lot of students. 

That being it said, it does happen. I wrote a seminar paper in a course that a professor said was the worst thing he'd ever read. Six months later, I found the argument in a journal.

It also depends on the value of the idea- I see people publishing similar stuff to me all the time, but my unique perspective ultimately means we have two very different papers. I take it your in STEM, but even in the humanities, something like 60-70 percent of a paper isn't me. It's all the other people publishing in the field.

But you can also take things you learned from this experience into the next one. You already know this, but proactive communication goes a long way.

And a list of things I needed to ask and know about them. I have some complicated anxiety/depression and my impulse is always to withdraw, so I have to make a deliberate effort (and push through terror) to ask questions and follow up on bad experiments/failure.

Everyone said don't do it, but they thought they were different and could make it work. Nope!

OP, your situation is difficult and I really feel for you. It sounds like you shouldn't try out this current rotation you have set up given your situation; the advisor is essentially telling you that he'll take your free work for the rotation but won't pay for you in the long term.

I’ve gotten absolutely nothing done in the last two weeks. Have hardly even been in to the office. Feel like my brain just doesn’t work sometimes and I don’t even want to look at my work cause it gives me bad anxiety.

That’s being said, I’m not sure what the solution is. One thing for me I know I need to do is ask for help. It’s really hard for me at this point because I’ve been here so long so I feel like I should know these things already and it holds me back from asking for help because I’m embarrassed. But I know I’m not going to get anywhere if I don’t. Do you have other grad students or post docs you can ask for help?

I’m not sure how honest you should be with your advisor, it’s depends how they are. Do you think they’d be understanding? I think in general most advisors have seen this before. So many grad students suffer from anxiety and depression that keeps them from being productive. At the end of the day your advisor just wants you to graduate. And being honest with them might get you the help you need.

e1ayzfj,t3_8tucg7,True,iyzie,t2_83m6x,"Why do we tie our work ability so closely to our self-esteem?  Because  for many of us who can identify with what you've written, low self-esteem is the core problem.  Our academic careers are motivated in part by over-achieving to try and mitigate the feelings of low self-esteem.  But as we get older we start to see the flaw in that plan: no matter how successful we are in academia there will always be failures, because we chose to work on something truly difficult.  The tempting cure for the depression of failure is renewed ambition and desire to be even more successful and transcend these problems; but those ambitions also set us up for the next round of failures.  If we don't try to cultivate a sense of satisfaction then we will never be satisfied.  

I learned this from watching an esteemed senior scientist give a bitter talk that went too far in putting down competing research groups.   He had announced a breakthrough ""coming by the end of the year"", but that was now two years ago and the other groups beat him to it.

eajh7jj,t3_a0ox7s,True,GWFKegel,t2_gctui,"This is going to sound harsh, but hear me out: Evaluate him as a partner as he is *right now*. Can you live with this man as he currently is?

If he can't make changes for you now, he's not going to make them. Academia is a game of delayed gratification. We're indoctrinated into feeling like ""the next step"" will be better than the last, so we don't have to take care of things *in this step*. ""I'll be less miserable when I graduate."" ""Things will be better after I get tenure."" ""After this grant application cycle, it should be smooth sailing ..."" ""This promotion would really help our stability ..."" But that game is unwinnable. *This moment* is exactly what life is.

If he's willing to meet your needs now, and if he can change things to where you enjoy your life as you're living now, then I'd say give him the benefit of the doubt. But be very cautious if he's saying he can't do things because he has to get tenure (or the promotion to full professor, or the next grant, or next-something-else). Tell him you need him now. And tell him that it matters to you how your relationship is now. This is crucial. And it needs to be direct so that you can see how he responds. Don't be afraid of him giving you an answer you don't want. He's going to answer implicitly through his actions, and if it's negative, you're just going to dwindle away in bitterness. Have courage. Be direct. Confront this now. You stand to gain way more than you will lose if you don't.

If you look around academia, very few professors have good marriages. ~~Most~~ Many have been divorced (some multiple times). The odds are stacked against you. (This is also the case in many other competitive fields like law and medicine.) So realize it's going to be a fight. And you need to learn to fight this now because it won't go away.

Now, I'm *not saying* to be short-sighted and never cut him slack. If he's really trying and giving you what he can, and if it seems like he has a *tangible, date-specific* plan for when he can help you, then realize academia is tough and he's trying. But, given that you mentioned he's not into counseling, that doesn't bode well. If you need more, demand more. In your own counseling sessions, start reflecting on what you need from a partnership. And then start the process of thinking whether he and his situation can meet those needs.

On a personal note, my wife left me in grad school. And I even *made* time for her, and I initiated counseling. But it wasn't enough to save our marriage through the stress of academia (and who it makes me) and her feeling like she was letting her life slip by. This is real shit, and academia can eat even strong couples alive. After she left me, I went to counseling and tried to take care of my (until then undiagnosed) depression and anxiety. I've realized how, even though I was a good partner, I had stuff I had to work through. I'm in a new relationship now, and it's made me a more caring and open partner. But my girlfriend now knows exactly what she's getting into, and we talk often about what we want and whether the relationship is working for us. I've also cut back my research a lot, and I'm striving for simplicity.

The point: start to work on this *now* because, frankly, the journey is just as important as the destination. And if this relationship is meaningful to you, fight like hell to save it. But don't fight harder than he will. You gotta take care of yourself too. The world needs who you are too. And you don't have to be a martyr. (I know too many women and people of color who feel like they must be.)

Much love and empathy for what you're going through. My inbox is open if you have more personal concerns you don't want to say openly.

**Edit again**: /u/lalochezia1 Provided actual data on divorce [here](https://qz.com/1069806/the-highest-and-lowest-divorce-rates-in-america-by-occupation-and-industry/) and [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1-JVVCiuXBZEpU6_5HsZLYyblVClpEW0ucYBafkNbaYI/pubhtml), with the upshot that academics are in the middle of divorce rates. They're not actuaries (with the lowest divorce rate), but they're not bartenders either (with a high divorce rate). I corrected my above statement to say ""Many professors have multiple divorces"" (instead of my original statement that said ""most professors"").

Also, my remarks are based on anecdotal evidence. My undergrad, which is a teaching university, had one faculty member (of about five) who'd been through divorce, one who never married, and three in marriages/partnerships of varying degrees of normalcy. But when I went to R1 schools, I met many people who had multiple divorces and rocky marriages. Also, the topic of relationships in academia is written about a lot. See: [""Why Does Graduate School Kill So Many Marriages?""](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-Does-Graduate-School-Kill/244796) and [""The Dual-Career Divorce""](https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Dual-Career-Divorce/44911) and [""The Postdoc's Dilemma: When to Give Up on Romance and File for Divorce""](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/postdocs-dilemma-when-give-romance-and-file-divorce).

Yes PhDs should be tough, they should teach you how to manage and handle stress and failures. Cry if it makes you feel better. In fact, it's healthy to cry and deal with your emotions.

But most universities (at least in the US) have some sort of student counseling center that is cheap or free for students. Go there. Get therapy. The university where I went to grad school even had therapy groups specifically for grad students, if that’s your kind of thing. Student counseling centers vary in quality and resources, but even if yours isn’t particularly well-staffed or high quality, it can be really good to get some help dealing with anxiety. 

Second, look into other resources your university offers for grad students. Mine had a graduate writing center staffed with advanced grad students who could help with any step of the writing process. They also lead workshops and such on writing, which were really helpful and a good chance to connect with students in other departments who were struggling with writing in ways very similar to how I was.

Finally, I would encourage you to try and socialize with other students in your department, if you can get yourself to do that. Your grad school classmates can be important allies in dealing with the ups and downs of your program, and I guarantee that many of them are going through struggles similar to yours— what you wrote sounds so similar to my grad school experience and that of many of my friends from grad school. It’s really hard, and it can be incredibly isolating. Being totally isolated from social connections can make things so much more difficult.

What you should not do is dive into a PhD feeling like this, because it is hard enough as it is. There is nothing wrong with taking a longer break for a couple of years to do some self-care and reflect on what you want to do.

I made so many little mistakes and lost my train of thought so much during those first six months. The next six months are a lot better, but still challenging.

Second, post-partum depression is a thing.

The latter is a specific career question, the former is an existential crisis, and for some reason you seem to think that answering one will also answer the other. I think your lived experience shows that this is not the case. Why do you think that working at the World Bank or the WHO will make you feel useful? It will be more paper-pushing, just under a different boss, which may or may not be useful to society, but given you've been doing it for ~8 years already and you hate it, I don't see why you assume that it will make *you personally* feel useful. As you know from basic economics, anyone who gets paid - and lots of people who don't - from butchers to bakers to candlestick makers, is useful to society. Your question isn't really about what is useful so much as about what makes you feel fulfilled and like you matter. So, what makes you feel fulfilled? I don't know. No one knows but you.

e5t89kb,t3_9f0r8v,True,AstraGlacialia,t2_ror2i,"Yes, even in places where graduating students isn't directly counted for benefits such as salary bonus / promotion to full professor. We recently lost a (very accomplished) PhD student - NOT kicked out, but decided to leave after a disabling injury (not in lab) - and I see my advisor (tenured since a couple of years ago) was badly upset about it and is now under more pressure to get the rest of us to publish and graduate.

As u/airwalker12 already mentioned, the expelled students and even more the other students, postdocs etc. in the group and department are likely to talk badly about the professor, which will make new students, postdocs etc., especially good ones, less likely to join the group. Such rumors tend to be [exaggerated and not entirely truthful](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/8m1j4y/countering_rumors_about_my_research_group/), so losing PhD students is bad for professor's reputation even when the professor entirely isn't at fault.

Furthermore, if the expelled student was funded from the professor's grant, the professor may need to explain what happened to the provider of funding, may have trouble switching the funds to a new student or some other purpose, and thus may even fail to even attempt the promised research and consequently be less likely to get further funding (from the same source). Also because the student's research may go unfinished and wasted (i.e., never published), or at least someone will waste lots of time to redo it almost from scratch, unless the student left good enough notes that someone can easily take over (which is in some fields difficult and rare) or/and is able and willing to train the successor (which is even rarer).

Finally, professors tend to care about their work, so they may face personal feelings of failure and disappointment that they didn't manage to get the student to perform and graduate, especially if they don't have many students - they may even get depressed and/or anxious about their ability to guide PhD students (remember, all these professors were once PhD students... many have a history of depression, anxiety and/or low/fluctuating self-esteem).

On the other hand, the benefits of kicking out an extremely unproductive and/or otherwise problematic student may still outweigh the costs.",3,2018-09-11 22:35:18

For some, the lack of a safety net can be terrifying and trigger depression.  For others, it can be exhilarating.  You now have an immense amount of freedom and very few people who can tell you what you are doing wrong.  Psychologically, that can be quite an adjustment.

Having always had an easy time in school both pre-uni and during uni as an undergrad, it was a gigantic blow to my ego to have to come to terms with the fact that I was one among many smart people, and not even near being ""the best"" anymore. My colleagues were all smarter, better, more well-read, more experienced, and they worked harder. I realised that while I love what I do, it's not my greatest ever passion in life and I won't ever be one of those people who get up at 5am and work until lights are out, or spend my weekends and holidays doing work. That doesn't mean I can't do well, but I won't be ""the best"" and that's fine. My work is not the reason I get up in the morning.

To be able to complete my PhD I had to work through anxiety, depression, burn-out, fear, and God knows what else. I had to come to terms with the fact that I knew next to nothing, and that I would not be an amazing academic star but more the kind that does good enough and who has a LOT to learn still. 

It has most certainly been a transforming experience. I have learned what hard work and perseverance truly mean, I've had to overcome myself and my insecurities, and accept myself the way I am with a more realistic view on what my strengths and weaknesses are. I've also realised that I love doing what I do for a living, and that it is worth it to jump through all the hoops needed to obtain tenure in the future.",50,2018-09-03 12:10:16

I got kicked out (top tier state uni) and then proceeded to grow a ton over the next 10 years, get a professional degree, get some work experience, and decide to go back to school. In 2004  there was no policy for readmittance, and I was about to do an online BA completion program like the one thru ASU, but by 2013 my big state uni had a clearly laid out path for people like me to return and finish. I was skeptical of the timing, but it worked out well! I had to petition the Deans of my college, and complete a year at a CC with a B average. Upon doing these things, they reviewed my CC transcript and petition and I was readmitted - it was almost formality, really. I spent Jan - Dec at a CC, and the following Jan I was back at Uni. Granted, I was back at Uni with a shit GPA, and only one semester to turn it around, so stakes were high in my case (but between a retroactive medical withdrawal, working my ass off during that one term, and transferring in better grades I got up to  a 2.4 by graduation that spring, yay!). 

Anyway, I'm sharing my story with you because I remember how impossible all this felt at the outset, and I want to personally say that college officials actually love people like us.

One of the (healthy) ways to cope with that is to be distracted from the source of that anxiety on a regular basis, even if only for a short while, but for at least an hour at a time. Depending on your boyfriend's inclinations this could mean exercise, sports, hobbies, etc. So make sure he's not neglecting these. Weekend breaks as suggested below are also excellent distractions. 

Another approach is for your boyfriend to be aware that he may be ""catastrophizing"", i.e. making predictions that have little foundation, and then becoming anxious on the basis of such predictions. The key strategy in avoiding this is to be aware that it occurs.

e0phqgw,t3_8r5eac,True,riggorous,t2_asvfd,"You're clearly a kind and considerate person, but mentoring your PI's students and certainly helping them with their mental illness is not your job. You're a postdoc, and you're there to do your research and get your publications out. You're not the lab mother and shouldn't feel obligated to perform unpaid emotional labor on behalf of your PI and his (HIS) students. If your friendships start interfering with your work professional network and emotional well-being (which I think is happening here), you should step away.

The way your PI talks to his students is not okay and, from what you've said here, he sounds like a shitty boss. That said, the student also does not sound prepared to be in the program in multiple ways, from academic preparation to her mental wellbeing. That's definitely a toxic combination that has no easy solution. It's also not your responsibility.

&gt; we had to take a walk or close the office door because she would break down sobbing. I have had many life discussions with her trying to talk her down and help her through this time. 

&gt; She has a history of mental illness, including depression and anxiety and confided in me that she had attempted suicide before starting grad school.

It's important to have strong boundaries with people like this student especially if you are by nature kind and compassionate, because you risk getting way too embroiled in their struggles and essentially taking the place of the professional qualified to deal with their stuff that they otherwise would've gone to. For example, the suicide stuff, you're not equipped to deal with that. She should be telling that to a psychiatrist or other medical specialist who does not have a personal place in her life. She also needs to work with this professional to develop coping strategies that do not involve her breaking down in tears in the workplace and needing her coworkers to take time out of their day to console her on a regular basis. Those aren't things you can help her with but they're also things she's been able to put off dealing with because you've been stepping in to help her out.

I understand she's your friend but you cannot be the only support for a mentally ill person in a stressful situation. That will end badly. She needs a rigid support system and coping skills besides crying on your shoulder.

&gt; Would I be out of place getting in touch with the PI and talking to him about his supervising style?

Well, if you phrase it like ""talking to him about his supervising style"", oh yeah, major overstep. He's your superior, it's his lab where you were a temporary guest. You don't show up to your boss's house and teach him how to parent his children. That said, if you know the guy well and can phrase your points in a tactful way it's worth a try. I don't know if you're summarizing your conversations as e.g.

&gt; explained to him that he should be careful with the way he talks to her

but I certainly wouldn't use any language that tells him what to do. That's really not your place and might cause him to disregard what you're saying. I'd just give him the facts: ""I've noticed that Sally becomes very distressed following your meetings and this affects her productivity and the productivity of anyone in lab who is witnessing it.

If you want to do this, then you're liable to spend months or years of your personal life with no guarantee of success. If you have experience working with drug addicts and/or the mentally ill, that will help you. Not because everyone who holds far-right beliefs is genuinely mentally ill. It's just that, in my experience, dealing with those patients is a similar experience and a similar sort of difficulty. It will drain you, as a human being.  

Like many people with kooky beliefs, I was and still am suffering from long-standing depression and several other mental problems. A lot of people do. If you point to mental illness as the beginning and end of strange beliefs and call it there, then you've lost your patient. You need to go deeper. You may have heard of the priests who spent months listening to racists and befriending them. From what I've seen, that level of patience is the norm and not the exception when it comes to successfully changing someone's worldview.

dzd048a,t1_dzcygmz,True,NoahPM,t2_11018b,"Fair enough, I probably haven't made it clear, but I feel like I can explain pretty plainly what I'm interested in.

All the things I'm interested in are for the same purpose.  To do research in psychology in no more than maybe 3 related topics.  What particular areas do I want to do research in?  Well I guess it may be kind of vague, but do you really have to pin yourself down that specifically?

I know I want to do research on mental illness, performance\-based psychology \(I'm very interested in the application and further study of the concept of flow, not just as a performance\-related concept but as a foundation for exploring mental illness as a whole due to its correlation with happiness and life satisfaction\), and the impact of laws, governance, and punishment on the individual.

If I had to pick one mental illness, it would be depression and/or bipolar disorder, but must I?  Is it not the case that some people do research on many different things within the same subject, or could do research on all these things over the course of their career?

I'm generally in the field of thought that mental illnesses have a lot of overlap in their causes and symptoms, and perhaps treatment, which is why I'm not sure I'd want to pin myself down to studying one disorder.  Perhaps study of anxiety could lead to insight about depression, or schizophrenia, or perhaps studying bipolar disorder could yield insight into depression or anxiety as independent disorders, or studying ptsd could yield insight into treatment/causes of all these things.

I figure I'm going to have go a pretty basic foundational route, not trying to close off any options.  But is it possible to pursue all of those research topic?  If I take a pre\-law concentration in my undergrad \(or maybe that parts not necessary\), minor in stats or neuroscience, go to a psychiatric epidemiology masters program, then a PhD in psychology, and acquire the appropriate research experience?

You said apply to clinical psychology programs.  Why is that?  I have little interest in becoming a clinical psychologist.  I figured cognitive psychology would be a better fit.

That's interesting you said studying stats could cause you to get disillusioned in neuroscience today, because I wanted to study stats so as differentiate between bs and non\-bs claims, and to advance general critical thinking skills.  Is that not a worthy goal?",1,2018-05-22 00:19:38
dzcygmz,t1_dzcjbfl,True,doctorink,t2_72m0f,"Well, first, it's really difficult to tell what you're interested. You name a lot of topics, and a lot of impacts (neuroscience, stats, epi, law, policy), but not a single subject you're interested in. 

That's fine, you're not there yet, but you have to find an actual topic to pursue. Again, fine, that can develop over time, and can and will change a lot. But until you know what you want to study (say, the neurodevelopmental underpinnings of depression, or why some people end up with alcohol disorders and others don't), I'd keep options open.

And it's just my opinion, but if you get very savvy with statistics, you'll become disillusioned with the small samples, dodgy methods and large overhyped claims in neuroscience. It's getting better, but it'll take a long time.

So I kind of feel, cynically, like it's an either or.

But the most important thing to do right now is start getting research experience in someone's lab. Do that ASAP. Classes matter a little, GPA more, GREs more. 

But the most important thing (once your GPA and GREs are above threshold) is getting good research experience that eventually leads to your own research projects, which turn into posters, or publications. That shows people you're ready for grad school.

I fully understand why you think that way, I have been there myself. I took my comprehensive exams during a period of poor health where I hadn't eaten for days and barely drank any water, all because I didn't want to use my illness as a crutch to get ""better"" test taking conditions, such as extended time or something. I thought it was unfair, and my advisors told me I was wrong and I absolutely was. Your health cannot be changed, but the circumstances around the assignment and work can be. It's not a crutch to give you an advantage, but rather helping you have equal opportunity for success. Depression and anxiety can be long term, if not lifetime, things to deal with. It's important for the university to know in case things get worse or circumstances change, even if not in this class but for a future class.

I then went to grad school and got a master's and a doctorate.

I am specifically speaking about Germany. Here, people are on a six month ""evaluation period"" after which the contract need not be renewed for any reason. I personally know 2 people who did not get their contract renewed because they were suffering from depression. There was a big discussion regarding the ethics of this decision and the advisor defended themselves by stating that as much as they feel for their depressed PhD student, continuing on with the PhD would effect their quality of life even more (even if the root cause of depression/suicidal behaviour is not PhD work) as PhD in itself is quite demanding. So the advisor said that they were watching out for the PhDs by letting them go. 

In terms of ""never to be mentioned again"", I think it has more to do the reputation of the advisor. If people learn that a PhD student attempted suicide while working with a certain advisor, they might think it must be horrible to work with the advisor and the advisor might have a very hard time attracting students. Again this is a new advisor problem. 

I know of another story that happened at my place of work where a person attempted suicide and was well into their PhD. The person was working with a well established advisor. The advisor let the student go on a 6 month medical leave and a 3 month rehab. The project of the student was changed to far far less challenging one and they were also given supportive roles in other project where they could contribute. The student still graduated in 5 years with one first author paper and 2 other papers.

If this is a personal friend of yours who is comfortable and wants to discuss their own story with you confidentially, of course that is OK. 

Depression or other mental illnesses are considered medical conditions by the Americans with Disabilities Act, which most universities adhere to. 

When it gets to this point, the person's psychiatrist has to determine if the person will ever be fit to return to school (to earn this degree in this environmental situation, or move to a less ""stressful"" degree etc). It is typically with some medical accommodation, such as time off, part time work, more time allowed to complete the work (but NEVER less work overall). The student needs to be registered with the disability office with a letter from doctor confirming disability, and the student's doctor makes the accommodation recommendations for completing the degree. I have given more details on this in past replies. 

On the other hand, who would want to go back and work with this PI?  I certainly would not.

 In the US, a PI could not unilaterally end this candidate's degree path if there were medical accommodation recommendations in place; it is possible that a committee including the department, PI, legal office, and disabilities office could do so. Expiration of funding could also play a role, i.e. a PI would not necessarily be expected to fund someone if the prior funds no longer existed (this latter reason is used a lot - sometimes they naturally expire with no chance of renewal, or sometimes not renewed on purpose in order to eliminate someone...)",55,2018-10-13 02:19:56

But, again, I too felt crushed by the importance of the tasks ahead and would never finish the papers. Depression can make even the tiniest things seem impossible to handle, it's even worse for your work. This made me so angry, I felt like I was letting go of all the effort that put me here.
You seem like a hard-working person and from what you have told us, you seem to have a real  talent for writing. Everything that this professor did and continues to do to you was wrong in every way and it has damaged you greatly. However, if deep down you still think academia is the path for you, should you let him ruin your passion ? He took a piece of you but you have too much potential to let him take all of you. Although the classrooms and the whole field might feel like his right now, they were yours too before he assaulted you and you enjoyed them, you can make them yours again.

I think the first step forwards is to seek professional help. You've been sexually assaulted and continue to be harassed, it might be helpful to speak to a psychiatrist about it. Most universities have counselling services. Although they are not perfect, they can be a good starting point.

I am sorry to hear this happened to you OP. If academia is truly your path, I hope you can regain the confidence to exploit your immense potential ! If you think academia is not for you anymore, I'm sure you will find another path that is more satisfying for you and where your potential will be used.  Good luck !",1,2018-10-08 08:08:10
e7d8q2h,t3_9m9wvu,True,NoFlyingMonkeys,t2_1hgh9anj,"Talk to your psychiatrist MONDAY. What you are describing fits with PTSD and depression. I hope you have been under treatment for this, but it sounds like you need much more right now. You would qualify for  time off for therapy and reduced course load upon return under Americans with Disabilities Act. Register with your school's Disability office if you have not already. 

You have clearly not recovered from your trauma.   Talk to your doctor about ways that this has affected your schoolwork and get this documented with the school.  If you do not want to disclose what happened to you, you can do this also - your doctor can simply state that you have a medical condition that needed treatment, and this affected your school performance. And that accommodations will be required in the future and what those should be. A copy of this should go to the school's disability office and your advisor. Work with your doctor to make a plan for time off for recovery and treatment; this needs to be your top priority right now. Your health is the most important thing. There is no harm in delaying school at all. 

EDIT:  Also, if you are seeing your attacker all the time, this may be triggering all this to escalation. You need to be away for this for a time. You need to consider a transfer to another school as well since they will not give you a restraining order - this is the part I don't understand why they won't do this.",8,2018-10-08 01:23:20
e7d6y5x,t3_9m9wvu,True,[deleted],,"\&gt; “sorry I missed so much class, I’ve been depressed and stressed out.” That’s not an excuse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, you say that. Most good students are, to a greater or lesser degree, depressed and stressed out. That level of stress is certainly not an excuse. But what you describe is \*so far\* beyond that. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing you need to do, I would say, is take care of yourself, and there are two things you can do, today, to help. The first, and most important thing is to find a counsellor. Your school should offer counselling services, and that's where I'd start. The quality of free counselling at college can be hit-an-miss, so you may or may not want to find another counsellor in the long term. But you should be able to go today and get free counselling. Mostly for your health, but also because that absolutely can be an ""excuse"" - you don't have an excuse, you have an \*actual reason\*. Your life has been pretty comprehensively messed up by circumstances beyond your control that leave you legitimately unable to study. It sounds to me like you haven't had any counselling for that, and you really need it.

&amp;#x200B;

The second thing is to talk to the ombudsman/student advocate/whatever they are called at your college. They can give you more advice on specific policies at your institute, but again, what you really need here is support, because it sounds like you haven't really taken advantage of the support that your college offer - and that you need - at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, as you're discovering, this becomes a difficult loop to break. It's hard to say ""OK. This really affects me, and I am not coping"", and to then access the formal support that allows you to go to professors and say ""I am really unable to study at the moment - here is a note from my counsellor and the ombudsman explaining my circumstances"", which \*is\* an ""excuse"" - or rather, an actual reason. And the longer it gets, the harder that becomes.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what formal processes your institute will have for revisiting the past F's. I do know that the overwhelming majority of professors - especially if you have been a good and diligent student - will absolutely want to help as far as they can if you have legitimate issues that are causing you this level of stress and depression. But they can't help you at all if you don't go through the process. The process is unfortunately difficult - and of course more difficult the more stressed you are! But the process is there to allow professors to say ""Ok! I don't care what your issues are and you don't have to tell me, but they are serious enough that you have a note from a counsellor saying you are unable to complete this unit. How can I help you with that?""

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes it means a leave of absence, sometimes it means extra credit or make-up work. But if you have gone through the process and have a formal request for ""help"", then professors have some latitude, and yes, that absolutely may mean they can now, formally, say ""I will grant you an extension for this paper, please hand it by this ultra-late date"". 

&amp;#x200B;

And I've stressed the formal process here because generally there's not much professors can do if you don't follow the process. But they will mostly be happy to \*talk\*, especially if your circumstances are already on record with security and the Dean. The formal process gives you one central opportunity for this conversation with someone trained to handle it - you probably don't want to have it with every professor. But you absolutely can go to them and explain. Believe me, plenty of mediocre students who really don't have excuses are more than happy to say ""You have to accept my ultra-late paper, I stubbed my toe the day before it was due."" And even just talking to your professors may help. Chances are their response will be ""I can't do much without a letter from your counsellor"", but they will at least explain to you what they \*can\* do if you bring them that letter - which may be more than you think. As evidenced by your mentors telling you that handing the papers in will help - they are already telling you that people are prepared to make accommodation for you. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, this has become an essay. But please, please, stop believing that this is any normal level of ""depressed and stressed out"". This is absolutely ""There is help available to you and you should take it"".",10,2018-10-08 00:53:28

edyull9,t3_aew4qd,True,Alternative_Squirrel,t2_26lbrndy,"I spent my second and third years of my PhD in a deep, deep depression. I would go to class, go to meetings, TA, etc and then come home and cry for hours. every. single. day. I would tear up on the bus while going to buy my groceries. 

I felt like I couldn't talk about it to anyone. I felt like I was really going through the motions in public with a ""normal"" mask on, but inside I was silently crumbling. I had never felt this \*bad\* before, and I was really worried that it was going to be my new normal - that this was just what life was going to be like from now on.

It got better.  I slowly started to climb out of it. Eventually, I went to therapy, and that helped me talk about the root cause and work through it (I used one of those texting therapy apps, it was significantly less expensive than traditional therapy and worked just fine for me). 

This year, I'm finishing my PhD and heading to a great job. I'm genuinely excited for the future.

When I look back at myself in those years, I'm amazed at how strong I was. Oh, \*at the time\*, I felt like the saddest, weakest, most pathetic person on the planet, but looking back at how hard it was just to even function, how hard it was to even get out of bed in the morning, I am amazed that I found the strength to do it (and some days, I didn't, and that's ok).

Yeah - this is what stuck out to me. Academic jobs are super competitive and the perseverance that it takes to get a PhD also means we're really bad at figuring when to cut bait on what might be our ""Plan A"" if it just isn't going to work out. What's his end goal? Tenure track faculty doing a niche piece of research? That's probably not realistic - it's not realistic for the VAST majority of people who finish their PhDs. I can't even fathom wanting to deal with the BS of a post-doc and then the complete insecurity of the academic track at 44.  


I imagine some part of his depression is based on mourning his dream job - but at the same time,  It also sounds like a lot of his self-worth is tied up in being the breadwinner - especially now that you guys have a kid. His resentment may be less about having rejected the post-doc offer a few months ago and more about jealousy over the fact that you're working and he isn't. If he can take a job, even if it isn't his dream job, I expect that will help a lot with his state of mind.  


However, you're probably both going to need some couple's therapy regardless. From your story it doesn't sound like the two of you communicate very well at all - and it certainly doesn't sound like you're on the same page about your goals as a family. So you should probably pursue this even if his magical unicorn job pops up tomorrow and causes his attitude to do a 360.  


FWIW, I know a number of people who have made the two-body problem work. I was the trailing spouse when I finished my PhD - I moved to where my wife was still finishing med school before I had a job lined up (and after 6 years of long-distance) and managed to find a post-doc at her institution. I'll likely be the trailing spouse again in the near future when she gets matched to a residency program. Likewise, one of the other post-docs in my lab's wife has a post-doc at another university about 3.5 hours away. He drives up there every weekend. They also have a kid, but they seem to be making it work. The important thing about long-distance is that it needs to be finite - you need a plan for making it not long distance anymore. Another one of my friends from high school and his wife finished their PhDs around the same time. She got a pretty well-paying job on the other side of the country. He's started teaching high school.

That said, I am not technically lying. I tell that attendance will be graded, but I don't tell how exactly. Giving a flat grade is technically still a grade. In the same vein, ""lose a certain number of points"" technically includes ""not losing any points"" as a special case, for the ""certain number of points"" value set to zero.

The only thing I'd recommended your professor to change in their policies, if they asked me, is to tell students that either sick absences are excused, or a certain fixed number of absences each semester is excused. They definitely don't want students with flu come to class. Other than that, it sounds like a good policy to me.

Similarly, sometimes I announce that there will be a closed-book test next class, and then make it open-books. I never make the test harder than I promised, but I often make it a bit simpler.

First, yes, the field is extremely competitive. It is very, very difficult to land a tenure-track job, or even a permanent job of some kind as a history professor.

Second, ask yourself why you want to be a history professor. Do you want to teach or do research? As the field becomes competitive, more and more positions lean on their new history hires to publish, bring in grants, and win awards. This adds to the ""prestige"" of the school. In my experience, teaching for a TT job has become less important.  I recently heard that the institution I got my Ph.D. from just hired someone with phenomenal, innovative research but precisely zero teaching experience.

Third, if you are still interested in getting Ph.D., seriously consider which field you pursue. The fields of American and European history are glutted with Ph.Ds right now, and it is very hard to find a job in those areas. Asia/Islamic history is doing okay, but still declining. World/African-American/African history are, to my knowledge, the only fields that have seen some kind of growth in the past couple of years. Right this moment, pitching your work as global/world in scope, methodology, or approach is ""in."" However, all of this is subject to change. What's fashionable today may not be (and will likely not be) fashionable by the time you finish your dissertation.

Fourth, if you still want to pursue a master's and Ph.D., despite knowing all of this, then give it a shot. Getting a Ph.D. in history was one of the most satisfying and fulfilling experiences of my life. It changes how you view the world. Just remember that you are far, far more likely to leave academia than you are to eventually land a TT job.

&amp;#x200B;

If you decide to go for a Ph.D., here are some tips:

\-Get a hobby unrelated to academia. Don't feel guilty about pursuing that hobby when you need a break. Be social. Make plans to hang out with people.

\-Make contacts and networks with younger Ph.D.s, people who know what research is ""fashionable,"" and people who are closer to the realities job market (i.e. still looking for TT themselves or just got a TT job; do not rely on your 60-year-old advisor for all advice)

So I think my struggle is that in my undergrad I did exceptionally well with minimal effort because the subject came easy to me, however it isn’t a profitable career so I made a switch where I could still do some of what I loved (which I do currently) and still be able to have a decently comfortable life. However with this switch I have struggled to keep up because I am behind my peers educationally in the field. I got very overwhelmed very fast by my research project due to it being a totally new subject I had to learn about from scratch. 
I switched to a more engineering based subject and while I value what I do. I believe what I do is wonderful for society and specifically certain communities I am trying to help. 
My mentor is also very hands off and is sometimes hard to talk to, he also keeps changing my project and I sometimes have trouble adapting the project to the changes he wants. These changes are often arbitrary changes as well, he will forget which numbers he wanted me to use then change them, then change them back and it’s exhausting. 

So really I’m miserable because I started from behind and have had a really hard keeping up. This causes depression which in turn makes it harder to keep up and be motivated. It’s a vicious cycle I’m trying to break. ",1,2019-02-21 13:49:04

1. I've got a great working relationship with my advisor. He's a fantastic boss and really looks out for his graduate students. I think his only negative attribute is that he doesn't have many connections in industry so the legwork for finding a job is all on me, but it's not the worst thing. I feel like the job search builds character and I'm sure I'll get one eventually - I've had interviews so I'm doing something right.
2. Having your research go well, or at least having some successes . A good part of my depression was a result of being on a dead-end project that wasn't going anywhere. It can be really demotivating when you try and try and try and fail over the course of years and eventually I just stopped trying (depression). Once I switched to a better project, life got much better. I wish it wasn't so tied to the work, but that's the nature of graduate school.
3. I exercise regularly, am married to a great wife and have a good group of friends. My life outside of work is dope.

Things started out well. My methodology for investigating my research question attracted some funding,  and my supervisor was cooperative. 

Bells should have rung, however, when they could not find a second supervisor for my project from within the university. Instead I ended up with a remote second supervisor - one thst *I had to organise*, rather than my first do it.

I got on with my research, collected a morass of information, transcribed all my interviews personally and took them to my first yearly meeting to be told they were 'just data'. No positive comment on the amount of work that had gone into it. 

This became the defining motif of my postgraduate time.  My supervisor was a very, very bitter person,  who could never say anything positive about anything I did. I transferred from Mphil to PhD on the strength of two chapters. However, events in my personal life started to stack up, along with a growing depression fostered by my postgraduate environment. 

Things came to a head at a final yearly meeting with another faculty member present. The work I had submitted was rambling and sub-par.  The orh8er faculty member was positive and siggested changes. My supervisor began the usual berating, at which point I stated that if they could not make one positive statement that I would exit the meeting. They then shouted at me, in front of our mutual colleague.

What was shouted was not, as you might have guessed, positive. 

I requested a supervisor change to anither department member. They were able to arrabge an in-house second supervisor, who they then switched places with to make the second my primary. 

I spent a year attempting to meet demands that I completely rewrite my thesis from the ground up with a new focus, nee methodology, new literature review on a completely new topic, and generate a new theoretical framework from this.

Attempting to rewrite an entire PhD from scratch in 12 months proved too difficult.

At this point my department second supervisor grabbed me as I was leaving a teaching engagement to tell me my registration was being pulled. I argued for the chance to submit for an Mphil. I spent six months trying to pull a lot of disparate things together. I submitted my Mphil thesis last July. In September it was rejected, and five and a half years of my life came to nothing.

There were many things I could have done better off my own bat. There were many things I could have improved. But my first supervisor was neglectful, arrogant and toxic. When I had the temerity to change this I was effectively railroaded out.

But I never had much of a problem with that because I've never had a class with mandatory attendance, so I just didn't go to the few 8am lectures I had. 

Sitting exams in a separate room helped too, I think, but I did that from my first semester, so I have nothing to compare it to. 

&gt;High functioning schizophrenics I infer are not often open about such things.

Well, my diagnosis isn't public, so I imagine others are private with things too. Not even my parents know, because I was just over 18 when officially diagnosed. They just think that I used to have depression but that I'm over it now.

&gt;why is the 4-day hike an issue?

It's 4 days in a country I've never been to before, far away from any space I might call my own, with 100 people I've never met, spending all of our waking and sleeping hours together, doing challenging and somewhat confronting tasks. 

I'll be socially fatigued within an hour and I'll be desperate to leave by the 4th hour. If I'm fatigued and stressed and anxious, I'll get ill. This isn't a problem for things like conferences because I can just take a few minutes alone to chill, but there's nowhere to retreat to when you're climbing up a cliff face. Otherwise I need to be constantly plied with coffee to keep my energy up, which isn't good in general, and also isn't possible on a cliff face. 

&gt;The busy office?

10 people tend to make a lot of noise even when they're working quietly. It's hard enough to focus as it is. I can manage the occasional disruption, but when you share an office with 10 people, it's constant and I can't do any work.",14,2019-04-04 07:08:11
ejx3vzl,t3_b8adep,True,myristicae,t2_1i5lscjc,"&gt;I feel in general really unhappy, isolated, losing interest in food, have had no sex drive for months, trouble sleeping/staying asleep.

These are all classic symptoms of depression. I'm not diagnosing you or saying you have it, but even if you don't, those are still serious symptoms that need to get better. 

&gt;I really don't want to take antidepressants so I haven't been to a doctor yet.

**You do not have to take an antidepressant** in order to treat depression. Make an appointment with a therapist, not a psychiatrist (much cheaper anyway, or probably free at a university). ""Talk therapy"" (without meds) can be very effective for depression. Even if the therapist wants you to consider taking medication, they should respect your decision not to and help you pursue other methods of treatment. 

&gt;And because I feel like if I quit this would all go away, that to me doesn't seem like clinical depression.

Symptoms of depression lasting more than two weeks are usually considered clinical depression. ""Situational"" depression, which occurs due to a stressful life event, is still a form of depression and it's still very treatable. 

&gt;But if people could let me know if in your experience this sounds similar to your burnout/depression I would be grateful.

I really relate to what you said about crying, then progressing to feeling numb. For me, when I'm getting depressed I cry a lot but then when it gets worse I start to feel like a zombie. For me, burnout shows itself more as boredom and impatience with what I'm stuck doing, and yearning to pursue other interests. Whereas when I'm depressed, I don't have other interests. But it may be different for you. Also, you could be experiencing both.

I may be a unique case, but I'm not the only high-achieving depressed student out there. (How else would you fill graduate schools?) I don't think that my teachers should have been trying to identify and intervene; rather, they helped when they included information about the counseling center in syllabus, made clear that they were open to accommodations on assignments, and showed respect for depression and other disabilities in a way that removed stigma. 

I appreciated professors was when they allowed accessibility and flexibility in their class: by allowing laptops, posting slides to be accessed beforehand, allowing students to record lectures, and letting us know that if we were struggled and needed accommodations we should contact them.

Also, I started my diagnosis process by talking to my primary care physician, who then made a referral. There is a lot of overlap between some ADHD symptoms and generalized anxiety and depression. I had been medicated for years for both anxiety and depression, though I've stopped both of those medications now that I am being properly medicated for the ADHD. I also know plenty of people with ADHD who have developed strong enough coping skills through therapy that they don't feel like they NEED the medication, which is an aspirational goal of mine. The same can often be true of anxiety--just because your brain has some default settings that really mess your life up doesn't mean you're trapped in your current situation.   


CBT gave me the starter tools to think about my own thought process analytically, and to be much more self aware as to why and how things often *feel* the way they do in a way that doesn't quite match up with the reality that I can prove with evidence.

eiau8pf,t3_aztzyn,True,WookieRubbersmith,t2_adfib,"You feel burnt out because *you are.* In my personal experience, you cannot just muscle through feeling burnt out without doing some lasting damage to your psyche. For me, anyway, that feeling of brain fog and burn out that you're describing is a precursor to a depressive episode. I don't think we talk enough in academia about how allowing yourself to get overworked can be a major trigger for depression, which can then make getting  *anything* done feel impossible. Muscling through, in this way, can prolong and deepen the feelings of burnout, rather than cure them.   


When you take days to yourself--what do you do with them? Do you do something active that gets you outside, or are you vegging in front of netflix while that pit of anxiety about all of the work you have left to do grows? It can be difficult to do \~activities\~ instead of work, because maybe you feel guilty that you have enough energy for a hike, but not for your work. If this is something you struggle with, know that the feeling of guilt is unfounded. There is no rule that says that ALL of your BEST energy MUST go towards work, and your brain probably needs a break.  


Are you giving yourself a change of scenery or a shake up of activity for these reset days? Counterintuitively, I find that taking *active* rest days--taking a long walk outside, working on my car, taking care of some deep cleaning projects, meal prepping--make me feel much more refreshed than vegging, even though my tired little brain really believes that vegging=relaxation. While your body may be relaxing, I'd guess you're not giving yourself a mental break from the work left ahead of you, and so you are not *actually resting.* You are just anxiously avoiding work. Your brain is tired and overworked. It is your brain, more so than your body, that needs a break. Give it something fun and active to do.  


Here is a thing that has been working well for me lately. People--everyone--recommended yoga to me for a decade before I tried it. They were right, damnit. Lately, I'd been feeling really overwhelmed and burnt out and overworked on my current teaching load. My husband and I have started doing very short exercises together (google the scientific 7 minute workout--I love it.) and then a 20-30 minute yoga video right after (30 days of yoga with adriene is a great place to start). We do this maybe...3-4 times a week? And even that is actually enough to make a difference. I also find that doing this right before I sit down to do some work really helps to clear my head if I am having a foggy day and also *must* do work.  


Final thought--keep track of how much water you are drinking. Carry a water bottle with you everywhere, and keep track of how  many times you refill it in a day, if you don't already. If you've fallen into the trap of trying to counter your brain fog with caffeine, you are probably also dehydrated. Dehydration can make you feel lethargic and foggy, and for some reason when I'm feeling burnt out, I tend to also forget to drink enough water, which makes it dramatically worse.

Have you been formally diagnosed with depression? Are you seeking treatment? If not, you need to do that *ASAP*. Otherwise, you won't have much ground to stand on when it comes to asking them to be lenient in their consequences. If they are going to make an exception to their policy, you will need to be able to demonstrate that not only have you been keeping up with your research, but that you also have a documented, legitimate explanation for your recent lapse in attendance. They will also want to see a clear plan from you as to how you plan to be successful in the remainder of your studies.

Stop me if this was already done, but ideally earlier on in your absence you would have had a discussion with your advisor about what their expectations of your attendance would be like, and what you felt was necessary given your depression. You should also have reached out to your university's disabilities/student services to establish your medical condition and get appropriate accommodations, in your case working remotely, sorted out.

In general, I'm on board with that. However, let's say someone makes an argument based on some empirical data and conceptual analysis. Let's also say that this is a deductive argument (it could be inductive or abductive, but the point is easiest with deductive). Whether it's a valid argument isn't a matter of experience--it's a matter of logical form. Whether the premises are true or false, as long as those premises aren't referring to that person's experience, also aren't a matter of experience.

Now, maybe there's a problem in asserting that argument--maybe there are norms of assertion which mean that unless I am part of the class of people affected by the conclusion I shouldn't put the argument forward. (Well, in this case I am--so that can't be quite right. So maybe it's that I have to be part of the class of people affected by the argument and also make that known to everyone involved in evaluating the argument.)

dgj8kdv,t3_66iiyg,,northerthanyou,t2_9utdn,"I've been in private practice as a veterinarian for 10 years so I'll comment on this. 

First of all - the debt should honestly be your biggest concern. Vet school debt is incapacitating for many veterinarians, many of whom have &gt;$250,000 in debt by the time they graduate. Do you have any student debt already? I would try to come up with a very realistic estimate of what you'll be paying for tuition and cost of living for the four years in vet school and then fudge the number upwards a little bit, and then try to calculate what your monthly student loan payments would be. I've heard from numerous vets who expect to still be owing money beyond when they retire. Their student debt precludes them from home ownership, or vacations, and is often a significant contributor to stress and depression. I applaud you for considering this - I think it's easier to have stars in your eyes when you contemplate a lifetime of taking care of animals, but debt has a huge impact on your quality of life, and I would try to make sure now that it's something you can handle. 

That said - I love my job. I honestly can't imagine doing anything else with such passion, I love both the physical and mental challenges of this job and I find the emotional rewards to be incredible. I could make orders of magnitude more money as a human physician, but I'm very happy with the career I've chosen and how it's worked out for me (for what it's worth, I live in Canada and I paid off all my student debt within 5 years, so I'm very fortunate to not have that hanging over me). 

I travel a lot, read ONLY books that are not science related, mountain bike, ski, and while I to a very large extent define myself by my job, it's because I love it so much and not because it's the only thing I have time for in my life. 

So to answer your second question - vet school is time consuming. It is all consuming, and for a lot of students can often be pretty miserable because it's really hard and at some point you will be up until 4 am cramming pig diseases even though you know that as a veterinarian you will never treat a pig in your life. But life as a veterinarian is pretty great (for me). The key to that though (for me) is responsible budgeting and not having incapacitating student loans. 

You sound like a well-rounded person who has more than one interest in life. If this is true, and if vet school would be a huge financial burden, then I would earnestly encourage you to consider another line of work that either has a greater financial reward (medicine, dentistry) or less of a student loan burden (pretty much anything else).

PM me with any other questions. ",11,2017-04-20 21:30:41
dn0xyav,t1_dn00iy8,,the_banished,,"I was passively suicidal for a large part of my program, in the sense that I stopped caring about whether I lived or died. I had struggled with depression in high school and college, and I thought moving out of state for grad school would give me a fresh perspective. It didn't, and from then on, suicide was always on my mind. I was seeing therapists and psychiatrists for most of my program.

I didn't consider quitting, because I think that would have probably made me actively suicidal. My entire self-worth from childhood on was rooted in academic achievements. ""If I quit the program,"" I thought, ""I will have failed."" My advisor was understanding when I told him I had depression. Turned out his daughter did too. 

I made it through.  Sometimes I think my advisor was afraid of what I might do if he failed me. As a result, a part of me thinks I really don't deserve my degree. That it was done out of pity. It's hard to shake this thought even though it's probably not true. Anyway, when I got my first job, the depression got worse because I relized that my only real goal--earning a PhD--had happened. I wanted nothing more out of life. 

Eventually, I checked myself into a psychiatric hospital because I had started researching suicide methods in earnest. I decided I owed myself a shot at life, so I drove myself to the hospital. I was there over the whole Winter Break. They let me out before the spring semester started, and I returned to work as if nothing had happened.

I still have depression and it's worse now than it's been in a while. I see a therapist and take meds, but the pressure to perform and assume the role of ""All Knowing Professor The_Banished"" is weighing heavily on me and I don't know what to do.

My advice to you is you have come this far, get your PhD. If you were a 2nd/3rd year I may suggest leaving the program.

Several teachers have responded and you are just contradicting their experience with your imagined idea of how this will work - that is why you are being downvoted!

On a practical level and in case you change your mind and do want to read opinions: teachers are more than just graduates who studied that subject at university (luckily for our kids!). If you want to be a teacher and you have not yet done this - speak to your mentor/tutors at school and see if you can get the classes you would need to become a teacher. You cannot cherry pick the best classes, so you will be an English teacher. I have to admit I am a little confused why you started an English degree if your life long dream was to be a biology teacher, but nevermind that now - your first hurdle is to become a teacher at all so I think you should focus on that. I am sure you could be an inspiring teacher in English who does things better than teachers in the past - why don't you try it on for size before you plan how to become a different teacher than the teacher you currently are not?

&gt; People try to stop me or tune out once they hear things they don't like and I have a really hard time stopping after that, making them angry.

&gt; This is why I'm going into Psychiatry.

Oh my god. Please don't.

I already posted about this today, so I'm gonna be really honest with you. Minorities are vulnerable populations, but people who are so mentally unwell that they need to be prescribed medication are a *really* vulnerable population. If you say a horrid thing to a healthy person, that may just ""make them angry"", but that same horrid thing said to someone struggling through an acute episode of depression or bipolar can drive them over the edge. People can be driven to suicide, do you understand? Especially by an authority figure they are told to trust.

Maybe they train psychiatrists to not be asshats because they have ""big ideas"", or maybe you don't have the background to do this anyway, so it's all a moot point, but like, keep in mind that medicine isn't just about satisfying your ego - it's also about serving a population in need. A lot of exceptionally smart people cannot look past their ego, and it is honestly better that they go into high finance or software engineering or somesuch, because a person who does not have the capacity for empathy doing a ""socially beneficial"" job is a much greater liability than that same person working to make the most money for himself as possible.

I do only have 250 words to judge you on so -

But, fyi, if you don't come to this sub often, you don't know that I'm basically a professional asshole. I advocate for controversial ideas all the time. All of my professional mentors have built their careers on advocating for controversial ideas. I can tell you, with all the strength of my experience behind me, that if your idea is perceived as a straw man - that's because you're selling it as a straw man. Whether that's because it's a straw man or you're an exceptionally bad communicator is not up to me to decide, because like I said, I know fuck all about anthropology. But this is the problem, and being butthurt about it is not going to resolve it. Nobody cares if you resolve it - it's your idea and your life. So if you mean business, I suggest you wipe away the snot and the notion that your idea stands on its own and get on with it, because nobody else will do it for you. 

We white collar people are not valued for our ideas - we are valued for our communication of our ideas. Right now you are a carpenter who has a plan for the best bedframe in the world. Your worth as a carpenter is not determined by your plan, but by your ability to actually build that bedframe. Otherwise, you are no one. Right now, with the victim complex, you are on a path to oblivion. No one cares if you don't get heard - there are 1000 others waiting to take your place. You have to fight for your place in the sun.

dsdwq7z,t3_7ozqw3,,abandoningeden,t2_88w0e,"What I found hard at first working with RAs was the realization that you need to train them in everything.  Like how to use google scholar. And how to read an academic article- literally grad students will not know which part of an article is to be read, will get stuck at the methods and start panicking, and never finish.  So first is training and also telling them that if they are stuck they need to contact you and also that if they screw up they need to tell you and that not telling you is worse than screwing up.  That should cover at least some of the basics.  

Then what you have them do depends on the type of research you do. I do mostly quant analysis of large datasets, and most RAs are useless when it comes to that type of work.  But I get an RA every semester for 6 hours a week (actually ours are joint TAs/RAs but I only teach 1 class with multiple sections each semester, so I only need grading certain weeks of the semester and the rest is RA time).  What I have found works awesome is having them do lit searches- like I will go through a key article or 3 and mark off a bunch of articles in the works cited list I want them to find, also tell them to do searches for certain key terms and words and to look for any new relevant research that cited certain articles.  Then I have them make me a document that has the works cited info in APA style + the abstract of each article (this is the document I go through systematically while writing up my lit reviews), and also gather up the PDFs to email me (for when I find articles I'm going to cite and want to see more info).   This has made writing the lit reviews for my papers take like 1/5th the time it used to.  

I also have had students do some simple coding of articles for me for a content analysis (but rarely have them do statistical analysis type coding- most can't handle it), investigate random things I need investigated (like when designing a survey and I wanted to include some questions on personality and anxiety/depression I asked them to gather up a bunch of different types of scales that were used to measure these things so I could steal from those to develop my survey), look up laws related to things I was researching, etc. 

Basically things that take a lot of time but are relatively easy should be sent to your RA, but be sure to train them.  Also you have to do work to get them to do work- so figuring out what you will have them look up on works cited and stuff takes work- but if you invest that time it will save you a lot more time later.

dinp2i7,t1_dinc1go,,the_banished,t2_clxic,"I struggled in grad school severely with depression, which was diagnosed and treated by psychiatrists and therapists. It's not something I would wish on anyone. The worst part was my brain telling me ""You're lazy and worthless"" all the time when I barely had the energy to move. I had dark thoughts I couldn't escape, because sleep brought only nightmares.

But I was lucky to get effective treatment so that I could finish my master's and doctorate. Am I an internationally renowned scholar at Harvard? No, far from it. But I work in academia in a teaching role that suits me. I'm very fortunate, and I take nothing for granted.

So, disregard that person's mean-spirited, useless comment. I could make a lot of warrantless assumptions about him/her as well based on people I've known, but doing so would be an exercise in intellectual dishonesty, as I know nothing about this person.

I was unmotivated and lethargic and getting my work done sometimes just felt impossible.

the team letting him off: that means that we excused him from teaching for a couple weeks.

i absolutely agree that the death of a parent is a tremendous loss. in many cases one doesn't start to fully grieve at the moment and much of the feelings of depression set in only later.

i do not feel that it was appropriate for him to claim this as an excuse. we had already made quite liberal accommodations in his case. i was not expecting that he would simply be completely over it after the time we gave him off. that may take months to years. all i am saying is that most employers, including us, do not allow more than a week off. and in his case, he shoved work on my desk without actually asking the professor we're ta-ing for for permission to do so.

this all comes in the context of several other problems with this person. mainly it is that no one else had a problem doing what i had asked and his father's death was not the only excuse he gave. he also just told me that what i was asking for was unreasonable, unnecessary, and said that i had not been clear. that makes no sense given that the other folks got it all done without any further prodding from me.",2,2017-06-08 02:26:47

I lost my father in undergrad. The immediate impact was not nearly as significant as the impact a few months to a year later. Numbness shrouded things for a while, and the long term things (settling estates, taking care of my mom and family) didn't really hit for a while. 

At the beginning, there's so much to do that the feeling of loss isn't as huge. It seems like they're just on a vacation. The true loss and depression hits later, often unexpectedly, and can be debilitating.

foucault's support of nambla went far beyond lesser sentencing for pedophiles, ""It is quite difficult to lay down barriers [particularly since] it could be that the child, with his own sexuality, may have desired the adult."" https://nambla.org/foucault.html

In the history of sexuality he expands on this more, arguing that adults have a puritanical view of children's sexuality and we should be more open to their expressions of ""lust"" for adults, condoning child/adult sexual relationships.

i do not accept every court's decision as gospel on every matter, so the fact that the french court deemed althusser not at fault due to ""depression"" doesn't mean much to me. legal arguments are not moral arguments. depressed people don't tend to murder people. i think that killing a woman should be more than enough to disqualify someone from the canon of a women's studies department. even if you believe his work is important and influential enough that it should be read by students in the field (i do not agree that it is), it should be framed in such a way that doesn't hide the fact that he killed his wife which is what my department did.

to expand on the point of this thread: men can literally kill women, and it's not enough to question their authority on women's experiences or feminist theory. second wave feminists on the other hand, are forbidden from being taught due to their association with an entire movement that has been vaguely deemed ""problematic."" that's what i'm commenting on.",2,2017-05-26 18:26:31
djn8ixt,t3_6kldye,,liometopum,,"I finished this spring and for a while I was about in the same place as you. What helped for me was approaching it as 'good enough for the dissertation'. I stopped worrying about publication and that took off a lot of the pressure. Then I just had to get it written and in OK shape so my committee would be able to give feedback. I had had a rough entry into the world of peer review, so this worked for me by shifting the focus away from the ultimate goal for each chapter and toward the proximate goal of finishing a thesis that basically no one will read anyway. 

Of course, now it's been a few months and I haven't managed to bring myself to fully revise those chapters for publication....

Here's the deal though. The hardest part of my PhD was mental. I had to find ways to force myself to do what I needed to do to finish and get past the sometimes crippling anxiety and probably some undiagnosed depression. The strategy that ended up working for me at the stage where you are was about removing some of the pressure I had put on myself. My dissertation didn't have to be perfect or earth shattering. It just had to be scientifically sound and finished. And it turns out that it's much more interesting to people that aren't completely burned out from working on it intensively for years. 

Best of luck with the end - if it helps, you are absolutely not alone in feeling like you feel. 

Edit: another thing to try is breaking it up by time instead of task until you get out of your funk. I literally put on my calendar 30 minute chunks where I had to write/revise a particular section of a chapter. It didn't have to be great or even good - I just had to do it for that short amount of time and then I could take a break and work on something else. ",5,2017-07-01 13:20:57

I lost 4 years of my life in severe depression, anxiety attacks and went into mental breakdown. Although it was way to late in getting help, I am fine now and I don't pity myself for that. I got to move on.

What I am thinking about is the future. At this point, I know I still want to go into academia. I am 24 years old. I am on Chemistry BS track with 3.0 GPA, and my record is very spotty with multiple retakes and Ws. Even if I graduate now, I won't able to get a good job anyway and my parents agreed to invest in me for few years more.

So, I am interested in Physical Chemistry and I have been in contact with the professor I want to research in. I have been doing very badly in his class (Statistical Mechanics), but I am trying to catch up and hopefully I know enough knowledge to start research by spring semester. Since his work have been very mathematical, I am planning to invest in a lot of advanced math classes (my current level is only Calc I~III and linear algebra), and may be take few classes in physics (wave and mechanics), although I am not sure. I also plan to take one advanced chemistry class per semester to fulfill my BS requirement.

My worries are my professor would be disappointed at my bad grades and won't give me serious attention when I try to do research under him. I am willing to change labs and look for similar work, but it would be a bummer. Second is whether this is good idea or not. I will take mix of math and chemistry classes for 2 and 3 years and would my efforts be worth it?

Before continuing on, yes I know there is hard road ahead of me and I read the sidebar posts. I just want to know whether it is possible or am I doing something foolish.

I know I made mistakes in the past. No matter. I just want to live again through any means and efforts.

And, before you ask, yes, I know I want to do research for a living.",1,2017-11-01 17:40:07
dos6g13,t3_789xuf,,hoggledorp,,"&gt; I am at my wits end. This man is ruining my life, and there is little I can do about it.

You sound dramatic. Quit being dramatic when discussing this to others. Be facts-oriented. This man probably isn't ""ruining your life."" You probably just (perhaps rightly) feel he is leading an unfair class.

&gt; I have an A in every course except the ones he teaches. He is the head of the program, and teaches a course every semester. I have one more semester after this.

Why does your grade in other courses mean you will get an A in his?

&gt; Holds quizzes 15 minutes before class. The quizzes are a small sample of 60 formulas from a formula sheet we need to have ""memorized"". The sheet ends up being impossible unless you straight memorize the formatting and characters. These sheets do not help with any learning objective, and are part of our HW grade at 60% of the grade.

It's stupid, but it's also his class. He can do this if he wants. If he deems it part of the material, you don't have a genuine gripe here. You just sound whiny.

&gt; We do not get homework handed back. 

I'm confused, you don't know your grades at all? Because he makes you redo problems, which implies you do?

&gt; He will post one of the ""mistake"" solutions on the overhead and essentially berate the person who authored it for the entire class, instead of teaching material. He doesn't post names on this, but its obvious when it is mine since I am one of 3 native english speakers in the class.

Well, it's his class. He's not using your name. I think this is scummy, but as long as he doesn't identify you there's nothing really damning going on here.

&gt; He won't actually teach the concepts, but instead yells yes/no questions at us and stares at us if we get it wrong. He will then re-iterate the fact of the answer without telling us why. Sometimes he sprinkles in verbal insults directed at no one in particular.

This is an opinion. You're probably right, but who are you to say he's not teaching concepts?

&gt; 
He will fail 3/4 of the class, and then hold a 'makeup final"" in the middle of our winter/summer breaks. He tells us if we are traveling/doing anything else that we are out of luck and this test is more important. He has ruined two much needed breaks and it's preventing me from recharging every time.

This is something you should bring up to the ombudsman. A professor doesn't have the right to require to be in the course outside of the scheduled time for the course. Talk to a dean or ombudsman. This a genuine gripe.

&gt; His tests are possible to get a negative score.

Yeah, weird. But not necessarily something he's doing against the rules.

&gt; He commented that if we failed a test, we should think about dropping. He then made a joke that if we have to drop, that we shouldn't kill ourselves. Actual wording was to ""not go to ithaca and jump off the cliffs.' I struggle with suicidal ideation and depression, and anxiety so this did not go over well.

Uh, well. Great. I mean yeah, he sucks but to an admin you will likely sound like a ""triggered student.""

&gt; I recieve academic accomodations for 1.5x time. Instead of providing them to me, he ends up extending the test by 1.5x for everybody.

You're both misspelling, and also whining, but you may have a point. Talk to your disability support office. Right now, you just sound like ""but *I* was supposed to have more time! I wanted it just for *me*"" But then again, if he gives it to everyone, he's essentially just extending the time of the exam. This will vary by university and usually be set in policy, but something to bring to your disability office. Honestly, I think you're just whining here to some extent.

&gt; He emails grades in a non-blind CC To everybody, and everybody knows who fails and who doesn't.

This is a genuine gripe. Bring it to your dean or ombudsman. It's a violation of FERPA: https://students.asu.edu/faq/154#t104n11157

&gt; He doesn't teach anything, and is essentially threatening to fail me, under the guise of helping me via ridiculous homework assignments and ""make up finals"". Our code of conduct explicitly says we cannot have make up finals outside the semester without approval. We're also not allowed to have our grade changed up, unless we were assigned an incomplete.

Bring it to the ombudsman.

&gt; His actions and behaviors actually make me want to hurt myself. I am not going to. I have a therapist, I have my medications, and I have support from my friends. However, in school, I am quite alone and it is hard to not have these awful plauging thoughts.

This is you complaining.

&gt; If you took out his class, I have a 3.95 GPA.

Nobody gives you the right to get a perfect grade. This is not a valid complaint. Yes, we get you're a good student. That's not an excuse to say you get to dictate his course material or grading practices.

&gt; I want to go talk to the ombudsman, but I am afraid of being dismissed from the program. 

Uh. No. You won't. What makes you think that a school would ""dismiss"" a 3.95 student for pointing out that a professor is violating FERPA. If they did that, you could literally sue the school. The Ombudsman's job is to make sure that can't happen.

&gt; It is that if he wants me to fail, I will.

You won't be kicked out for failing a single class.

&gt; I am crying every night, and medicating with weed and alcohol.

That's on you.

&gt; I am not the problem here, and do well when supported.

Frankly, yes. You **are** part of the problem. You're whining and acting like you deserve a great grade.

I'm sure you're a good student and all, but you sound like a real special snowflake, and deeply entitled. That being said, you do have some genuine complaints. Your professor is in the wrong for sure if he's doing what you say. Bring it up to your ombudsman and perhaps dean.",5,2017-10-23 19:09:23

do2teyq,t3_751bia,,brownidegurl,,"To echo what others have said here, academia may not be exactly like the corporate world, but it has its own special bullshit rat races, many of them motivated by making the university the most money via research or attracting the most students (again, to extract tuition, not out of any desire to truly educate these naive young people).

I've been a part of both worlds, and I'm probably more cynical about academia. At least companies are honest about their purpose.

The only reason I'm still working in academia is because I love teaching at the college level. Adore it. Like, imaging not doing it makes me break down and sob. If it weren't for that masochistic passion, I'd have noped out long ago. Truly, there is no reason to work as an adjunct unless you love students (check out the plight of adjuncts if you want another reality check on how ""ideal"" academia is).

You seem like you're in a rough spot, looking for a way out. I felt similarly back in 2010 when I was considering an MFA in creative writing. A few mentors gave me good advice-- that I could do it if I wanted, but it wasn't going to automatically turn me into a best-selling American novelist, or fix my problems, or be ""the thing"" that figured my life out for me. 

I ignored them and did the MFA anyway-- and they were right. It was an interesting experience, and I guess it taught me that I love teaching way more than writing, but 45k in debt and 4 years out of the program I'm still facing many of the same demons (depression, anxiety, chronic poverty) and now I have debt, lol. 

I wish for you that there were a magic solution, a one place and one moment where you suddenly felt: ""I belong here!"" I really do. But the more I go along, the more I think that people can only belong to themselves, that only we can give that to ourselves. It's hard, and I think it takes forever, but I suppose it's better than death. 

I also think that there are interstices in any system, little nooks and eddies where people DO care and DO do things for honest reasons. It feels worthwhile to me to ferret those places out, or make them myself (in my marriage or my friendships, for example).

do2qvrw,t3_751bia,,parkway_parkway,,"Hey, here's what I think. It might be bullshit so feel free to ignore it but you did ask for advice so here it is :)

&gt; They think anyone who isn’t constantly trying to maximise the amount of money they make is an idiot and that really pisses me off. My father works in a pretty big company and he’s probably the most miserable person I’ve ever met in my life.

These things are probably connected. Your father has tried to maximise money and it has cost him his happiness. He can either

* admit that maybe he wasn't so smart in his decision making and has paid a high price for that and encourage you to do better or

* bury his head in the sand, pretend that he did everything perfectly and put pressure on you to validate his decision by adopting his values.

It may also be linked with your depression that they are pressuring you as a way of not having to confront their own situation. If you go out and become a pool cleaner because it makes you happy that's going to force them to confront their own choices and evaluate what they've done. If you get a corporate job too and crush your feelings then they are saved from having to evaluate themselves.

IMO the general path to happiness in life is to find the things that work for you, find the people you like being around and live the life that resonates with who you are as a person. 

It's an iterative search problem. Basically the way people do it is to try something and if it works stick with it and if it doesn't to move on. Like dating, people try a dinner with someone and if it's great they have another and if it's bad they try someone else. 

The advantage of where you are is that you have been reflecting on what you are thinking of doing, that's great. IMO you become wise by reflecting on your life experiences. Wisdom is, I think, the art of making good choices. By reflecting on your choices, both those you made in the past and those you make now, you'll get wiser and that will improve things.

Wisdom is like the 2nd derivative of happiness. So being wiser leads to your choices improving and then over time a sequence of better choices leads to a better life. So it's really worth developing because over time it has a huge impact.

A PhD is a huge commitment which is difficult because it's not really conducive to reflecting / experimenting. A PhD should really be the result of trying some research projects and loving it, meeting a great supervisor and really liking spending time with them, thinking about your research problems in the middle of the night or on the bus etc. 

It sounds like you know it's not a great idea but maybe you're not sure what other choices you have. The one thing I can say for sure is that there are a lot of different ways to live. ",5,2017-10-08 14:06:24

At no point have you even *mentioned* what you're currently studying or what you'd do this hypothetical PhD in, which speaks for how little you really care for it. And an advanced degree isn't just ""solving a problem"". It's about being at the edge of what your field knows and making an original contribution to it. That's nothing like the problems you do out of your undergraduate textbook. There's very few people to give advice, and sometimes you have to forge ahead on your own. You can easily be stuck on a single aspect of your research for *weeks*, and if all you have is a desire to distract yourself and not lead a so-called ""normal"" life, then you simply won't have the motivation to keep working at it.

I definitely had severe depression issues in grad school. This was for a number of reasons - I felt isolated, I was very aware that most of my peers were smarter than me, and the lack of structure. For various reasons this changed in my last few years in grad school, although I crashed again in the last year.

My postdoc was honestly one of the best periods in my life. I was relatively responsibility free, but I was able to choose a topic I was super excited about again and work on it full time (I really fucking love doing research). Beyond tht: I knew I was actually getting to be pretty good.

Since then: things come and go. Sometimes work is amazing and I can't wait to start every day, and sometimes I have a hard time getting things done (sometimes for months on end). Sometimes I go through depressive episodes for no clear reason. Sometimes there is a reason. 

I can't tell you that things are *always* better. But in my experience: they generally are better than the dark periods.",2,2018-02-21 06:25:38
dukuxjh,t3_7z0abs,,ygnomecookies,t2_161bc2,"Absolutely. Depression/anxiety (anxiety especially) is really, really common. Not only is the environment stressful, but the kind of person who wants to pursue graduate work is typically someone who has a higher anxiety level - at least that’s what 2 different therapists told me. Go see a therapist that specializes in anxiety. You may need to be on short term meds, but maybe not. Either way, you’ll gain coping techniques that will help you even after grad school. 

Get a hobby that helps you unwind and let go of that anxious energy - like yoga, walking or running.

dukqbim,t1_dukf5ed,,RevisedMonk,,"This is my take:

During the PhD, everyone seems to go through some spike in depression/anxiety around years 2-3 as they try to get over the learning curve and become adjusted to the academic environment. Some people overcome this hurdle, and others don't.

For those that overcome the learning curve/adjustment, their depression/anxiety goes down steadily in the later years of their PhD and into their postdoc, perhaps except when it comes time to defend. 

But there are many PhD students that don't become well adjusted to the academic environment and their depression and anxiety just gets worse with time. As a postdoc, it seems like people in the latter group don't necessarily become more anxious, but they continually become more depressed until moving on to something else.",10,2018-02-21 01:57:52

1) Work with Zero Distraction: The most amount of research work I got done in any way, is when my internet is shut off. I got to a quick corner in my school's library and I use the K9 internet filter to get this done. It is free: http://www1.k9webprotection.com/

2) Organize your life: The best help for that is this guide by Cal Newport who got his PhD from MIT not working more than 9-5 M-F. https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586676/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1519028919&amp;sr=8-1
You can check out his blog here: http://calnewport.com/blog/ The best thing about Newport is that he is also an academic and so you can relate a lot to his ideas.

dtsoaj1,t3_7v5xl7,,Magenta_Tea_Kettle,t2_mzq97u5,"Hi! Female physics professor here.

First of all: if the student you worked with gave you issues (because you're a girl or because you're an undergrad, or even just because he could), let someone know. His advisor, or your advisor, or a different faculty member that you feel comfortable with. 

Like others have said - I worry less about what your advisor said just because I think you might be reading too much into it. I would use similar phrasing with an undergrad if they were expressing serious hesitation about grad school - I don't want to push anyone into it.

Finally, some things from my experiences. First, yes, physics is male-dominated. This can sometimes suck, but there are also a lot of good places - good groups to work with, great advisors, etc. If you do join a phd program, it might be good for you to choose an advisor who has a history of successfully advising women (and who has happy female students). Second, regarding enthusiasm - in my experience, enthusiasm waxes and wanes for many reasons. Sometimes my work is my favorite thing, and other times I have to force myself to edit papers in 15 minute increments. I've been on reddit a lot today, so you can guess which period we're in right now :). It's also very common for undergrads to get tired at the end. It sounds like you might want to go to therapy if you're seeing symptoms of depression in yourself.

One solution might be to take a year after you graduate and (if your supervisor is willing to pay you) work in his lab doing research. Finish your papers, and maybe start something new that you think might excite you. Alternatively - if you have a few papers in the works, someone in a tangentially related field might also be willing to hire you for a year to do something similar. 

My biggest worry from what you wrote is that you are (justifiably) burnt out and feeling unsupported. And if you had had interest in physics, and it had excited you until recently, I would in your position consider giving yourself a chance to recover mentally and to try to find that excitement again.",2,2018-02-05 23:45:02

I would recommend against waiting -- because if you miss another class and THEN tell him, it really will look contrived. If you say something in advance, at all, it will be a lot easier. 

If a student came and told me -- or handed me a note if talking is too hard -- that this had been going on, I would be very inclined to believe them. I failed a few semesters of college due to similar issues. 

I would not be able to offer accommodations by myself, but what I would do on my campus is offer to email the student success office on your behalf and to say that I'd spoken with you and could they please rush interview you. We are small enough that they would do that. I would only offer and not insist. 

Do you have any kind of student health clinic? Our campus nurses would have helpful information even if you couldn't afford to go see a doctor. They would be able to write a note. 

Even if psych services is not helpful on their own, a note from them saying that you are being seen for depression would be very helpful with getting accommodations, so I would make an appointment there too. ",9,2018-04-04 08:00:52

Speaking to a doctor isn't really feasible atm due to financial/time constraints. I've gone to our college's psychological services; it was a couple semester's ago, things were worse, and talking to them made me feel even worse so I stopped going. Usually, everything is manageable enough, and I just kinda wait out the more unmanageable times (I realize this is probably unhealthy). Do you think that if I went into psychological services, they might be able to write me a note for an excused absence?

&gt; If it's really impacting your ability to do work, then you need to get disability accomodations so that you'll be granted more flexibility and added assistance.

I'm graduating in a month and a half, and I think that process takes some time to complete.

They'll probably need/want medical documentation or disability accomodations to support that, since they need to bend the rules pretty far for you if you miss more classes.

I think I'll try to avoid mentioning ""depression"" specifically. And unless I'm actually in treatment when we meet, I'm not sure I feel comfortable saying that.

dwmjw3k,t1_dwmiyey,True,NoxiousQuadrumvirate,t2_kywisro,"&gt;What are you looking for specifically?

As I said in my original post, I'm looking for services that can give me advice and support. My doctors see the schizophrenia but don't see my academic lifestyle. My supervisors see the academic lifestyle but don't know what to do with the schizophrenia. The disability services see both the illness and the lifestyle, but they're stuck on the idea of schizophrenia in particular because it's rare. Someone below suggested ""Students with Schizophrenia"", which would have been great except they're not actually established yet, so they don't have any services aside from a single link to crisis hotlines.

I specifically don't look for that kind of advice/support on Reddit because schizophrenia is a complex illness and my life sits in a very delicate balance. 

Any advice which people offer me here will be shallow and won't have even half of the information needed to make an informed judgement. You can say ""I'm not a doctor and this isn't medical advice"" all you want, but if you're suggesting I take certain medications, start meditating, do CBT, change psychologists, etc, then *that is medical advice*. Maybe if you have depression or anxiety or any other non-psychotic illness, that kind of outsider input is valuable and adds to your store of knowledge. But the hallmark of my illness is an inability to judge reality and make logical decisions. Don't present me with multiple options which I then have to judge for myself and follow up on. My team has been carefully picked over a long period of time to only be people I would trust with my wellbeing no matter my condition. I need to trust the decisions I've made in the past, even if I can remember nothing before an hour ago. 

When I get ill, I am easily influenced by the suggestions of people telling me how to treat my condition, and that's really dangerous. I am unable to tell the difference between the person suggesting I discuss my medication with my doctor and the person who says I'll be cured if I stop all treatment and just drink more water. In order to safeguard against that confusion, I avoid medical advice from people who are (a) not trained to give it, and (b) not in possession of my medical files. Simply ignoring suggestions isn't enough; even being exposed to an idea makes it possible fuel later on. What I think in a single moment can undo years of careful and logical planning. 

Whilst I'm sure it's well-meaning, that kind of ""help"" is damaging. ",1,2018-04-01 13:38:47

This is really about people, and many people manage to have fullfilling lives still doing PhD. I think the most important reason these people get lost in depression is that they always aimed for academia and nothing else, and when they failed to find what they were looking for they are afraid to take a leap and make a change so they suffer. They practically pigeonhole themselves. And also as a characteristic they are very ambitious and somewhat high in vanity. When these get combined in an environment they cannot be the ""one"" they switch to dark side.

I took the leap, found a job, attempted another MSc, worked hard, and at least I know I did what I could do. I let myself to cool down, earn and ave money, travel and finally afford my hobbies and other stuff. But in the long run I cannot see myself working an office job all the time.

Obviously you have a passion for history otherwise you wouldn't be majoring in it, (and if you don't have a passion for it you definitely need to change you major right now, because I can't think of many other reasons you'd want to major in it). So its probably the work and the process that has you burnt out rather than the topic. I suffered both anxiety and depression while writing my graduate dissertation, which compounded my burn out pretty bad. For me, I just had to get away from it and stop thinking about how I needed to do something, etc. I ended up writing roughly two chapters of my dissertation while camping with my daughter and it was an amazing experience. I wrote it by hand in a journal, which prevented me from constantly hitting backspace, I had no internet, which prevented me from procrastinating by chasing down some citation or another. If I got to a spot where I needed to look something up, I just made a note of it to look up later. If I thought that maybe somebody had already said what I was saying before, or that what I was trying to say wasn't interesting, I ignored it (easy to do without internet or a library available) and just made a note to address later. Most of the time my instinct turned out to be wrong and would've just wasted my time otherwise. No Microsoft Word meant no squiggly lines under misspelled words. Even the tactile experience of hand writing versus typing helped me cut through all the bullshit in my head and focus on the ideas I was passionate about communicating.

However, I would like to kindly and respectfully say that your entire argument feels like, ""you're a guy and she's a girl thus because of the history of the world, you are at fault."" And while I understand that making her guilty until proven wrong puts a burden on her, you do understand that does the same for me. And while I understand I am the accused, a lot of the arguments you make for her being too drunk for X and Y can be applied to me as well.

And you know, I get it nobody wants to be the person who looks someone in the face and says ""hey you're wrong, you weren't sexually assaulted"" but every exemption you make for her being intoxicated can apply to me, you can't simply say that because men have a history of being predatory that I'm suddenly at fault and now assume all responsibility for everything that happened.

I know our situations are diffrent, and I'm in no way trying to compare or invalidate what you went through. while this may not apply to you, if I came out to the average person and said ""hey I had drunk sex with someone the other night and I think I was raped"" most people would be like ""No you just had drunk sex, it happens""

And that's what is frustrating about this situation because all of a sudden it's all my fault; nothing she did mattered. You paint this entire situation like I was the aggressor and she wasn't coming on to me. And that's what I'm trying to get at: sex is mutual and you can't just be like ""hey y'all were both drunk and unable to assume responsibility, but because she believes there was a lack of consent, you have to assume all responsibility because she's drunk and she's a woman and what she said was valid.""  

I understand that on a global scale, sexism is rampant. but you can't say ""she's drunk and she's a woman and everything she says matters, the rules don't apply to her but all of them apply to you."" because damn it my voice matters. You can't simply choose to accept her perceptive and overlook mine and call that fair, because this a case to case basis. And I get it nobody wants to tell someone who feels victimized ""you're wrong"", but I refuse to be pigeonholed into the predatory role.

And I do think I deserve a second chance at University because I was immature and reckless and took what I had for granted, and yes I understand I was 18 but you're telling me something that happened in my first 3 months of college, 6 months out of high school should determine the full course of my adult life?

I'm going to get 100% fucking real with you. I am strong, I've tried to kill myself 4 times within the 3 year span of this happening. I've developed social avoidant personality disorder because of being gaslit. There was a year and a half where I was scared of women and would bawl my eyes out getting naked infront of another person and it's still something I don't feel 100% comfortable with. I've fought depression and addiction for the past 2 years of my fucking life. I wake up in the middle of the night bawling my fucking eyes out becuase I feel like I'm back at that school. I did not stand up for myself when I was 18, I sat there and took it, I let everyone say ""this is your fault you are in the wrong"" and I refuse to let some jabroni on the internet tell me what I experienced is invalid, slander me, and call me a rapist and tell me that something that happened when I was 18 should determine the course of the rest of my life.

Glad I can help. I notice that often other people will give a person flak when they bring ""intelligence"" into a conversation. What those people fail to realize, I think, is that usually when an individual brings up the subject of intelligence, it's not so much about competition or a desire to be ""better"" then other people (I suspect that this assumption is the reason the topic rubs some people the wrong way-- one-upmanship is not an appealing behavior)-- it's about understanding one's role in the world and developing a sense of self. 

It seems you're suffering a bit of an existential crisis. This is not a bad thing-- in the end the uncertainty you have will be resolved and you will grow from it. For what it's worth, there's a psychologist named Dabrowski who did research on intellectually gifted individuals who believed that intelligence is positively correlated with a tendency to experience existential depression. Your tendency to ask questions is a function of intelligence yet the same tendency triggers psychological discomfort.

In fact, if you want a good framework for what an ""intelligent"" individual is, I'd look into research on ""gifted"" individuals. You'll find that frameworks for giftedness go well beyond ""getting good grades"" and actually often encompass personality traits and approaches to learning that are often typical of ""gifted"" individuals.

I have to go do things again, but I certainly have more to say in response to your post, so hold tight, I'll be back later... 

Edit: Okay, I'm back!

&gt; Anyways I dwell on intelligence because I have doubts about my future. I don't compare myself to the 99% who can't but to the 1% who can.

I think to everyone experiences this to some extent-- no matter how smart you are, there are always going to be people smarter than you. I have a hunch that this feeling of inadequacy never goes away. I've noticed that nearly all of my professors (who have PhD's in their fields) seem to have impostor syndrome. They call their colleagues ""brilliant"" but would never say the same of themselves. 

I, too, know that feeling of doubt. As young people in 2018, we must face job prospects that are not as friendly as the those our parents had. My parents were boomers, and they didn't worry too much about jobs. They knew that if they needed one, they'd find one, and it would pay enough to at least get them by. The world isn't like that anymore, and it feels as though we need to be better than average if we want a decent quality of life. The pressure to perform is real. 

&gt;  And this may seem unusual but receiving good grades is becoming a concern for me.

I don't know if what your experiencing is similar to what I experience when I do well in my classes, but I'll tell you what my experience is like and you can tell me if it's similar to how you feel. I'll mention that the reason I did poorly in high school was due to an undiagnosed medical condition rather than any sort of lack of effort, so that may play into my experience. For me, there's this sort of internal crisis that occurs when I get good grades because it indicates to me that I am capable of much more than I previously thought. For I long time I had convinced myself that I wasn't smart and that I should resign to a future that doesn't challenge my faculties. There's a sense of fear (good fear) that I experience when I succeed, because it means that the future may hold more options for me than I had originally thought. It scares me, a bit, that I don't know what my limits are. But again, of course, it's a very good fear. I was a precocious child, and that little bit of success that I achieve in school sparks this hope I have in myself that I am the same person I was when I was a child-- a person with potential, and person who, with blood, sweat, and tears, might just be able to achieve whatever it is she dreams of doing.  

Is it possible that you're realizing for the first time that you are capable of a level of success that you had not previously thought yourself capable? It probably seems odd, to most, that good grades would seem ""concerning."" I also understand this worry you have that your school is not ""up to par"" and that's why the A's are coming so easily. Coincidentally, I'm local to you, and I was told that the Rutgers-Newark STEM programs essentially ""are"" the NJIT programs (as in, you have to take most of your classes at NJIT). I don't know anything about Rutgers-Newark, but I can tell you that rigor of NJIT's courses are about the same as Rutgers NB's courses. You can also probably find old Rutgers NB exams if you Google it so that you can compare them to your own to see that they are about on par with each other. If you haven't taken any classes at NJIT, I'd suggest seeing if you can take one or two if you get the chance, because that will give you an idea of the rigor you'll find in New Brunswick. Unfortunately for you, Rutgers Newark isn't really an engineering school, so they'll be limited in what they can offer you (again, it's my understanding that they just make students take classes at NJIT anyway).

Falling behind due to lack of course rigor is a real concern, but that doesn't make you not intelligent-- just be ready to adapt to whatever gets thrown at you when you get to your new school. Again, this is something I've also worried about, since I am currently taking class at a CC. I'm a 2nd degree student and thus ineligible for financial aid, so as much as I'd love to attend a more rigorous institution, it would be a bad financial choice for me. I've had to be proactive in going above and beyond when learning material, and I will have to fill in any gaps myself when the time comes. Would I have gotten A's in the same classes at more challenging colleges? Maybe, maybe not. But in the end, it has no bearing on my inherent capabilities-- all it means is that I have to be careful not to have too many gaps in my knowledge. 

Wow, I've written a lot and still have more to respond to... I'm going to PM you the rest so that the rest of the thread doesn't have to suffer through my long comments...

What type of school are you at? Private, large public, research-oriented, etc? Where is the school located (US, Europe, etc. if in us, what region?)

What I would be most worried about for you though is that you seem to be under tremendous stress from a program that you make sound like should not be too hard.

A little about me: I am a professor of medical microbiology at a midwest university, although since this is my first time posting in this sub, I have not been verified. I have depression and an anxiety disorder.
 
To be blunt, it seems to me like the cultural differences and your illness are both (possibly) causing you to obsess to an unhealthy degree over your PI's reaction to learning about your illness and your past. I recognize this because I do the same thing. I am very glad that you are in counseling and getting help! I think that your counselor can help you see my point. 

You've described your PI pretty well, and I truly believe he's one of the good guys. I believe your fears are unfounded, and if you were to explain to him what your illness is and that you are getting help (without asking for any outrageous accommodations that would make you seem like a 'special snowflake'- as in accommodations that are beyond what your university's disability services allow) the only thing that would change is his understanding of you as a person. I worry about my students, and he's obviously worried about you. I know you are a private person (to an unhealthy degree imo) and you don't want him to think less of you as a person. This is completely understandable, but I actually think MORE of my students that have to fight mental illness (so exhausting) or other issues, but yet still kept up with their responsibilities in the manner you have. I can guarantee your PI would feel the same. Also, it seems you do not have a support system of older people that can guide and help you. I think if he knew more about your situation, he could be a mentor of sorts in that aspect, too, and I know that he would get fulfillment and satisfaction from that. Good professors (which he most definitely is) are there because they get great satisfaction from helping students fulfill their dreams. However, the good ones also know that life happens and often times also obtain great fulfillment from helping with outside issues as well (like your personal issues). 

This has already went longer than I intended and I apologize, but please know that I truly believe your fears are unfounded regarding your PI. I think he is someone that would appreciate knowing (and perhaps can offer some advice), and would absolutely not think differently of you or betray your confidence. I think that you would also benefit from an academic mentor like him that could also offer life advice and support you through your academic journey. FWIW, I also think that as long as you are mindful of boundaries (which I can never see you being unmindful of them!) he would also get personal satisfaction from helping you with all this. Please feel free to message me to talk further if you'd like. I also get great satisfaction from helping, and it would be my pleasure to talk further if you want! ",2,2016-10-21 18:23:12

**Mental illness doesn't mean ""not clever and destined for success"".** There have been successful and very successful people, including academic professors, who had or still have mental illness. Even the most debilitating and infamous types of mental illness.

I recently here mentioned a non-neurotypical professor (probably on autistic spectrum, but I don't know if ever diagnosed).

d2z8i7e,t3_4il07f,,MrSamsonite,t2_5lovx,"Neat question. The two obvious big names from Urban Planning are  **Robert Moses** and **Jane Jacobs**. They epitomize Modernist planning and Post-Modern planning, respectively.

**Robert Moses** was one of the most important non-elected officials in the 20th Century, with the most popular account being Robert Caro's massive biography, [The Power Broker](http://www.amazon.com/Power-Broker-Robert-Moses-Fall/dp/0394720245). He was a fantastically smart legal wiz who came to power in the 1920s in New York and was the standard-bearer for sweeping top-down government approaches to development. He used his knowledge and authority to gain more and more power, creating some of the first modern highways in bridges all over New York City and state that helped influence the Interstate Highway Act and the urban car-centric model. 

He can be viewed as quite a villain these days (think the unbridled power of Mr. Burns on the Simpsons), especially as academic planners now generally recognize the huge negative impacts that Modernist American planning had. There was massive economic and social displacement where things like the Cross Bronx Expressway ripped working-class immigrant neighborhoods in half, allowing commerce to escape urban centers and help create mid-century ghettoization. In short, the modernist approach can be seen as paternalistic at best and willfully concentrating power at the expense of the masses at worst. That said, depression-Era New York had huge problems (dilapidated housing and political corruption, to name two) that Moses' public works projects helped alleviate, and he was one of the country's most powerful advocates for public parks even in the face of massive growth and sprawl. 

Moses sat on countless commissions and authorities for decades, his power only finally waning in the 1960s as the top-down modernist approach of (Post) World War II America faced its loudest criticisms with the related Civil Rights, Hippie, Environmentalist, Anti-Vietnam movements: Americans were finally scrutinizing the ""Build Build Build Cars Cars Cars Roads Roads Roads"" model that had driven cities for decades, which brings us to **Jane Jacobs**.

Jacobs (who got herself a Google Doodle last week for her 100th birthday), was a Greenwich Village liberal and fierce critic of the Moses-type technocratic planning. She was a community organizer who helped stop Moses as he tried to push through plans for highways in Midtown and Lower Manhattan. For those unfamiliar, these are two of the economic and social cores of New York City - she argued that roads are supposed to serve us, not destroy our important urban spaces. 

If you ask a city planner what sole city planning book to read (myself included), the overwhelming favorite will be Jacobs' 1961 book [The Death and Life of Great American Cities](http://www.amazon.com/Death-Life-Great-American-Cities/dp/067974195X), the most important critique of modernist planning to date. Instead of sprawling highways and engineering projects, Jacobs saw the healthiest urban spaces as walkable, intimate, friendly and inviting and on a human-scale. She advocated for small city blocks, much wider sidewalks and mixed-use spaces instead of the classic Sim City ""Residential/Commercial/Industrial"" segregated zoning.

While there has since been plenty of critique of Jacobs' post-modern model, today's planning leans much closer to Jacobs' vision (at least in academic settings): Planners are more focused than ever on the post-modern walkability, mixed-use, high-density, equal-access, participatory planning model. Although this seems like a healthier place for planning than the Moses model of old, the academic ideals clash with the huge legacy of the Modernist planning approach (We can't just up and rebuild cities every time a theory changes, after all), along with the neoliberal financialization and privatization of so many of our spaces over the last few decades, so it's still as muddy as ever. 

Anyway, that's a slight oversimplification of some of the history, but Moses and Jacobs were certainly the biggest avatars of the Modernist and Post-Modernist planning movements and have been as influential in the field of planning as anybody. ",11,2016-05-09 23:22:24

No doubt in my mind that I wanted to get my doctorate and pursuing a postdoc career after that, hopefully leading to a TT, seemed like the logical, sensible thing to do. Heck, I couldn't even imagine myself doing anything else. I didn't believe I could..

I blame academia for having this tunnel vision and making it seem that every PhD should and will continue into an academic career. It's the only thing they inform you about. What they don't tell you is that most PhD's will actually end up outside academia, and they sure as hell don't help you getting there.

Meaning I also had to prepare a plan B and a plan C. This was a proper mindfuck for me. Academia doesn't support it's bright young minds if you ask me.. And that felt very unfair.

That's when I decided I wanted to take a brake from academia. I'm currently still working 2 days a week at the university to finish my tasks and projects. At the time of this decision a wonderful research project started at a university of applied sciences in my home town, on which I've been working 2 days a week.

d1ucuzu,t1_d1tylxx,,redbulls2014,t2_jpfpm,"Lack of focus could be depression. Before I realized that I was probably depressed, I wasn't necessarily calm but couldn't bring myself to do necessary schoolwork and felt very tired. I thought maybe its anemia, undiagnosed adhd, etc . . so that's what it felt like. 

I'm just trying to think of scenarios that you may or may not find familiar. 

- I was taking a class that centered around 3 main essays. I really loved that class and was great at debating in it. For each essay I had a lot of good ideas about what I wanted to write, and did endless research, but could not bring myself to write it until the night before when I was forced to by time pressure. The difference between how I did on exams and essays versus how I was in class was big enough that my professor called me to her office to talk about it. 

- I was planning a very big event for the club, and because there was a lot to organize I would just procrastinate and be very worried about it. It took place before I get treatment and was very successful. 

- I would come home from class and then just lay in bed / watch Netflix until I started to feel really bad and would just go to sleep because I could not focus on anything. That made me understand why sleeping too much can be a symptom of depression. 

On the other hand, before it started and after my stress and anxiety has been treated, I was and am a very calm person, so that was what I first thought when I saw your post. If things need to get done I will absolutely get them done - but I basically do not stress or freak out about stuff because that doesn't improve the situation. My dad is also very level-headed and I'm like him in a lot of ways, so that could just be my nature. 

I've never felt that depression / anxiety was a good description of my situation because I am never really upset or nervous/anxious. I would say I was either more restless or more complacent, and maybe angrier and more easily frustrated. ",3,2016-04-08 01:14:18

I would be careful taking those profiles as the only kind of adhd there is, as that book is mostly written about adhd hyperactivity type instead of inattentive type. If you're a lady you might appreciate the book Women with Attention Deficit Disorder, by Sari Solden.

A psychiatrist who is any good will want to know that you're seeing a therapist as well, so you might want to start there. Find a therapist, and tell them that you're concerned that this might be a problem for you but scared that maybe you're just lazy or just seem lazy. If the therapist is any good they should be able to work out what is driving you from focus.

One thing to note is that adhd medications make it possible to bring in the outer edges of your focus, what you do with the decreased impulses to distraction is entirely up to you. You may find that your study habits are absolute crap from having lived with this, and when you can focus you find yourself focusing on the distractions. You may not. 

A therapist should be able to help you work on better habits, a psychiatrist can prescribe drugs to help, and you should be aware that adhd is fairly heritable and has high comorbidity with depression, so if you have siblings who have been diagnosed that will help the psychiatrist, and you should keep an eye out for symptoms of depression since you are statistically more likely to have depression if you have adhd.

d7r6mfy,t3_537pq1,,the_banished,t2_clxic,"I went through a PhD program with really bad anxiety and depression, and I still see a therapist and psychiatrist 10 years later. I know how easy it is for the mind to spin any mistake that you make into a full-blown catastrophe. I've been there, so take what I say here as genuine concern for you and not criticism. 

One of my biggest challenges was learning that a functional adult is able to articulate their feelings and preferences clearly.  So, take your advisor's words at face value. Unless your advisor is sadistic or emotionally unstable, if she told you not to worry about it in her email, that's what she means. You said yourself that she's busy. If she really wanted to lay into you, why put it off for a face-to-face meeting. Furthermore, she knows you. This wasn't like missing a job interview, for instance. You have a working relationship with her that up to now has been flawless. What's the worst effect of this missed meeting? She momentarily looked for you, saw you weren't there, sent short email, and then had 19 minutes to work on something else. 

I know you mentioned that you were booted out of a counseling service. Was this something provided by the psychology department with grad students? I used to see grad students in the counseling program once a week for $8, and I found their services to be pretty good. i mean, they're doing it for a grade, so they have a strong incentive. If a program like this is what you were booted out of, are there other colleges nearby with counseling programs that could offer services on a sliding scale?

You aren't a weakling because you aren't able to go without sleep and self-care. A car can run great without oil changes and maintenance for a while, but eventually it will break down. You are a human being that requires certain things to live, sleep being one of them. There's no changing that. If you continue to ignore your body's signals for what it needs, you will drive yourself further into an anxiety and shame spiral. 

The basic concept that you need to start entertaining is that you are not perfect. Not only that, you *cannot* be perfect, and neither can your advisor.  Everyone fucks up.  Try as you might, you will make more mistakes. You will get papers rejected from journals and conferences. You will not come out of you program knowing everything there is to know. You will make some mistakes when teaching your classes. And so will all of your colleagues. 

Academia can be rough and, depending on the discipline and type of institution, rather cutthroat. The pressure to present yourself as the all-knowing wise professor with a firm grasp on everything is heavy. I was talking about this with a couple of colleagues the other day that I don't usually interact with. It turns out they struggle with the same thoughts and feelings that I have. These are normal things that our profession likes to pretend don't exist. 

Take some time to calm down from the adrenaline rush for fight-or-flight and objectively assess the situation. How big of a mistake was this, truly, in the grand scheme of things? Is this something that you would find unforgivable were the tables turned? I think in a few days you will have a clearer perspective.",5,2016-09-18 00:30:54

d7jldst,t3_52dbp8,,abandoningeden,t2_88w0e,"If you can't deal with 6 months of stress for the job market, then no, you are probably not cut out for an academic job. But having been stressed out and depressed doesn't mean you are not cut out for an academic job. I have dealt with major depression, had bad PPD while on the tenure track, went on anti depressants for a year and a half and then had a very rocky withdrawal that sent me back to being depressed for about 3 months in years 3-5 on the TT. I also have general anxiety disorder which sometimes makes me vomit from stress (Especially year I started/last year on the tenure track when finishing everything I needed).  Yet my tenure vote is in an hour and a half and I'm almost certain it will be a positive vote (don't want to say it's certain and jinx myself). 

Also re: constant level of stress, I found the instant I published the last article I needed for tenure my stress level went waaaaay down.  So it's not a lifetime of stress. It's about 5 and a half years of stress. 

Oh and I work at an R2 and I definitely don't work 40 hours a week most weeks. Usually more like 30-35.  With long breaks in May and August and December.  

You can always move from the tenure track to an industry job if you find you don't like it.  But it's hard to move back. I would say try for both and see what you options are. There's a good chance you won't get a TT job and your decision will be made for you.

d73ojzk,t3_50dpof,,poemchomsky,t2_bb15u,"So, I'm an extreme case.  Right out of high school, I went off to a good state school. I was NOT ready for college in any way. Not emotionally, socially, etc. Basically, I was that kid who doesn't know what they're doing in college... no goals of my own, no internal motivation.

I failed a lot of classes. I was about to be kicked out of school. I was genuinely depressed, and I failed classes because I couldn't really leave my room most days (not because I was out partying). I got some help and the university agreed to let me withdraw from the university... they didn't kick me out, but I couldn't go back. All those failing grades are still on my transcript.

I got some therapy for my depression, and I got a job. Honestly, the depression got better largely from working. I worked retail for about a year, and I felt competent and not so scared and overwhelmed all the time, like I had felt in college. After that year of retail, I tried going back to school. I petitioned my former school to let me back in, and it took months before they agreed.

Wash, rinse, repeat, I left in disgrace again with a bunch more Fs. It was too soon, in was still a mess, and I fucked up a lot.  I'm harder on myself about the second time, because I should have known better, I guess, at least enough to recognize that I wasn't ready. I really thought I was though. I wanted to succeed.

This is the honest to god truth. Although my transcripts don't say I was kicked out, I essentially failed out of university twice. My GPA from that school is like a 1.00

I then decided college just wasn't for me. It's not for everyone, we all know that. Went back to working retail. Worked my way up, became a store manager for a large national book store. I realized I was competent, I learned how to handle things like an adult along the way, including how to handle myself. Grew into myself, gained social skills and coping skills.

In my mid to late twenties, I developed a passionate interest in my current field. It was a hobby at first. I decided to take some classes at community college. I was terrified of failing again, and of what that would say about me as a worthwhile person. But I had found a subject I cared about, and I had grown up, and college came easily. Transferred to a different state university to complete my undergrad. Took my BA and taught ESL in Asia for a year, then applied to MA programs.

When I applied to grad school,i never lied about my academic past. I got into a decent MA program and worked my ass off. I knew I wanted to do my PhD, and I took PhD seminars as electives and basically did my MA the hard way to show I could succeed.

Got into a top 10 PhD program in my field, which is the best program in the US in my subfield. Basically I'm working with THE professor, the biggest name in my specialization. Never lied to him about my past, but don't go out of my way to bring it up. He was impressed with my work in the MA.

I've got some publications and some grants. I love my research and I love working with students.  I'm finishing my dissertation this year, and on the job market. I have every reason to expect I'll land a decent tenure track job. My professor has a great track record with his previous students.... his name as my chair counts for a lot.

Sometimes I think back on all those years where I thought college wasn't for me. It's pretty unbelievable to me...I really thought I just wasn't good at school.

d5pnl3i,t1_d5pgmif,,foldbackhandback,t2_xhq0z,"Thank you very much for sharing your experience. I have been through (and may relapse into) an extensive phase of mostly anxiety and some depression, and I do think very poorly of myself. I am glad (perhaps the counseling did work) that I could finally identify some issues and seek advice like yours on reddit!

Here is, then, a very important question. Should I tell my PI what you said (cultural background and strong supervision), thus admitting that I am performing poorly? 

My PhD advisor knows that I have been suffering mentally all these years and had tried to cheer me up with research about impostor syndromes (hence the title) and lots of advice on keeping a calm mind. 

He also gave me departing advice: never ever let anyone but him know that I am struggling. He said people will offer charitable explanations of my anxiety if I stay professional but will believe me if I say that I am not good enough for the job. That will kill my reference letters. Always pretend that I got it under control, he said. 

I think I could try to present the link you provided in a professiona manner, but I worry that my self-analysis would guide my PI's perception. In our annual review, he focused on asking me what I thought of him and our working conditions. I asked him where ""I can improve"" and he only said ""please, you should really be publishing, but of course that is what you are doing"". He seems to me to be a very respectable PI and will not supervise unless told.

Yet imagine what he will write when told... That foldbackhandback is inherently problematic because of the cultural upbringing? If I do not say a thing and work even harder and smarter, would he instead say ""poor performance at the beginning but amazing improvement and output at the end?

It is highly unlikely that those grades will be erased from your record, especially without medical documentation of what transpired years ago. Move forward. If you believe that clinical depression was a cause of your academic difficulties, start seeing a professional: mental disabilities can be bureaucratically tricky, and it may be helpful to have someone on your side. Again, your academic life is not ruined, but you do have to accept that kick starting it will not be as direct or easy as you may wish. You may have to move. You may have to take some unrelated Community College classes and get good grades. You may need to talk to a dozen universities until you find a sympathetic admissions counselor.  Be patient.

It was for a student who was smart and had good grades but missed classes and discussions a little too often (due to depression and insomnia although I'm not sure the prof knew that). He simply answered the student's email with something like ""I am happy to write a letter of recommendation for you, I think you are smart and capable. But, if I do, I will have to kindly mention your issue with attendance and tardiness. Let me know if you still want the letter"". The student said yes since he needed a letter from him and the admissions office made their decision based on what they had. I think a personal conversation may be harsh on someone with social anxiety, but an email letting the student make an informed decision sounds like the best option. Ultimately the decision on whether the student goes on to training school to become a teacher is hers/his and of the school's admissions office.

d50jnfq,t3_4reoz7,,cosmospring,t2_6c4kt,"&gt; The only reason I really went to grad school was because I was having trouble finding jobs (this was in 2010, when the economy was still kinda shitty)

This is certainly not rare, sadly...

&gt; Anyway, my point is that my project seems like it was pretty obscure and small. Is this normal? It seems like a lot of people write Master's theses that are more, well...meaty.

It's normal to have a project that seems, for your inside perspective, to be thin. You know your project better than anyone else, and that means you also know what its shortcomings are. Concordantly, from an outside perspective many projects will seem more impressive than perhaps is justified. Use this to your advantage; e.g., in an interview you can emphasize what the project did accomplish and how you accomplished it, and you can re-frame the shortcomings as ""lessons learned"" and as specific ideas for what a next version would include. You can do this regardless of whether you plan to write another line of code for that project, and this will often tell an employer more about why they should hire you than the actual project tells them.

&gt; It was a combination of a bunch of different factors, really - depression, loneliness, lack of motivation, lack of interest. However, I dragged myself kicking and screaming through it and finally finished my MS.

This is so common (or at least, commonly-reported) that it borders on the cliche. But you finished, and now you can focus on carrying forward what you did and what you learned (however ""piddling"" you perceive your accomplishments to be) and focus on finding out what kind of work you want to do that will not leave you with the same feeling that your M.S. left you with.

I'm not a mathematician but I imagine switching fields is possible; but you need the skills. Pick a field for which you know the basics, something similar to what you study but more applied. Learn the skills you need both at work and in your own time. Look at jobs you find interesting and talk to recruiters: find out what they want.

It's been difficult at times, but never more difficult than when I was having panic attacks, intrusive thoughts of self-harm, and actively alienating my now-husband. Two years later, I'm more mentally healthy than ever. I've recently achieved some professional success in academia too, but even that's relative because two years ago, I probably would still feel dissatisfied with what I've achieved now. It's more that I've learned to cultivate peace with where I am, my relationships, and my own journey. I don't care how old I am, what other scholars are doing, or how much money I'm making (although it helps now that I'm finally able to start paying back my loans, which I couldn't afford before!)

Counseling has helped me discover and advocate for pursuing what matters most to me in life.

d61h2tq,t3_4vsqv2,,HM_D,t2_find4,"I'm around your age, and also have a PhD in mathematics, so I don't think I have any wisdom that you don't have. Still, let's give this a shot:

1. As others have said, the question of whether you should leave academia depends a lot on your priorities (which I know nothing about) and your current academic options (which you've only said a little about). So, tell us a little about these things. For the latter, it is easier to get a handle on your research status if you say how many papers are (really, really) close to done, how many have been submitted &amp; where your two published papers are. For the former, tell us what you care about!

2. Literally anything else? As you know, programming/machine learning/actuarial science/finance are big fields that seem to often hire people with mathy backgrounds. However, I know plenty of people who flamed out of math PhD programs and did weird things (write RPG books, write computer games, found a travel company, get into lab biology, ...), and I did some myself (details omitted :) ). If you say where you'd like to live, people might be able to help more.

3. (also 4.) See 2.

The standard short answers, which I'm sure you've heard, are:

1. Two papers isn't a great sign after 6 years (unless they're in really good journals, or you've been unlucky in getting a pile of preprints through the review process). Certainly people with much better records struggle with getting any jobs at all.

2. (also 3,4) Learn to program, and ideally learn some data science or actuarial stuff. Apply everywhere. Get lots of help with the application process (knowing how to present yourself makes a HUGE difference, and it sounds like you haven't done much research into where you might work).

As for the rest:

I won't try to diagnose you over the internet, and I have no idea if you have depression. I do think your feelings are pretty typical (I know I spent a year in bed eating potato chips &amp; not talking to anyone when my math was going very badly, and many of my friends have had long periods of time when they couldn't face their work), but of course that doesn't help much. Doing something with more structure might help you feel better and get to work (I know it helped me). Almost anything has more structure than a pure math postdoc.

It isn't so hard to switch fields in math if you have a coauthor who is willing to help out. Doing it by yourself seems hard to me, but I haven't tried &amp; don't know anybody who has done it over a short time period.

I wouldn't worry so much about the weird teenage prodigies. There aren't so many of them - not even enough to staff the scientific computing groups in the handful of bigname companies. They'll get the first pick of jobs, but at the moment there are plenty of backup options.

Basically: you might be in a lot of trouble with continuing in pure math, but you almost certainly have a lot of options. Going to math events helps - especially if you make sure to spend time who might have industry contacts.

ddenhxd,t1_ddekva6,,emailanimal,t2_mkohp,"Reaching out to the departments is probably a bit of a stretch. 

Here is what I would do.  First, catch your current boss (I know you said you don't see much of them, but a 30-min conversation scheduled ahead of time should be feasible), and ask their advice.  Second, do the same with your Ph.D. advisor (a phone call).  They are in the best position to offer constructive suggestions and support.

Next, please do not underestimate your chances.  Do your homework. You are probably too late for this year's cycle, but you can use it to gauge the next year. Look at how many positions were available. I would go as far as create a spreadsheet with every single school (starting with Stanford and Harvard and all the way down to Alabama State and South Dakota School of Mines) that had a position open this cycle in your field. Read *every single* position announcement. Note any specifics (what specialization within the department was advertised, etc). Note any other things: teaching loads, expectations, etc....  File it all carefully.

*Then*, early in September (or late in August), go through the list of those departments and *find out who they hired*.  The hiring announcements often can be found on the web pages, so do your best. Research the background of people who were hired.  This will tell you what you can expect.

*Finally*, apply everywhere. Seriously. The marginal cost of a single faculty application is negligible. It is largely your time.  When I *needed* to find a job or else, I wound up sending 130 applications.  I could've sent around 170-180, but in my case there were realistic upper and lower bounds that chopped off top 20 places, and a few other schools.

Do not worry about teaching experience. If you taught classes when you were a Ph.D. student, this is excellent. This is often more than others would have. Tout your interdisciplinary research experience, but present is as something that can transfer into *other* interdisciplinary collaborations.  I used to work with medievalists and anthropologists. Now I work with microbiologists and political scientists (all - different projects).  Your discipline may not allow as much flexibility in terms of who your partners are, but your ability to bridge the disciplinary silos (*Strongly advertised* in your research statement) will catch attention.

Also the amount gpa matters depends on the degree program, I'd say a good minimum cutoff gpa for some of the better schools looking at applications would be a 3.0 so if you're above that you should at least stand a chance with all your experience etc. Lastly, once you've applied and get an interview you may be asked about those two grades, if you are it's totally reasonable to say you had some health issues that needed to be managed and it caused your grades to take a hit.

dexvcfy,t3_5zcizz,,Bonchee,t2_12rhfw,"First off, I wouldn't assume the responsibility as it could have legal/moral repercussions.  Secondly, as someone speaking from experience with extreme depression, I can tell you that depression stems from many things, but at the root, it's a programming/thinking disorder.  Your thoughts create your feelings.  Once you learn how the brain works, and that your feelings are caused by thinking, you can begin to train and reprogram yourself to recognize the thinking patterns and begin to get better.  An excellent book that details this is 'Feeling Good' by David Burns.  
  
In many cases, including mine, the person actually is suffering from a dysfunctional upbringing, sometimes as extreme as an attachment disorder (which was my case).  Children are imitators first and foremost, so if your parents are fucked up, chances are pretty good that you might end up that way too, depending on the level of neurosis that the parent(s) carry.  (Both of my parents also suffer from attachment disorders, although they will never come to terms with it).  
  
So in short, it can be fairly simple, but it is also extremely complex.  
  
It also isn't a silver bullet, and it's something that you must always be aware of and consciously work at.  The book details all of this, but so far, I found that utilizing these tools in my life are one of the only things that actually helps me feel better and I used to think of killing myself ~95% of the day, and now it is much less.  
  
It doesn't suddenly make life all happy and easy, but it does help.  
[If you look up Burns depression inventory](http://healingheartscc.com/docs/first_steps/FS_DepressionQuiz.pdf) and add up your score to see where you fall, you can maybe gain some empathy for your student and know what he is going through.  For example, I was 77 (extreme) and while I didn't make an actual attempt on my life, I did load a 12 gauge shotgun, put it to my forehead, and jam the trigger hard with the safety on to see if maybe it would fail.  I also did other more covert things that put my life in danger, but wouldn't count as an official attempt.  So I've been there, and know some of what it's like.  The book, and also realizing that no matter who the fuck you are, even if you have no arms/legs/dick/hair/etc, you are still a worthy human being, no matter what you have gone through- helped me step back from that ledge and begin healing from having very emotionally immature, controlling, insecure parents who made me responsible for their moods and emotions very early on.  They were not my caretakers, I was theirs, and that experience can really fuck up a child.  And there are many other forms of abuse that can lead to similar things.  
  
Anyway, this is probably one of the more extreme cases, and maybe your dude isn't dealing with all this, but just be aware that it exists, and sometimes it's not so surface level.  But the book can really help if the person opens their mind to the principles within.  Feeling bad and depression is caused by thinking patterns at its root, and can be lessened or at least contained when the person begins to realize that they have some 'say' on the issue and it isn't some uncontrollable 'chemical imbalance'.  (That's not to say that dopamine/serotonin levels/receptors aren't unbalanced, because they are in many cases, including mine, but I've never heard of a case where they are impaired enough to not be able to derive some control and contentment out of life.  I feel it's mostly the people stuck in the victim mentality that tend to use this as an excuse, however technically valid it may be).  ",1,2017-03-15 01:10:01
dexupl6,t3_5zcizz,,Zoethor2,t2_3al3q,"A lot of folks have weighed in from a professional perspective, and I don't disagree with their advice, but I wanted to offer some perspective from the student side of things if it is helpful.  I am a part-time PhD student/full-time employee at my workplace, and I struggle with depression and anxiety. I'm also pretty high-functioning and perform well both in school and at work. (I've been on a stable medication regimen for years, though my experience at least has been that it more takes the edge off than truly fixes everything.)

From that context, I would very much encourage you to ask the student themselves what you can do to be supportive, because it probably varies a great deal from person to person. For me, simple acknowledgment of my work and efforts goes a long way towards support. But another person might feel quite differently. If your student has felt comfortable enough to confide in you, I imagine they would be happy to hear you are interested in supporting them, and willing to identify particular things you could do. They might not know what those things are now, but opening the conversation will help them feel comfortable bringing them up, and it might be a topic they can address if they are seeing a therapist.

One specific item from your post that I want to address: depression can make even the things we are most passionate about fall flat. I would urge you to gently suggest your advisee wait to make decisions about things like switching topics or labs until they have a) talked them through with a therapist and/or b) gotten to a stable place on their medication regimen. This is professional advice, though it blurs the line into psychological, but you are in a good position to give it and it's important enough that I think you should feel empowered to open the discussion.  If they are truly discontent, then yes, they should consider changing their focus, but if their disinterest is a symptom of their illness, they should give themselves time to think about it in a clearer state of mind, rather than jumping in immediately trying to solve it.

All this said, good on you for caring and wanting to help.  While you are not a therapist, and I agree with other posters asserting the importance of not crossing that boundary, a mentor, friend, supervisor, etc. are all people who can still be supportive on these types of issues, and their day-to-day interactions can be extremely helpful in getting to a better place.",7,2017-03-15 00:56:56

you are using an extremely broad stroke to paint the academia as a bag of nuts. you do this based on a few acquaintances. by itself, this should be enough to discourage you from trying to make an argument, but OK. Say I tasted a couple of rotten apples and then go up to a mic in a room full of apple growers, and ask why all apples taste awful. This would only be acceptable if you didn't know what an apple was, or you don't know the minimum statistics, or if you are particularly afflicted by confirmation bias. 

How can you genuinely think that a whole group of people, you know, regular folk with the same depth of feelings and emotions, hopes and dreams, that you might qualify as intrinsic qualities of being a human, and wonder if they're all just a depressed bunch of weirdos? 

Hope this helped.

PS: had you asked: are academics more prone to depression then the average high-level employee, or some such, that would be a totally different question. we'd be debating statistics, control groups, experimental approach, sample quality, etc.

cxp0ak1,t3_3vn2rx,,SerHerpDerp,t2_bf93d,"I was prescribed adderall for several years and took it daily. While my diagnosis was ADHD, I can't help but think it was (is) actually depression. A close friend was also prescribed adderall and took it everyday as well. This is going to be a little scatterbrained, but I'll share my thoughts. 

Adderall, as I understand it, is all about dopamine. People with ADHD lack dopamine (think: reward, pleasure) in certain parts of the brain which leads to them to seek stimulation constantly; when treated with adderall, which (for lack of a better understanding of the neuroscience and pharmacology) increases the dopamine in your brain, they function like normal people. When normal people take it, EVERYTHING becomes rewarding. Tying your shoes feels awesome. Typing words feels awesome. Organizing things feels awesome. It transforms studying and homework, which ultimately aren't very rewarding experiences normally, into something very satisfying. It makes staying focused on that term paper or cumulative exam very easy - even fun, for some - because it becomes an instantly rewarding experience. It doesn't necessarily give someone an edge up, or make you ""smarter,"" but that's why people don't just ""study like the rest of us"" - it makes the work more rewarding. 

Now for the fun part. I quit taking adderall after my first semester of graduate school. I found that, while it was easier to sit down and write or read lengthy articles, my writing was TRASH. Just utter garbage. Everything I wrote down felt like the best thing I had ever said, so I didn't question my own work. I rarely gave anything I wrote a second look because surely it was brilliant. In reality, it was choppy, had huge leaps in logic, and was just generally pretty bad. 

I also quit taking it for a number of other reasons (irritability, I'd forget to eat for entire days, insomnia, shriveled weiner), but those aren't really relevant here.

Personally, I don't care one way or the other if someone who isn't prescribed takes it. They might have some added boost of confidence or focus over other students, but I don't think those things are an ""unfair advantage,"" especially in what I assume is your undergrad because you're talking about a floormate.

Consider that you will also need written academic recommendations from your professors.

I've had a lot of friends struggle with depression in undergrad. Grad school is hard. In most programs, almost everyone who gets in has top grades, and a huge number of students still drop out or just never complete because they cannot take the professional and personal stress. I would not recommend it as a career path for any of my friends who have struggled for depression.

If you are really serious about going back, and changing fields entirely, I would think you'd need to start with a qualification that will be the equivalent of a bachelor's in that field. Sometimes this is a second bachelor's, sometimes you can get a graduate certificate that will make up the difference. If you do well in that, and get strong grades and good recommendations from professors in that field, you might be able to continue on into a decent masters program.

In any case, if you really have your heart set on this you could work for a few years -hopefully in politics- and apply later with that to put on your resume.

After a really horrible one and a half year into my PhD programme in Food Science, I requested psychological help from the university services. After a few months, I was sent to my GP and put on antidepressants. The first drug gave me horrible side effects, so I was moved to another one, and started increasing my dosage really slowly to prevent any further complications. By that time my PhD had suffered a lot. I was really behind with my experiments, struggling with deadlines, I delayed working on my first paper for over 8 months, and some weeks I did not even show up at the faculty at all. But because I hadn't been diagnosed with anything, I could not file for any university support. My supervisor gave an me a three-month ultimatum to either start producing data and being productive, or he would rescind my PhD contract. At that time, I had to sit down and decide what I wanted to do. After a lot of pillow talk, I decided that the only way out was through (what a cliché!). And so it started some of my most stressful, but also satisfying time of my life. I worked for weeks trying to catch up on my work and research, while still fighting to get out of bed in the morning. Baby steps, for definitely baby steps forward. Of course I had weeks when everything seemed blue, but then you just to have to learn to assume that they are going to happen, ride the wave the best way you can, and then continue with your life. I finished my paper (with help from other people, especially friends), I progressed with my experiments and I started psychological therapy (CBT). I was diagnosed with bipolar personality with perfectionist conduct, that lead me to set myself goals so high that I am always going to fail them, therefore increasing anxiety and leading to depression (plus many, many other lovely things, hahaha). 

So now I am finally writing my PhD thesis, and I am aiming to submit by the end of summer, a few months before the end of my  4th year. It hasn't been an easy trip, and I am still finishing experiments, but I am positive that I will be able to do it. Now I think I made the right decision, but there were plenty of moments when I was ready to throw the towel and move on with my life.

So think about what you want to do, make a decision and stick to it. Start with baby steps, reward and congratulate yourself when you meet your own deadlines, and show the rest of the people that you are improving and ready to become a fully fledged scientist.

The upside to this is the same things you can do to feel better (e.g., stress reduction techniques, therapy, exercise, increased social support and engagement, possibly medication) will also help you with the cognitive symptoms you're experiencing.

The way you're feeling tends to be reinforced by the academic environment, but it's not a given. If you're at an institution of any size, I think a place to start would be going to their Employee Assistance Program/ whatever their local equivalent may be. They will have one.

""I don't think my postdoctoral mentors are going to understand these problems, or why they're affecting my work.""

Possibly true. Emotional intelligence certainly varies from PI to PI. One perspective that might help you if you decide to ask them for help with the things you’re struggling with, is that your real job (for both you and your PI) is to maximize your productivity over the long term in research areas you  care about. To do that for any extended period of time, you basically have to be healthy. Academia is a marathon, not a sprint.

Many PIs will try to get as much out of students and post-docs as quickly as possible, replacing them if they burn out. But this is short-sighted: as their careers mature, they are assessed more and more by the career trajectories of the people they mentor. That means if you can learn to do work you care about in a healthy way, you're actually helping them too.
For you, this sounds like it might mean accepting that you’ve slowed down during this transition for real reasons, and that you need put time and effort into learning how to address the causes of this head on.

Depression is very common in academia, so it's unlikely that prior experiences with it will be a problem, but you will need to be convincing about it not continuing to negatively affect your current or future performance.

criae5p,t3_36oyf7,,brynnvisible,t2_krgm8,"Honestly, grad school is stressful. That said, depression/anxiety shouldn't hinder you as long as you can remain aware of your own strengths and weaknesses (and you seem to be pretty good at that already). 

I think it also depends on your program and willingness to seek help when you need it, which is true for every grad student. I was also a test-centric student, but grad school is a definite shifting of the gears. Coursework alongside research was very demanding initially, but grad work has more long-term goals and (in my experience) that helped me to put the process into perspective.

It might also help to narrow down your choices by the types of student support, department relationships, potential advisors, and ongoing research available within them. Going to Oxford might be great for one student and an absolute hell for another. With your concerns, it can't hurt to take all of those variables into account when looking into prospective departments. Good research comes from a lot of places these days, but if you're not in a good mental or emotional place, how well can anyone expect to do or feel? 

Hope this helps! Good luck!  ",3,2015-05-23 08:29:42

if it is rejected however (worst case scenario), i don't know what to do. i do have issues at the moment that prevented me a) from studying and b) make it extremely difficult to sit an exam (even had I been able to study properly).

The admin/professors know that depression/anxiety is a serious issue and are subsequently quite understanding of the issue. 

In my honest opinion, I wouldn't go to the exam. You are only going to make yourself worse if you do. Just go sit somewhere and relax, listen to some music and just focus on anything but the exam. Don't worry about it being rejected, if it is rejected you can kick up a fuss through the appeal section which by then you could get yourself a more ""firm"" letter, possibly see another psychiatrist/counsellor.

csqbofo,t3_3bwfah,,smbtuckma,t2_78490,"I've been very happy with the therapist I've found in the last couple of years. My problems come in the form of social anxiety spiraling into depression, and stress impacts that progression and its intensity a lot, so he's helped me address that in a holistic way that I really enjoy. I have an antidepressant prescription, but he's also given me CBT to help me identify thoughts that lead to negative feelings and behaviors, be with them without feeling the emotion I used to get, and letting them go. I've also started mindfulness training to help with this, mantra meditation to get better at controlling negative emotions when they do pop up, and he gave me a lot of resources on improving my diet and physical health (as a lot of new research is finding that gut flora impacts brain function, plus what we already know about food and exercise impacting hormone balances). Finally I feel more motivated to make all these changes because he's an academic like me (continually reading new psychiatric research and publishing books) and so I trust his insight into my problems. 

Basically we agree on how depression is more a hugely complex psycho-biological system rather than a specific disease with one cause so it feels like a co-effort, and he's very patient and encouraging in my pursuit to address it.

cwxumym,t3_3sgyff,,Pteryx86,t2_cyp6n,"GPA is one of the most important factors in grad school admissions. Most schools have a 3.0 minimum and if you're near that minimum you will need really solid research/professional experience and references to counteract the low GPA. A 2.4 would be a huge red flag to any admissions committee. If you couldn't do well in relatively easy undergrad courses, how can they expect you to survive in grad school where the material is significantly more difficult and esoteric? If you are set on grad school, I'd recommend taking classes and getting your GPA up. Show that you can produce at the 3.5-4.0 level for a few semesters. 

Regarding the alcoholism, don't bring it up, it's not going to garner any sympathy with professors. If they directly ask about the reason for your undergrad grades you can spin it as ""personal issues outside of academics"" or something like that, but details will only hurt your chances. 

Also you should know that grad school tends to be a significantly more stressful environment and could make you even more prone to alcohol abuse.

cuddakh,t3_3i2oh1,,lespectador,t2_beid2,"I'm finishing up a PhD in film studies/philosophy/critical theory while at my first job (shout out to all the STEM folks in here who like to sneer at humanities degrees!), and don't let people discourage you on the humanities if you REALLY want to do it. But mostly, don't underestimate how shitty the prospects are for gainful employment in academia after (or outside of academia for PhDs in our fields doing work relevant to what we research...) and also how shitty grad student life can/will be (massive poverty and debt, insane hours, living in shitty places, depression/being surrounded by depressed people, waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat for years over the job market as you watch your friends submit 100+ application dossiers and *maybe* get 2 meh interviews at places they would never want to live/work at if they had the choice, etc).

That said, since you asked about getting in and not about what to do when/if you get out of grad school -- if you're really, really, REALLY sure you want to do this and you're willing to make massive sacrifices, here are a couple of ways to better your chances given your circumstances:

- Have a coherent research area. Know what your major field and your minor field will be. Have an idea of what you'd like to specialize in for each. Have a coherent, intelligent project idea, even though it'll only be an initial one. Should be original and compelling. Develop a fantastic pitch for it. You'll really have to know your shit for this.

- Research types of grad schools and programs that would be a good fit for you. Find faculty at these schools whom you'd like to work with (potential advisor, committee members) and reach out to them. Do so in a way that demonstrates your commitment to your research areas and project and that also demonstrates that you've researched their schools/them and are seriously interested in them  (not in a way that just makes it seem like you're trying to get your foot in the door at any grad program that'll have you). Seek them out as potential mentors. Get them interested in your work and show them your unbridled motivation toward your project.

- If you don't have the grades to back you up, then you'll have show your qualifications for grad school in some other ways. Some of these qualifications are things like mature critical thinking skills, adaptability, intellectual creativity, commitment to a long-term project, ability to put your head down and work... Find ways to show admissions committees that you're capable, motivated, can handle it, and can get it done in 5 years (good or bad, this is the target time frame that they want to hear).

- You'll need a really good dossier. Solid cover letter. Solid rec letters. Solid CV. Solid writing sample. If you didn't study film/cultural studies as an undergrad or if it wasn't your major, you'll need to really justify that you'll be able to do graduate-level work in these fields.

- Brace yourself to take out a bunch of student loans. Grad stipends are meager, many people accepted to grad programs don't even get an offer of a funding package anymore since the budget crisis, and packages that do exist have been frozen since about 2007 with no adjustments for inflation or anything like that. Stipends also require you to work a lot -- teaching takes a lot of time and has a lot of invisible hours (grading, prep, meeting with students, lots of other sorts of meetings), and this happens while you're a full-time student as well. Have a plan for how you'll support yourself if you don't get (full) funding, and have a plan for how you'll be able to feasibly get your degree finished in 5 years knowing how much you'll be working. Edit: And don't just have a plan; convey it to the schools you're applying to.

- When dealing with faculty at the schools you're interested in, you need to demonstrate maturity/intellectual maturity, responsibility for yourself, independence, motivation, and stability. You want them to see you as a young researcher in their field, not as an undergrad moving on to the next step. Edit: So try to stay away from the sob story when dealing with them. If you had circumstances that are relevant to your situation that they should know, then by all means go ahead and explain, but if it's just ""I hated my old major so my grades sucked"" that's probably not great. They will want to see that, if there was a problem, you've overcome it and will not ""relapse""/return to old ways if they take a chance on you.

Stay realistic and do good work. Good luck to you! Film/theory is a great field full of brilliant people and brilliant work.   ",16,2015-08-24 00:30:58

I have been in this grad student's shoes, due to some personal problems and some incompatibilities with my supervisor which made me lose all motivation in my work and simply stop caring. Believe me when I say that asking for constant check-ins, constant meetings, an automated system which asks you what you have done today, monitoring her, or all those kinds of insane ideas that I see on this thread are not solutions. These  are techniques and tools, and they can work *if* they are agreed to and used willingly by all parties concerned, not imposed from one side to another. They are communication &amp; reporting tools, not some sort of academic panopticon.

Go have a sit down session with her, possibly outside of the lab (so that she can speak freely), and have a honest conversation about her performance issues. Ask her why it has been the case when you know she has the mental capabilities to do her job. If she has personal problems, try to give her an elegant way out (can she take a leave of absence to work on her problems, or be reassigned to something else temporarily?) which is not as humiliating as ""you failed your research, get out"", or ways to solve them (maybe she needs to see a therapist? this lack of motivation can be a sign of stress-induced depression, and it was in my case, and therapy can always help). If she has problems in the lab, try to discuss options as to how to solve them. Only discuss feasible options, there is no need in discussing solutions which you know are not feasible, but it's usually not too hard to find good compromises that show that you care.

We had gone out to look at house in sub division  relatively close to private school that i ahd been accepted to. IF, on leaving that house, My father had not decide to head  toward lake ponchartrain and go around the block,  The would have never seen the  for sale sign on the house that my arent's bought, That was 1960.   The house cost 25,00, seller was vet, So the mortgage which my parents assumed was ridiculously low because the origiowner was a veteran. My parents had Saved 10,00 as down payment.   The house was built in 1955 and was added onto sometime within that 5 years . My fat it was a 20 year  morgage.  My father  paid off the Rest of the morgage  in 1984.. 

 Notice the more than 15 year time gap. I'm no longer sure  when my father got Tenure anymore. Tualne does NOT pay well. In the late 1960's  and early 1970's my father/s take home per month, after deductions, which incuded a deduction for a parking permit to a parking  place At the downtown Medical school cam[pus. was 4.00

 The way faculty members eventually get to the point  where they can buy a house is often years of financial bui planning, and  these days  usually means  working  ad additional  or 2 part time jobs.. My closest friend became an M.D., along with her husband, , who is also an M.D. Work Taught music lessons while they were in private practice, now they are both full time faculty members at health scinces technical college. She was working  two part time jobs, but  when she  became full time faculty, she resigned from the part time at a clinic, for reasons similar to the  why she had resigned from a aprt time job after Katrina,. She still has a part time job at two nursing homes,, and that part time employer  wanted to add a third nursing home. They have 2 mortgages,  after katrina,  they wer put their house on sale. It's a HUGE house. The architect  is former classmate of mine..999.

 Financial palnning,  and SAVING  money, and in vesting money and in heriting  Mobil stock from his father who workded at Co for Con as Piple fitter . all figured into this.. You can use money to make more money. , but how much risk you are willing to take can be big factor if you have stock. You are looking at 10 year or longer commitment to buying a house. Qulity of life. Which maters more to you. Your reputation among your peers, your professional reputation and appearance. Or Whether  your significant  other  and children can live comfortably.

Money was never the most important thing in either of my parent's lives. Other people's opinions  didn't matter much either. My father turned down the chairman ship of the parissitology because he did NOT want to administer  a deparment theat  went through it's annual photocopy allowance in the first 3 weeks of January. That also meant turning donw  a promotion and salry  increase. He wanted to teach  and mentor graduate students.  My friends husband has also turned down the Chairmanship of  of the  a biology department for pretty much the same reasons. He has standing offer from a group of cardiologists if he ever wants to go back into private practice. he almost  practiced himself  to death, literally. My friend gets her contact with patients at the nursing homes.

 If money,  peer pressure and status and envy and jealosy are your motivations, I pity you.

cyj6mix,t1_cyhvmp6,,proteins911,t2_o4grc,"&gt; My advice here is to tread carefully with the ""medical condition"" explanations; too many of us are skeptical of overdiagnosed medical conditions. Take that advice FWIW as I know next to nothing about your situation. But if your other credentials and recommendations are strong, my advice is to emphasize those aspects of your portfolio and limit the amount of excuse-making you are (rightly of wrongly) perceived to be doing.

I completely agree with this advice. I'm a first year PhD student who was diagnosed with depression and ADHD half way through undergrad. My grades dramatically improved after starting treatment but I didn't mention the grades or conditions at all in my application! My bad grades were actually even worse than yours and included 2 Ds and 4 Cs. Looking at my transcripts, its obvious that I had some struggles but eventually turned things around and excelled so I don't think mentioning it would have helped much.

Compare, for example, to clinical depression as a psychological disorder.  A person who is clinically depressed can reason out that there is nothing in her life to be depressed *about*, but that will not stop the disorder.

Your university has counselors, who have seen impostor syndromes before, and would have ideas about what you can do to minimize it.  

&gt;shudder about attending workshop because it means setting my work side by side against people who (in my eyes) write so much better than I do and are so much more accomplished. 

This, to me, is the quintessential telltale of an impostor syndrome: when one compulsively compares one's work at *all* stages of development to the *finished* product of one's peers.  It's particularly devastating in graduate school and academia, since so much of one's work is done alone and in private, with revisions upon revisions, while one's peers really are the elite, and they are really good at selling their final product (just as you are).

That depends on your definition. I've not been to therapy, nor am I medicated because . . . 

&gt;What is your financial situation?

Not good. 

However, having identified my depression and social anxiety has given me opportunity to cope with it. Just knowing what it was has made life easier. I've become much better at recognizing when I'm having an anxiety attack and when my brain is yelling ""FIRE"" just at the sight of a matchbox. It's given me opportunity to fight against it, and my girlfriend is good at calming my nerves. 

&gt;How many credits do you have and what is your GPA in them?

Not sure. It's been a long time since I've seen my grades. I would imagine it's fairly abysmal. Something like 2.5. 

&gt;I think if you go to your professors just with a specific idea or question, like ""what schools do you think I should aim for?"", they will be able to help you.

I've asked that of both professors, and neither felt they knew enough to give me any real answers. The Stanford grad I mentioned has since retired and is damned difficult to get ahold of. Before he retired he was about as uninspired by the current educational system as I was, often referring to himself as a kind of academic Sisyphus.

My writing doesn't give me much anxiety. It's really the one thing I know I have a handle on (as much as a writer can have a handle on their work).

Major depression aggravated by the duress of education. DO NOT GO TO MED SCHOOL. Seriously, you very well may kill yourself. It is extremely stressful, assuming you can even get it.

The good news, you should not let your GPA stop you from applying to grad school, BUT you should compensate with an applicable work history, a record of relevant skill building, and some impressive recommendations. Scoring well on the GRE wouldn't hurt, but that isn't as critical.

Scores from 7 years ago are basically irrelevant. More damning/beneficial will be what you did with yourself since then. If, for the last 4 years, you have done nothing relevant to the degree you are going to pursue, then you are in some trouble. You would be better off spending the next year or two self training in the field, privately and, if you can, get related work as well. For instance, if you want to work in medicine, you had better be working in medicine now. Be a volunteer, go to community college and train in something basic, like phlebotomy (your bio degree will speed you through that if they don't declare your credits too old.) On the other hand, if you have been involved with patient care, this is a good positive for you. In that case, you may want to find a graduate certificate in something related to your interests, and use your performance in that along with nailing the MCAT as a demonstration of academic skill.

Probably. I'm a third-year jr. prof., TT-R1. The two emotions I most associate with this situation:

1. **Postpartum depression.** [The Web page from Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/postpartum-depression/basics/definition/con-20029130) describes it thusly: ""The birth of a baby can trigger a jumble of powerful emotions, from excitement and joy to fear and anxiety. [...] some new moms experience a more severe, long-lasting form of depression known as postpartum depression. Rarely, an extreme mood disorder called postpartum psychosis also may develop."" Now just replace ""birth of a baby"" with ""defense of a dissertation"" and ""moms"" with ""faculty members"" and ""postpartum psychosis"" with ""making full professor.""

2. **Tenure is the real Ph.D.** Being junior faculty is not like being a grad student. However, the pursuit of tenure may feel like the ""real goal"" after the reality sets in of the Ph.D. as a terminal degree that gets you an entry-level job, albeit the best entry-level job ever.

How to deal? A piece of advice among many: Remember that **motion is not progress, no matter how much if it there is.** Academics love to chime in about how many hours they work, but it's a trap. Unless you bill hourly, it won't matter how many hours you work or how little sleep you'll get. Focus on results, mitigate distractions, and have/stick to a plan.",21,2016-02-19 19:07:12

It also allows for more exercise and externally directed goals (which are things shown to counter depression). Academia doesn't always value the pack, though it would be better off if it did.

d01qov8,t3_45uqjx,,0149,t2_ckf6i,"OP, I agree with everyone else who says that you should consult a professional, not a bartender, about your depression. Your therapist can give you a prescription, and I think the more important is that your therapist can  re-program your automatic thoughts.

You're catastrophizing. I'll say it. You've internalized a bunch of automatic thoughts, and that's the cognitive equivalent of tripping down a long flight of stairs. Here are a bunch of things that you said that are probably automatic thoughts, and not really accurate reflections of reality:

&gt; there was no jubilation

Well, what did you expect? You just completed a huge effort; you're probably exhausted. I know that every time I finish a marathon, I think ""meh,"" but that's just because I'm fucking tired. You'll feel better about this when you're less exhausted.

&gt;I have no desire to move to some shitass tiny college town in Fucksville, USA

Nobody is going to make you do that. But you have to realize this: whatever problems there are in Fucksville, USA, your condescending attitude is making things worse. When you sneer at a potential employer, you're completely blinding yourself to all of the benefits of Fucksville, USA. 

There is a young queer entering Fucksville College in 2017, and this young queer has never before enjoyed the company of open-minded professors or open-minded classmates. You think it's bad to live in Fucksville? What about the farm boys who like to wear dresses? They're dying to meet you, and your first chance to meet them is at Fucksville College. They need you. You can change their lives if you can only get over your preconceptions about Fucksville.

&gt;I should be ecstatic probably.

Again, why are you setting expectations so high? You're exhausted. Cut yourself some slack. You can't feel ecstatic until you cut yourself a little slack. And besides, living in the city per se is probably not the kind of thing that normally puts people into ecstasy. Ecstasy usually comes from moments of transcendence or fulfillment. And those things are extremely rare; some people live healthy lives without ever feeling ecstasy. So for the moment, cut yourself some slack.

&gt;And it's a bit late now for regrets.

There is life after the 20s. Surprising, right? People go to college, join the army, go to physical therapy, and pick up the pieces in their 30s. It happens every day--even in Fucksville, if you'd bother to learn about it. Life goes on. You can always make a change, for better or worse. The decision is yours. It's never too late to get your values straight.

&gt;Honestly, I think I just want to get a mindless job for a while and spend some time becoming a person again, but I have no idea if a fucking PhD could even get a mindless job in the first place.

Now you're just being ridiculous. Of course you can get a ""mindless"" job. But if you're being honest, you're really only entertaining this plan as part of a line of self-defeating thoughts. You're setting expectations so low so that if you fuck up, you can finally prove to yourself that you're an irredeemable failure. But you're not; you're only fooling yourself.

&gt;It's no heartrending lifechanging intense pursuit of passion, just a lot of frustration...

That's an understatement. You're making yourself frustrated, and miserable, by holding yourself to impossible standards. You have to start practicing a little self-forgiveness before you curdle permanently.

d00hbhe,t3_45uqjx,,bitchwithacapital_C,t2_jvm1w,"First, let me say that depression is a jaded bitch that will convince you she's right that you are worthless and know nothing. While you may never get rid of her entirely it helps to have tools to make sure you can deal with the thoughts of being totally useless. So kudos for trying to see a therapist...hopefully you can get a good one. 

Some other comments have already alluded to this but once a little of your depression fog lifts you can try and focus on how what transferable skills you have...and there are PLENTY. Anyone who has gotten a PhD has some basic ones: the ability to focus on a topic on which you are LITERALLY the only expert for an extended period of time, the ability to solve problems/make connections no one has before, the ability to communicate your ideas in various ways, etc. Then you should try and figure out what kinds of jobs these skills might be useful in that you might want to do. I have a good friend that went from a mechanical engineering PhD in which she studied car braking systems to becoming a consultant at a top firm in the world. Her resume was like: ""I know how to solve problems."" Now she works at Google (not on their cars). It can be done. 

But it's not easy. You can try and find some mentors who can help you. Is there anyone you've met in your time getting the PhD who might be at least willing to look over a resume? Or maybe you can try and find alumni in fields you're interested in and want to know more about. If possible, have support as you embark on a job search no one actually prepared you for. 

And lastly, know that after a bit of time having finished the PhD you will have some perspective that you simply cannot have while you're in it. You may regret it later...you might not. But how you feel about it as it ends is very much not likely how you will feel when you look back on it. It just takes some distance. 

I really do wish you the very best and hope that you find a special place in the world to show off and improve your talents. ",2,2016-02-15 08:43:03

&gt;my chances of getting into a top 20 school for biology is slim to none

So what? I see people **all the time** on this sub who insist on getting into a ""top program,"" or who feel the need to let us all know that they're in a ""top 10 program"" in whatever.

Here's the thing. Programs change as faculty come and go. A top 20 program for X or Y five years ago may no longer even exist in some cases, or at the very least may be significantly lower-ranked if the faculty member(s) who helped make it a top program either relocated to a new university, died, or retired.

For my master's degree, I went to a school with one of the top 5 programs in underwater archaeology in the US. A year after I began my program, they started a PhD program. Five years after I graduated, the entire graduate program was shut down because of faculty infighting and other problems, and only recently has managed to get its master's program reinstated.

I attended a university for my PhD that as far as I know, is not in the top 10 (maybe not in the top 20, but I have no idea) for anthropological archaeology in the country. You know what? It doesn't matter. I graduated in 2014, I'm currently successfully employed in my field, and in the fall I'll start a tenure track position at a 4-year university. Is it the best university in the country? No, but it's a state university in a place that is interesting, the pay will be equal to or better than that of people I know who are also new t-t faculty and who graduated from better programs than mine, and my research is largely self-directed with little need for much in the way of external funding until I decide I want to apply for it, in which case I'll have university support and should have no trouble convincing the NSF and other agencies to pony up the money.

I wanted a smaller university where I could teach *and* research. I got what I wanted.

Students on this sub seem to obsess about program rankings, but program rankings change. If you can't get into a top 10 or top 20 program, it's not the end of the world. Focus on finishing your degree and decide then where you want to go.

I won't lie and say that the program you come from makes no difference in future employment. There's a reason that my friends from other, better ranked, programs got hired right out of their PhDs and it took me an extra year to find a position. But ranking doesn't mean everything, either.

I know a guy with an amazing publication record who *did* graduate from one of the top anthropological archaeology programs in the US, and he was unable to find a tenure track position at all. Another friend (well, acquaintaince-- I don't like her that much, but we're on cordial terms) of mine had a great pub record, came from a relatively highly ranked program, and is at a university not all that much different from the one I'll be at.

The point is, don't obsess about the ranking of programs. It's only a small factor in how your career will turn out. People, including future employers, care ultimately about what you've done and what you'll do, not where you went to school. While those aren't independent (good programs often push their students to publish more), they're also not so intimately related that you can't stand out even if you're not in a top program.",7,2016-02-13 15:46:27

For the most part, I don't think about my students. My perceptions of them are based almost entirely on their work, which in my opinion is a good thing come grading time.

When I am forced to think about them during instruction, I guess I'd say that instructors universally like students who contribute positively to the class, which usually involves participating in discussions or asking meaningful questions during lecture, and not asking questions solely intended to make the questioner look smart, which are easy to identify by both instructors and students. As far as I know, none of my colleagues have ever labeled students as ""keeners"" or ""gunners,"" publicly or privately. We talk about students, but it's usually along the lines of, ""yeah, she's really sharp"" or ""ugh, I spent my entire office hours answering his inane questions when I needed to get some work done.""

My classes tend to be large ones, so I can't tell when students are having personal issues unless they bring it to my attention. Having personally struggled with depression and having had other shit happen in my life that made working difficult at times, I always give them the benefit of the doubt and try to accommodate them within reason, even if I know some are lying to me. You would not believe how many relatives die and cars break down around exam time or when assignments are due, but I've never asked a student to provide evidence to substantiate their excuse. My number one priority is my research, as is the main priority of most university faculty - that and getting external funding, so I try not to concern myself too much with the goings on of my students' personal lives. I figure, even if a student is making up an excuse for missing a deadline or whatever, if it helps them out and barely affects me at all, what do I care if they turn in an assignment late?

So yeah, ultimately students are among my lowest priorities and I rarely think about them. Hopefully a SLAC professor would give a different answer, but I daresay most of my colleagues at large universities would agree.",6,2016-02-02 01:29:28

I'm coming at this from a very biased perspective, not to say you won't do fine at the internship, but be sure you're moving to something and not away from something.  

Regarding point (2), your grad student understands that that's a risk he takes.  He won't take it personally.  Do what is best for you, don't worry about hurting anyone's feelings.  Absolutely do not stay in a bad position out of guilt.  ",2,2014-11-24 07:05:35

Based on those things last mentioned, how did you reach the conclusion that I think highly of myself?

I've actually dealt with social anxiety and depression in the past mostly due to feelings of inferiority. I still don't think of myself as anything more than average but I do think I can make a contribution to society in some way... maybe I feel like I need to *prove* myself? I have always been an underachiever, didn't really excel in anything. I see all my friends, most of them are huge successes... and I'm just floundering. Shit, my cousins are amazing too, my little sister excels in school. I feel really inferior a lot of the time.

chhmbzb,t3_25gzx7,,[deleted],,"Molecular biologist here with dyslexia, language learning disabilities (is this what you meant by LDs?), major depression, and major anxiety disorder. I'm also the first in my family to go to college, so i had no idea what i was getting into.

First off, like the others have illustrated, a Fail looks worse than a drop/incomplete. Both will affect your GPA, and more importantly, your confidence as a student.  Well, fuck all that. A future employer isn't going to look at your transcript, especially your second semester's coursework.  If you end up applying for grad school, the diminished GPA will matter to some degree, but it'll look really good if you get better over the years. In my own case, i graduated cum nothing with a 3.3 GPA and just left it out of my resume. Looking good on paper really doesn't take you that far. Now relax and take a deep breath.

Having a learning disability doesn't equate incompetence or lack of intelligence.  You are a unique individual with more neuronal synapses than there are stars in our galaxy.  Thus, you definitely have your own learning style that works best for you.  College is the time to discover those methods and align your strengths with your intellectual passions. Only you can know what those elements are, but i can tell you about my own story and what i learned. I hope that you can translate it onto your own life.

I haven't read a book since middle school because i could never keep track of the characters and plot. I would have to re-read sentences while constantly misinterpreting overarching themes and situations. I always knew this about myself, but i stubbornly read and read and read to no avail. I just thought i was dumb. It took me a while, but I found that I better understood my courses when i focused my attention on the conceptual instead of reading a chapter over and over, sentence by sentence. I'd try to sift through the bullshit jargon and make a diagram to see what's going on. By the time exams came around, i'd go through all my notes and essentially construct a big ""cheat sheet"" listing definitions/formulas/whatever with descriptions in my own words. Just by going through that process, i usually remembered the majority of the material. The other parts that i couldn't remember, i'd write it over and over and over until i had it down or just said fuck it. This got me through most of my general requirements, but i promptly forgot everything once the course was complete. Essentially it was a big fucking waste of time and energy, but you gotta do what you gotta do.

Even when i declared biology as my major, I didn't really didn't have a handle on my learning style. I took psych, bio, latin, math, philosophy, etc... and just chose to major in the intro class that i did the best in. I started junior year at Carleton with only bio 101 and 102 under my belt. Luckily, I had wonderful professors who relied heavily on lectures and hand-drawn figures. At this point, I really didn't need to read the textbook unless i missed a class or something.  I paid attention and drew all the weird blobs in different colors with arrows and labels pointing this way and that. I only really needed to write out a cheat sheet, make a bunch of drawings from scratch of all the various pathways and whatnot, then quickly reviewed the forgettable material right before the exam. Even more fortunately, i started really getting into my classes, especially the hands-on lab stuff. That's when things started clicking. 

If you take anything out of this lengthy spiel, please take this to heart. You will do so much better in classes that you enjoy. If you figure out the best way you can learn, I'm sure you'll use your own methods to really sink your teeth in and understand the lessons.  High school taught us to read, copy, and regurgitate. If you really find yourself passionate about computer science, you'll be way more attentive and willing to put the effort to puke out answers/code on your exams.  If you develop a sense of self, personality, and genuine curiosity, you'll internalize the information and attain a deeper understanding. That's what the professors are testing you for, not if you remember example 2 of lecture 14 page 628.

So yeah, right on for being ambitious, but you gotta figure out what you love before committing.  Once you love the intellectual pursuit of something, then really nothing can get in your way.  Not even getting shitty grades from a most likely shitty teacher can stop you.  But, you got a lot of life ahead of you, so figure out yourself while you can afford some errors here and there. And NEVER force yourself through a major/profession. You have the opportunity to convert your learning disability into the strength of adaptability and critical thinking. And NEVER be ashamed of failure. I don't know about data science, but majors are generally meaningless. It's the skills you learn from the major that become the assets upon which you build your career.  I'm only 26 and still working on that.",3,2014-05-14 09:51:09
cgu0rl3,t3_2367p0,,starduster,t2_3d4mh,"Agree with everyone else who responded so far: yes, do it! But, only if you're sure you can handle the basics/tedium/etc. Popular physics is presented glamorously, but in *any* field, what goes on day to day is not like that. 

I'd like to share my story as well; it's similar to yours in some ways. I recently made the decision you're now pondering, and so far I'm doing well and am really happy.

Growing up, I was ""bad at math"". *Hated* it. I had another plan in life, involving something I was talented in, and I knew those ""You need math for every job!"" posters in classrooms weren't true in my case. I went through high school and college with this other plan, only to realize about a quarter of the way through college that I was *really* passionate about science. Specifically, physics. The way I'm writing it now sounds like some sudden, rash decision, but it wasn't like that at all. More of a love, latent since childhood, slowly coming into being. Science was something of a ""savior"" for me. Have you seen [**Science Saved my Soul**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB5QEgB3hCo) by Phil Hellenes? He describes it perfectly.

But, I couldn't afford to stay in school forever figuring things out. I graduated according to my original plan and into a semi-related, steady job. Holding down a full-time job teaches you to deal with tedium, bureaucracy, people, and all the crap that's part of almost any field you could go into. For a couple of years, I was extremely unhappy, occasionally verging on bouts of depression. I had no idea how to move on, how to get into physics, or how to afford going back to school if it came to that.

When something is *that* important to you, of course you'd want to dedicate your life to it, even despite the many costs, financial and otherwise. Only *you* know: will you be able to live without this? Or would it be a ""safe"" life, filled with constant questioning and regret? You only get one. *I* couldn't live without it. 

I also had some demoralizers to contend with, like your father. I remember a conversation with one former professor: I happened to mention my decision (*years* in the making) of going back to school and some of my anxieties about it. My mistake. This person proceeded to try to discourage me from doing this, only because he saw me through a certain lens that involved the skill-set I initially went to school for and what I excelled at in his class. 

A lot of people try to do this: if they see you're good at one thing, any deviation from that is confusing for them. We make cartoons of each other: if you're talented at Thing A, you can't possibly be equally good at some disparate Thing B. But, that isn't true at all. It's silly. You can't let other people dictate this. But you *must* also be honest with yourself about your resolve to do Thing B.

Long story shorter, eventually I figured out how to go back to school and pay for it (with Reddit's help, actually!). Now I'm back in, *enjoying* my first Calculus class. I recently got a great exam score and it boosted my confidence a bit. Some others here mentioned that once you do math daily, it becomes more natural to you — that's very true. For me, understanding that math is something really incredible that we can use to comprehend our world, changed my outlook toward it and has made me *want* to do it. Is it still hard and frustrating sometimes? Of course. I feel stupid A LOT. I'm on /r/learnmath all the time. But it's great. And I have to tell you, it's a lot easier now with the many FREE learning resources that exist at your fingertips. If you want, I'll post a list of some.

Anyway, maybe there's more or less I could've said, but please reach out if you have any questions. I'd like to try to help anybody who's considering this, but is anxious — whether that be to share learning materials, inspiration, books, financial info, etc.",1,2014-04-16 16:49:56
cgn5vyw,t1_cgn0eqz,,ampanmdagaba,t2_5qhy2,"On BBB and CCC: try to get them, or at least some glimpses, promises of them. Show that you can overcome your problems. Everybody have problems. Some people break their leg; some have to care about dying father; some are so poor that have to work 2 jobs for a year or two. What  you need to demonstrate is that your past issues aren't predictive of your performance in the future. That you at least overcame them; or maybe even became stronger because of them.

(For example, when you get to a grad school, you can use your depression experience to address the issue of diversity. You know, every now and then, when one applies for jobs, or funding, they are supposed to make a statement about diversity. Like ""why would you care"", what's your plan to increase diversity in academia. You'll always be able to say something like ""As a person with a history of temporary disability, I am deeply concerned about issues of diversity in my classroom"". You can turn your disadvantage to your advantage, eventually.)

And for addressing it openly: yes, you need to be rather transparent at this stage. When you are applying on paper, you don't need to provide too many details, and you need not to overburden. You need to only indicate that gaps are explainable, and that they are not likely to repeat. However if it comes to an interview, it's better to be transparent about your story. Be simple, laconic, and matter-of-fact about it. Think of how selection committees think. People hate surprises, so any issues like that should be addressed in an interview. Addressed, closed, and never brought up again, essentially.

(Or at least that's my take on it. Ask other people though; their opinions may differ.)",2,2014-04-08 14:30:16

You now are and anticipate no problems in the future.. Something along those lines in a much more elegant tone.

I struggled through all of my undergraduate career, and really began struggling with school when I was in 7h grade, and was able to sort of coast through high school but still do well. I didn't know what I wanted to do when I got into college, so i just majored in Biomedical sciences. It was interesting but didn't make me tick. Since I've graduated, I've started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist. Therapist and I came to the conclusion that I've had low grade depression for about a decade, along with anxiety issues and paranoid ideation. Psychiatrist came up with a Diagnosis of ADHD. Ive always had inexplicable, crushingly low self-esteem which given that depression and anxiety are often comorbid with ADHD ties it all together. To put it in a bit of perspective, the first time I ever thought of suicide I was 12 years old, ha, which I struggle to figure out why a 12 year old would have those sentiments. So despite having a label of intelligence, everything else kind of made that moot. I've now figured out what I want to do, though the damage is already done (3.02) GPA, and I'm aching trying to figure out how to go about accomplishing it. There were many things that I didn't know once attending college, and it always seemed like everyone around me already had all the answers.

ck9ud6y,t1_ck9tgna,,SustainedDissonance,t2_e050h,"In reply to your edit:

That may be true but I have had such ""late starts"" before and have ultimately failed each and every time and fell back into depression and other bad habits and behaviours. It's been somewhat a recurrent process in my life but that is never going to happen again and I should stop talking in *that way*, you *are* right. I've always had an image of my ideal self, yes and I'm trying to become that person as much as I possibly can but have struggled with such efforts in the past. That is the way it works, indeed! It feeds back into itself and allowing yourself to be even a little depressed will just cause you to spiral out of control. That's why I now have a routine and I'm keeping myself active and keeping my mind occupied etc. I can't let it happen ever again. Your crisis sounds familiar but mine has been ongoing for the best part of a decade. A late start, indeed! I suppose we will call those false starts. After all, even the most well-maintained engine doesn't start the first time every time. You *are* right and recently (as of mere months ago) I finally figured that out. That's why I'm focusing so much on writing; reading; composition and research as of late. I'm trying not to allow myself any time to feel sorry for myself. It is the only way.

The first time? The anxiety was the primary contributing factor. It's hard to focus on your studies when you're having attacks all of the time. I had to leave but that is better now. It took me *Years* but it is 99.9% under control now. The second time was a study-at-home course and after being rushed into signing up for the course and after perusing the material for some time... I realised that I already knew most of it (this was web design/development and I'd spent Years self-teaching before this). It was so very dumbed down in some ways and in others they were teaching things *wrong* (according to best practices of the time) and it just killed my motivation. The last time, I joined for all of the wrong reasons and I was very late to apply and so was again sort of rushed into it. My primary motivation for going was ""to meet new people and experience new things and to force myself into uncomfortable situations so that my anxiety doesn't ever become as bad as it used to be"". Indeed, I don't have any friends and since leaving that course I am once more near-completely isolated. But it was the *wrong* reason, even if I did enjoy the subject matter a fair bit. Indeed, that would be a massive ""fuck you"" to many people but this isn't about them it's about me. Truly, *those* people don't matter.

There's definitely no such thing as a clear pathway in life and so I don't see why that wouldn't apply to everything within life as well. I'm sorry about the research project and I can see why that would trigger thoughts along the lines of ""what is the point in all of this?"". But as you say, it's worth it all for the good moments and if you give up then there aren't going to be all that many good moments. You're right, I need to start... well I have started in a sense! I've spent a lot of my time the last week or so researching things relating to this. I plan to dedicate most of the week to it, I think. At least, *several* hours per day. I should set myself some kind of deadline - a ""you need to have it mostly figured out by this time"" kind of thing.",1,2014-09-05 12:55:25
ck9tsms,t1_ck9tgna,,SustainedDissonance,t2_e050h,"I finished High School with fairly good grades (enough to get into College) but I didn't stay on to do my A-levels. Funnily enough, back then I wasn't all that interested in learning and it wasn't until I left that this thirst for knowledge developed.

From what I can tell, it appears that I'd be able to study at University (without having to spend Years at College first) at least in some Countries (and I plan to study abroad, anyway). Whether that be by taking a few short and specialised ""College"" courses (which in some Countries (ones that structure their Education systems quite differently) last around 2-3 Months it would seem) and/or ""general aptitude"" exams which some places have and use.

I *was* and have been for most of my life but the depression (and everything else) is the best it's ever been. Yeah, I've been working on my routine as of late actually. For the first time in my life I actually *have* a routine and it is being improved as time goes by. I've had a lot of help from someone special and I've learnt (and continue to learn) how to help myself.

It is crippling but I'm done with being crippled and I've taken so many steps forward lately. This (studying) is perhaps quite the leap but as I said, I now have momentum.

As I touched on above the plan, if at all possible, was to spend the next year studying these shorter ""College"" courses (once I've decided 100% upon the Country and a field) and the hope was that by next September any prerequisites for a University-level course would be met. If not then I suppose that two Years wouldn't really hurt. If I stay here, though, it's possible that I'd have to spend far longer at College before I could move up (due to the shortest course being 1-2 Years as opposed to mere Months). And as I said, I am leaving the Country - new beginnings.

Especially how, as you say, things become more and more specialised as you rise and no one really *knows* where they're going to end up until they get there. And the journey is far more important than the destination anyway as I've started to realise. And that there are so many modules that you are able to undertake should you so desire, even from other departments, is a severe oversight on my part.

I'm not familiar with that poem but I will read it now as it sounds quite interesting.

ck9tgna,t1_ck9t52y,,Hanshen,t2_6r43k,"So hang on, what level of education are talking about? Have you get A-levels, graduated high school or equivalent yet? It's not a problem if you haven't, it just changes the advice slightly. 

To be honest, it sounds as if you're using depression as an excuse to not try anymore. You clearly care about your future, I mean you're on a website trying to find help for crying out loud! What you need to do is stop putting things off until tomorrow and find yourself a routine. I often find if I begin to falter I just force myself out of the house and go for a walk. Not necessarily a long walk but I walk for long enough for to formulate a plan of attack, to begin to break down what I need to do that day into small steps that I can tackle one at a time. 

Fear of failure is absolutely crippling, and sometimes being rejected time and time again can hurt, but the more you go through it the more you begin to realise that it really doesn't matter in the long run. As someone said a while back, 'what's the worst they can do? They can't take away your birthday for God's sake!' 

Also, what do you want to do with your college course? Is this something you then want to progress to university? At this level it doesn't even sound as if you have to specialise particularly! 

Lastly, stop using language that dwells upon perceived past failing! You are a late starter, that's not a problem and I know plenty of people who are both extremely accomplished and happy who turned to education/academia late on in their career. It sounds to me as if you had an image of who you would be that seems to have not quite come to fruition. Now, first off, this is common. I didn't see myself doing what I am doing now, but just because you've had a hiccup doesn't mean you should write yourself off. Giving up on yourself and hiding behind a veil of depression/anxiety will ironically probably only result in slipping further away from your goals and back into depression. The only reason I say this is because I went through a similar crisis that resulted in me dropping out of school when I was 16, I had a rough 2 years followed by a self inflicted kick up the arse that got me back on track. For me I signed up to work excruciatingly shorty hours for almost no pay in the agricultural sector in a foreign country, additionally there was a pretty exploitive contractual agreement in place that meant if you were fired prior to the end of the season you would pay for the rest of your board which was frankly extortionate. Anyway, the point is that when you don't have time to feel sorry for yourself, or allow yourself the time to procrastinate and overthink, things start falling into place. 

The real question shouldn't be which subject to study; to be honest if you loved all of them you could have literally done A-levels or higher diplomas in every single one of the ones you mentioned by now. What you should be asking is why the hell couldn't you stick it out in the first place, and what is different this time around? Your problem isn't being overwhelmed by choice, it's being overwhelmed by self loathing and an inability to move forward. Well let me be the first to tell you, the past is done, nobody cares how much you think you fucked up. What people do love is someone who has stumbled then got back to his/her feet and made a go of it this time. People love a success story, it doesn't matter what subject you study, the important thing is completing it. Imagine the feeling of graduating after all these years of depression! Imagine what an ultimate fuck you that would be to anyone who has doubted if you'd ever get back to college! 

Sadly I don't think there is a clear pathway in academia, or indeed life in general. There will be times when you are left wondering why the hell you are doing what you are doing. I've been doing research for a project then I have been working on for a year now, for example, and in the data collection phase I am beginning to realise that it isn't going to work out in the way that I wanted. When you get knock backs like that you do sometimes question why the hell you do it at all, but there are good moments too that you just have to keep striving for! The most important thing is just starting. The discipline doesn't matter, if you want to stay in academia there is time to tweak and change that as you progress to masters and PhD. Seriously though, if the feeling of failure you are getting from not ever finishing college is holding you back this much, then get off your arse and go to college to do anything.

I've spent the vast majorty of my life hating myself.

Okay, well I only have experience of College and not of University. So, it sounds as though it's far less rigid than College is? I haven't delved that deep with my research yet. I'm currently just trying to figure out what to study and *where*. All I know is that I need to do this for myself.

I think that the Natural Sciences probably are the best thing for me, afterall it is the phenomena of nature that fascinate me moreso than anything else.

It was brand new that Year and badly ran (I've been told this by several people who work *for* the College even!). A very low percentage (15%?) actually managed to make it through. Teachers kept leaving and new ones would be hired and it impeded *everyone's* progress and in the end I had to leave due to severe anxiety anyway. Similar (but no where near as bad) circumstances with the other courses.

You're right, I suppose. I'm just overcome with fear that I will pick ""the wrong thing"" again and we all have a fairly limited amount of time and I've already ""wasted"" ~1/4 of it. That no matter what I, or indeed anyone, choose(s)--that there will be aspects that are not desired--that *is* probably true and something I *do* need to learn to accept. I just always thought that if it was something that you truly loved then there wouldn't be a shred of doubt or uncertainty but that is unrealistic, I suppose. True, if I choose X then that doesn't mean I can't decide to undertake a career in Y. A healthy amount of bluntness and ""telling it like it is"" may well be what I needed.",1,2014-09-05 11:40:50
clwipsq,t1_clwcv85,,dapt,t2_3j4v4,"As noted elsewhere, alcoholism is more commonly judged harshly than other mental illnesses. Depression or anxiety would be a safer alternative, as most people believe they have experience with it (even if not really).",1,2014-11-08 09:27:31
clif87t,t3_2k67mu,,i_sideswipe,t2_8j08y,"I'm from the UK, so the exact way you go about this may differ from your own country.

You need to do two things, talk to your GP or primary care physician, and make an appointment with your universities student counselling service. I was in a similar position at the start of this year, with anxiety and small panic attacks. I couldn't face going into the office, or doing any work. In the end, the root cause turned out to be depression caused by some events that had happened significantly earlier in my life. 

Now this isn't true for everyone, but often anxiety can be a symptom of something deeper. When it is, and it's something like depression the actual illness can be so insidious that you don't even know your suffering from it.

The reason I suggest both your GP and the counselling service is that to properly treat this sort of thing really requires a two pronged attack. Your GP will be able to help you out with anti-depressants or anti-anxiety medication, then once these have ""kicked in"" the counselling will help you deal with the underlying issue. 

As for the rest of your issues, that is actually surprisingly common. It's known as [impostor syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). I was at a conference in my own fiend at the end of August, and had a really interesting couple of chats with senior academics about this. Even at their level, they get some of the feelings that you've described; that their work isn't original, that they'll get accused of plagiarism, or they've only got to where they are because of luck and deception.

You have dug yourself into a hole, and now you need to decide if you're going to continue digging deeper by continuing to lie.  You're also pulling others into this hole.  If there is ANY chance that your supervisors are ever going to publish/present this data with their names attached to it as co-authors, then you will hurt their careers.

clfjqe7,t1_clffyx9,,Ambivalent_Toaster,t2_dfypu,"I agree with the original commenter entirely, and would like to extend my sympathy for your situation. I have seen a good friend go through something very similar. 

In my view, you will find a future career in Academia very difficult, for two reasons:

1) Academic misconduct is, as you obviously understand, very serious. Academia is a tough career path even for people with perfect records, excellent research, and fantastic recommendations. Put another way, even those who have an absolutely squeaky clean reputation find it hard to make progress, and I can't imagine a scenario in which your misconduct would not severely hamper your career. 

2) This may sound harsh, but please believe me when I say that I mean it in the kindest possible way. I think that your experience shows that you are not cut out for academia, and that is absolutely fine. I'm not cut out to be a welder, a fashion designer, or a physician! Depression and personal problems are absolutely not a barrier to a career in academia, but the way you dealt with them is. By resorting to academic fraud,  you have shown that you don't have the temper required for an academic research career. You will in all likelihood have other bad episodes in your life, and if your instincts led you to deal with that by fraudulently misrepresenting research, I can't help but feel that this is how you will react in the future. Perhaps I am wrong, but I really think that you are better off seeking a different path.

Please note that this is just my opinion. I wish you all the best. ",8,2014-10-21 14:04:42

cla70y4,t3_2j6gfy,,ChesterChesterfield,t2_e6s7a,"Don't report your old crappy GPA. You're not hiding anything. There's no rule that says you need to tell them *everything* about yourself. An application is where you showcase the best side of yourself. It's not a biography. It's an application. You're trying to convince them to let you in their program. It's not a confession in front of a priest. Remember that time you got drunk and vomited on your friend's shoes? Remember when you lied to your mom about stealing the cookie? Does the graduate admission committee need to know that too?

Also, I think your recent 3.8 is more useful information anyway. They want your GPA because they want to see whether you're capable of handling the intellectual rigors of their program. A 3.8 shows that you're capable. And since it's also the GPA from your most recent time in school, it's a better predictor of near future performance. The 1.3 doesn't represent you. Why give them nonrepresentative information?

Still feel like you might be doing something shameful by hiding the low GPA? Get over it. You said that your low GPA was the result of an illness. Yes, depression is a medical illness. It is improper (in some cases even illegal) for people to penalize you on the basis of that illness. 

So... don't report it, because:

1) It's not appropriate
2) It's not relevant
3) It's not anything they should hold against you

OK?

I've served for over a decade on several different graduate admissions program committees. Undergraduate GPA is one of the worst predictors of grad school success. Too much variability from school to school, and the skills for success in grad school are very different from the skills for success as an undergraduate.

Edit: Don't believe the fear-mongering here. Report what the form asks you to report, and *only* what the form says you must report. If the form says list all schools attended, then list them. But that doesn't mean that you need to provide transcripts. No one is going to rescind your degree for following directions.

And once you're in, you're in. No one is going to remember your forms, or even care about them, because their job is done. Everyone is now going to base their opinion on how well you do in graduate school. 

I had a friend who faked a degree (not advising this, just saying) and went on to a successful CS career. I asked him once whether he was ever worried about that being found out. He said no, after he got his first job no one ever asked or cared about school. They only cared about his job performance. And his job performance was always great.

cl92c2b,t3_2j2gob,,i_sideswipe,t2_8j08y,"I'm a PhD student in Northern Ireland, we have two universities over here and I'm enrolled in the more ""prestigious"" and ""research centric"" one. What you described is fairly typical in my own experience.

I started my PhD back in February 2012, working on scheduling and optimization problems. While my supervisors and myself are part of a forty person research cluster, we are the only researchers there working on this type of problem. Although I had regular in-person and email contact with my supervisors, I was on my own when it came to day to day stuff. I had no-one to bounce programming problems off. This, coupled with some interdepartmental politics involving the head of the cluster rather pointedly not liking my research area, and that I was the only student under my supervisors led to some intense feelings of isolation.  

Things got pretty bad in my first year. My three month review was a shambles, and I think I was only saved by having a advanced abstracted submitted to a conference. Then over that summer I had a pretty serious health problem, resulting in my loosing about four months of work and having to miss my first conference (which turned out to be a good thing in some ways). The next six months after that were particularly hellish, as I had to re-create what I had lost as well as do the work I needed to prepare for my differentiation. 

Lets just say that by the time I had started my second year, I had some really large doubts over whether I wanted to continue. Somehow I did, I think more through pure stubbornness than anything else. While things did get a bit better for me for a while after I passed differentiation, including a rather nerve wracking first presentation at a conference, by Christmas 2013 I was extremely depressed. I couldn't bring myself to go into the office every day, surround myself with the colourless walls, and think my way through whatever problem I was encountering at the time. Things were particularly bad, and I felt a stronger than ever urge to quit. 

There are only two things that really saved me, and allowed me to get to the position I currently am in of writing up. In January of this year, my work environment was changed. Somehow my supervisors pulled some crazy strings, and got me and my equipment transferred down to their spin-out companies office. At this point, I was ""working"" alongside people who were actually working on real-world aspects of my research. This solved a number of the isolation problems, as I suddenly had people to bounce implementation ideas off, and could easily ask ""Hey, I can't get X to work. Do you know what Y means in this context?"". 

Later on, towards the middle of April/early May, things got bad again. The feelings of wanting to quit returned, along with some ""fun"" new things like anxiety and panic attacks. After trying to battle through it, I went to my GP and the counselling service my university provides. Needless to say, I was diagnosed with depression, which turned out to be a lot older and deeper in cause than I had consciously thought. Once I started treatment for that, the next 6 months until now were a blur of ""light bulb"" moments of emotion, crazy productivity, and from what I've been told a really well received presentation at my second conference. 

Right now, I'm starting Chapter 4 of my thesis (the first of the work chapters), and although I'm stuck for words, this is ok and I'm pretty happy with where I am. I'm aiming to submit at the beginning of February 2015, when my funding runs out. 

I've had some interesting conversations with other students at my university over the past few months, both across research clusters and departments. One common thread is that, the university that we study at, is not a good place to conduct research. Even within larger clusters or groups, which have meetings similar to that of your Master's experience, the feelings of isolation and abandonment are commonplace. What is worse is that the management of the departments and the university do not appear to care. This year was the first time students from my research cluster were invited to the cluster away day. Many things were discussed that day, including the above, but also lack of sufficient training and communications. So far, the only thing that has been changed is that the email lists for the school were updated, and we now all get several ""spam"" like emails per day advertising something or other that is going on within the school that usually has no relevance.

I can put my own...""success"" down to two things. Firstly, moving away from the university to my supervisors company as a work place. And secondly getting treatment for the depression. The only reason I'm still there right now, is that I am so very close to the end. If I was still in my first year, as I think you are from reading your post, knowing what I know now I would quit in a heartbeat and move somewhere better.

Thinking long term, I know I will not stay in academia once I get my PhD. My past experiences at my current university, information from PhD students at other universities and institutions, plus a hell of a lot of playground politics from other scientists within my field, have just soured me completely. Hell, my own supervisors are wanting out of academia right now, where one is taking a two year sabbatical to focus on company management issues, and the other looks to be making similar plans. 

My advice to you is this. First, check if your supervisor has a spin-out company where you could move your work environment to. If he doesn't, and if you think you've got the temperament to stay in academia, find a better institution. Otherwise, just leave and do something that makes you happy. Life is too short to stay stuck in a job to just survive on. ",2,2014-10-14 11:31:30

cl7di9q,t3_2j0si9,,lion_one_eight,t2_cfbiz,"It's long, but I feel strongly about this kind of thing...

If you can accept that your life goals and perspective WILL NOT change as you grow, mature, and experience new things, then--and perhaps only in that case--the ""Failure is Not an Option"" philosophy applies.  On the other hand, if you believe that your life goals and perspective WILL change with time, then you need to accept ""failure"" (I put that in quotes because what some people define as failure is really not failure at all) as part of life.  Sometimes you need to go through difficult things to realize that what you thought you wanted when you started is not what you now want.  

So, story time...  I started in the Air Force in 2005.  When I started I wanted to move up in the ranks, become a squadron commander, a wing commander, and hopefully a general.  For five and a half years, I had a great career:  multiple deployments, I was highly ranked by my commander among my peers (the Air Force is big on ranking you against your peers), a Bronze Star, an Army Combat Action Badge, an Air Force Combat Action Medal, and multiple Army and Air Force Commendation and Achievement medals.  I may not have made my way up to general, but I believe that I would have been very successful.  After my last deployment, I came back ready to do great things... but after working 70 to 80 hours a week while deployed, I needed stability in my life.  I came back only to work 50 to 60 hours on a regular basis AND I was going to get deployed again in six months.  After a three or four months of this, I began to take stock of my life.  In the previous four years of my career, the longest I had lived in one spot was 10 months in Afghanistan.  In a technical sense, my job was not challenging and therefore, for me, uninteresting (Why did I get an engineering degree for this?).  I rarely had time for myself and for my wife, and my wife wanted to start a family.  With regard to my [future] family, considering the ""operations tempo"" and looking at my current and previous commanders, I could realistically expect to miss birthdays, holidays, school plays, soccer games, etc. because I would either be working or deployed.  Is this really the life I wanted for myself?
 
I didn't want to separate from the Air Force and I did everything I could to hold on to my original goal.  I tried to rededicate myself to the Air Force.  I got more involved in work.  I got more involved in volunteering.  I took college classes after work (you're highly encouraged to continue your education).  I also started exhibiting symptoms of low grade depression.  For everything I was doing, I couldn't get past the fact that this was no longer satisfying, that I'd seen and done so many things that my job didn't seem interesting or challenging anymore, and that my life goals and perspective were completely different than when I started.  

I grew up in a military family... it was all I'd known my entire life.  When I started, I equated separating from the Air Force as failure.  When I got out, I equated staying in as a failure to my current goals.  The bottom line is that life is beautiful and complex, and that we can't predict where we'll be or what we want.  We can only start with the best intentions and continue to move forward. 

I saw this quote on Facebook; it's a bit cheesy and may be somewhat of a platitude, but I like it none the less:  ""Judge your success by what you had to give up to get there.""  So what will you have to give up to be ""successful""?  Are those sacrifices worth it?    

I got out of the Air Force after almost seven years and I'm in a doctoral program at a great school for engineering.  Things aren't completely rosy; my adviser is a miserable/""successful"" dickhead, but I'm generally happy.  He has made me question whether or not to switch advisers or leave the program.  One thing I do know, however, is that this one person, no matter who he might be, will not be a driver for me to change my goals--that will only come from me.  Finally, to explain why life goals and perspective might change... well, that's a whole 'nother wall of text for some other day.

Indeed after learning that you suffer from severe depression I am hesitant to write this, however, understand the following. You WILL NOT find direction from this outreach. 
1. How can you expect anyone to tell you what field to go into? You slammed your options and shared that you now are disillusioned with the area you chose. 
2. You say that you are unemployable because you have not had a job. This is not true. You are simply sharing that you do not wish to work below your percieved station, and I do not know why this should elicit sympathy (blunt I know).
3. Why do you wish to discontinue your PhD? You say that for all your life you wanted to be a research scientist. So give it a shot.
4. So you don't know what you want to do with your life? Boohoo. You could literally work in any simple 9-5 job while you figure your life out. Work in retail, work in a call centre, work in a supermarket, work in a media agency, work in a bar for God's sake. Because the one thing I will share with you is that if you keep busy and meet new people you will learn about many new options you haven't considered, you might even decide you wish to return to your studies after some time away.
5. Finishing your PhD will not hurt you in the long run. The only way it could is if you decided that you did not ever for the rest of your life want to have anything to do with what you wrote your thesis on, I don't see that happening. Even if you're 20 years down the track you may wake up and want to pick up where you left off.
6. (Closing point) This quater life crisis isn't anything unique. The only this unique about it is that it is happening to you in particular. Just do something, get a job while you think about things, you might go through 5 jobs and hate them all. You'll still learn more about what you want. Hell, go traveling if you need a new experience and meet some new people. Just do SOMETHING and stop thinking that 9-5s such as call centers are beneath you (they might be but you don't yet know this) because while you wallow (yes that's all this is) about 20 options you could persue in your mind and systematically debunk all of them before you start and waste time achieving nothing you will start to fall behind. 

Just get a part time job at a bar (yes they will hire you), meet people and ask them about how they started doing what they do as you might find it interesting, take a break from studying if you wish (just defer for now) but for the love of god keep busy. Stimulate your self and stop moaning that decisions you made now bore you and then do nothing to fix your own predicament. Set some small goals and achieve them, finish what you start. You are an adult. Don't ask strangers (albeit nice strangers) who don't know you to recommend what you should do with your life that's irresponsible as hell. 

Just take a deep breath. Smile. Know you're not alone with your crisis. Set some small goals. Get a job, and the story that is your life will unfold as you want it to. Small steps.

Oh boy is this accurate.  Grad school will surely exacerbate mental illness as it's largely self guided and requires a TON of internal motivation.

There's really nothing wrong with leaving graduate school and pursuing other options. Not everyone needs a phd or ma. 
In addition getting the degree may not help you and you may lose the opportunity so it would be a waste of time to continue. 

However it is not something to decide based on depression. And to be honest that's how it sounds, though I'm no expert. It is so common in grad school to be clinically depressed especially at the point where you are now. So it's better to get some help and push through than to make a decision you might regret later.

coglr70,t3_2v7y9z,,sparklecrunch,t2_l9n9s,"There is so much good advice here. Depression is a really diverse illness and what works for one person doesn't work for everyone else. I went through a sever depression during the first year as a new faculty at my University. You know right when I ""achieved it all"". It was a very challenging experience and I experienced a great deal of shame about the situation. Like many of the other commenters my depression warped my perception to make me believe that my entire identity depended on the success or failure of this new career while simultaneously bombarding me with abuse that told me I did not deserve my new degree or was not good enough and that it was only a matter of time before I failed and the reason that everything was going poorly was my fault. 

For me coming to terms and accepting that I was mentally ill was really really hard but it was also the most important step to recovering. 

Ultimately, I recovered though using many different resources.
1. Asking for help, owning this illness and sharing my experience with friends and family
2. Hospitalization during the most sever crisis
3. Medication. I still take an anti-depressant and when it finally started working about 3 weeks things gradually became manageable again.
4. A 2 month leave from work. (At the time I was mortified when my doctors insisted that I take a medial leave. I hadn't even been at my job for a year yet, I was teaching and it was mid-semester however, looking back I am so glad I did this I helped my recovery immensely)
5. Staying with family while I was on leave so that I would have someone who could plan my day while I was on leave and so that I would not be alone all day.
6. CBT therapy (I was introduced to this in the hospital and continued with therapy for a few months). This was really useful for me and helped me identify when my mind was basically warping my interpretation of events and feeding anxiety which in turn was feeding my depression
7. Weekly Group Mindfulness for Anxiety and Depression. Discovering that I was not alone having a group environment to safely talk about common experiences with Depression was probably more useful than one-on-one therapy for me.
8. Regular exercise and 15 min daily meditation. I have struggles a lot with insomnia and meditation has been very effective an preventing this.
9. LOTS and LOTS of time. Like any sever illness or injury healing is a slow process. It was over a year before the trauma of the depression began to subside. When I was in the middle of the depression I felt as though I would never be ""me"" again this in the end was another symptom of the illness. Nothing lasts for ever, not even pain and not even depression.

cofttk7,t3_2v7y9z,,skcll,t2_4gnfy,"Try to build a support network there.  It's never too late to reach out to your classmates and people working in the department.

I'm in a similar boat.  Not exactly depression, but anxiety and periods of low activity and motivation.

I've been looking into psychotherapy solutions.  I've come upon three general types.  Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT: this type of therapy tries to alter your logic/reasoning and thought patterns, basically trying alter that inner critic in your head), mindfulness based cognitive behavioral therapy  (MCBT: very similar except that it seems to draw from the buddhist practice of mindfulness and mindfulness based activities like meditation and yoga which are designed to make that inner critic voice shut up and stay focused on the present moment and awareness of your surroundings in the present moment), and psychotherapy that focuses on past experiences as causes of current behavior (past is prologue?).  I figure this last type is better for the folks who've dealt with some major trauma and that trauma is the cause of their present behavior.  

So the medicine should try to correct for any hormonal deficiencies and genetic causes for your state of mind.  But I figure psychotherapy can be an additional efficient tool.  But you should probably go at the basic minimum once a week.   Twice or three times is probably better.  For the CBT and MCBT methods, you want your therapist to almost be your coach and you want to practice these methods.  Joining a yoga class and a meditation class and talking to the other students after and making friends could provide an opportunity for you to make friends. 

So one CBT method I've found useful is the practice of forgiving myself.  Did I wake up late?  Did I procrastinate?  Instead of hating on myself, I now try to remember that I can't change anything because it's in the past, that I need forgive myself to be effective and tell my self-loathing voice to shut up, you're not helping.  I can tell from experience that the self-loathing isn't keeping me from oversleeping or procrastinating in the past (in fact, it probably increased my anxiety and sense of hopelessness and contributed to both).  And I can't change the past, so it really is useless self-defeating thinking.

That's generally how CBT works I think.  I tend to have a bias toward the CBT methods since they can begin to work rather quickly and are effective generally as long as the basis of your behavior isn't too deeply based.  I think it could probably help with motivation too.

Anyways, Yoga (especially) and meditation are amazing for stress.  Reward yourself perhaps weekly or biweekly if you can afford it with a nice massage as well.  Anything to reduce your stress.  It's weird, but stress causes your muscles to tense up.  What yoga and massages do is untense those muscles.  And this has the odd effect or reducing your stress and anxiety.

You mentioned shyness.  I  have my own brand of shyness and my own brand of the productivity problems you have, but I've found that trying to alter my inner dialogue and belief systems has been the most effective.

I have a fellow PhD for whom the shyness was much more deeply embedded.  He found Xanax and more of the deeper psychodynamic psychotherapy (focusing on the past the person's life) was effective and though familar with CBT thought it wouldn't have helped him.  So try to systematically work through your options, and find what works for you.  You mentioned somewhere else that you had done computer based CBT.  That doesn't make much sense to me.  Can you expound on what you did?

Also, when I've talked to fellow graduate students, I've realized they're dealing with similar type shit.  I'm not too far off, but instead one of my main deficiencies is more in how I present and handle myself.  So I'd actually consider group therapy even if you don't want to talk to your fellow students.  You'll realize you're not exactly all alone.

Then try to add good diet and sleep, therapy, exercise, etc. and gradually you will get back to your full capacity.  However, there is a possibility that your advisor might not be able to accommodate your present situation. My suggestion is to first consult with a student advocate or consular and see what your options are before talking to your advisor. But you definitely want to use your advisor as your ally instead of your adversary, and the only way to do that is to be as honest with her as possible. In the worst case scenario you would need to take some time off to recover.

Meantime you need to re-evaluate your current career and life style and make sure it is really what you would like to do (if you didn't have depression). Is your possible lack of satisfaction with your career a part of the problem?!

cofemse,t3_2v7y9z,,Still_not_there,t2_dr9x1,"I've been depressed earlier in my life. Thankfully not during my PhD. I do however still have a lot of anxiety issues that I'm working on every day. My biggest realization, the one that got me out of my depression, was that **I should ask for help**, even if I think that *This is a task I should be able to do without help*. Suddenly, every time I was struggling with something, I could ask family or friends or teachers or even my boss for help and they would give it to me. It's like a super power. And no, it's not like I'm abusing my family and friends. What I'm saying is that I've realized that everyone that are happy in life give and take help from others when in need.


What kind of help do you want? I'm sure you and your psychiatrist has talked about strategies to get you out of your depression, but they are not working? You can always change medication and psychiatrist. Try finding a psychiatrist that has a better understanding of the country you're from. Different cultures requires different approaches to therapies.


I take it your family and friends support net are at a minimum from your post? Family on the other side of the planet, and no social life?

When you're depressed it is very easy to isolate yourself and that makes it even harder to recover. If you don't want to talk about problems you will still benefit from just being around people, even if the only thing you talk about is the weather.

If by ""downer"" you mean a person that constantly whines and complains and is negative about everything, then yes you're right that's not very likable. But that's not the equivalent of a depressed person sharing. That's equivalent of an ass. Look at this this way, if someone asks you ""how are you? you dont look 100%?"" then it's perfectly fine to say ""not so good today"". It is actually a good thing to share your life with others, because that gives them the incentive to share with you and a bond is created.


How's your daily rituals? Do you have a fixed routine you do every morning? This is an incredibly powerful way to establish a sense of purpose in life. Every day, set the alarm for the same time, and when it rings go up, brush your teeth, eat breakfast, and get dressed - even if it is Sunday and you're not doing anything the whole day. Take a walk in the park/forest/nature every Wednesday. Find some book circle club and meet every Saturday for coffee. Wear the blue socks every Thursday. Every evening do yoga in front of the tonight show. It doesn't matter, as long as you make it a habit.


If you want to get out of this depression you will have to find, and employ, a strategy that works for you. Whenever you think ""I will never X"" or ""I can't X"", stop that thought and replace it with ""I have not X, yet."" or ""I can't X, yet"".

You must change either the way you behave, or the way you think, or both, to change the way you feel. They are all connected. I know it is hard and I know that my words might not be the words that you can hear, or want to hear, or even is the words you should hear, but I know how it is to struggle with life and have no one to talk to. I want you to make it. Hang in there",6,2015-02-08 23:13:25
cofdz4w,t3_2v7y9z,,FreudsNipSlip,t2_8c0fv,"I've been in the exact same position as you for the past few years, except I've been working on a masters instead of phd.  Reading your post was like reading something I had written. I tried therapy, prescriptions, everything... but I still kept getting further behind and my supervisor's patience was wearing thin and I felt like I was letting everyone down with no ""real excuse"" as to why I wasn't doing what I needed to do. 

My doctor had been urging me to take some time off to recover ever since I first started seeing her, but I was determined to not be a ""failure"" and kept pushing on. But in November I had a huge breakdown, ODed on sleeping pills and realised that I had two options, get healthy, or continue downhill. I talked to advisors at the university and arranged to take a year break. Some days I still beat myself up about it, but I know that things will still be there for me when I come back, and this was honestly the only way I could get better. A huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I can now devote my energy to getting healthy so that when I do go back, I can be proud of my work and know that I am giving 100%. Sometimes you need to realise that your personal health trumps everything. 

I'm not sure what your university's policies are, but it's worth having a talk to someone about options of taking a break for medical reasons. If you had just had a heart attack, people would expect you to get better before coming back to work. Depression is a real medical condition that needs treatment and time to heal. 

I would also consider seeing another therapist, as others have said, just to see if there is another approach that could work for you. 

That is just my two cents and my experience, I really hope you are able to find something that works for you. Just don't be too hard on yourself, and do what you need to do to get heathy so you can enjoy your life again. Just know that you are not alone, and people are often more understanding than you might expect if you are honest about what your are going through.

cofczv1,t3_2v7y9z,,oreamnos,,"Yes to therapy, group therapy, and so on. Keep that up. Don't act based on depression, it doesn't have your best interest in mind.

But also - and I know this is controversial - seriously re-think what it means to be doing what you're doing, and why you're doing it. Don't be afraid to quit. Quitting is not only stopping something, it's always starting something new. Do you really want to be doing this? Is there something that would make you happier, is there a life you're not living that you would rather be living?

Don't hang onto something because you think it's all you have. You have the world. If you are a person who got yourself into a PhD program, everything and anything is possible. Would you rather backpack around the world, doing odd jobs? Would you rather start a business baking cookies? Would you rather work an office job? Would you rather be with family, closer to friends, or in a different city? Would you rather be studying something else, making art, doing manual labour? Chopping wood, working in a forest?

There is wisdom in recognizing what you really want to be doing and pursuing it - even and especially if that means quitting something that isn't working for you. Don't quit because you're depressed, depression is common for students. But if you deal with your depression you need to then ask yourself why ""acting like nothing is wrong"" has become your default behaviour, and why you're doing a PhD to begin with.

Have you talked to a counselor, not just someone who prescribes meds?  For me, the meds gave me the energy but the counseling was what really got me back on track.

If you are in a deeper depression than you've been in before, you will have to work harder (and for longer) than before to get back out.  There's nothing wrong with you, as a person; it's just how biology works in these situations.  Nerves/neurons take a while to heal. 

Talk to your university's Student Health Center.  A LOT of academics have depression.  You might be surprised at the resources they have on hand for you. 

Just don't stop fighting; you can do this.  You will figure out a good treatment eventually.  And then you will work on it hard for a time and eventually come out the other side again as ""yourself"".

&gt; some parts of it should certainly be doable, and I'm even failing at those. 

i know this thought all too well. You really should try [Cognitive Therapy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_therapy). I hate that word – therapy – but it is just a word that means a regimented meditation. Take a look at the book and it should make sense what I mean. 

CT or CBT (Cog. Behavioral Therapy) is very regimented and self-regulated in a way that equips and prepares you for autonomous decisions and actions.  I think that was lacking in my PhD program. My advisors - like many advisors - left me to my own devices because that's just the way things have always been. As a professor now, I share CT techniques with my students frequently as preventive measures, and not remedial or therapeutic after the ""crisis"" arises.

&gt;To be honest, I also feel pretty ashamed about basically not being able to do anything despite there being no (visible) obstacles

This is exactly what everyone says who has ever endured states of depression. In most cases, it is just that: a state, and not a condition or long term syndrome. CT provides a framework for determining if you need more than CT, which is cool. 

&gt;so I really don't want to talk about it in a group

You can overcome this. Everyone in such a group is saying the exact same thing and that's what grad school support groups are for. My ""Group"" just started up among friends because one guy said ""hey, you should read Feeling Good"". We are scattered across the globe today, and we still have a very close relationship.

Psychiatric help is a great kick-off at the beginning of the half (sorry, still have superbowl on my mind), but you can self-regulate (not self-medicate). If you are in a PhD program, you are bright and disciplined enough to self-regulate your thoughts.

I think ""Feeling Good"" should be required reading for every PhD student during the first year of studies. It is Cognitive Therapy approach to resolve issues of anxiety, depression, anger...basically all the psychosomatic conditions that result from cognitive acts to emotional acts. By tracking my thoughts, I discovered it was I who was creating my own emotions that left me paralyzed with anxiety and perfectionism.

The attrition rate for PhD programs is 50% on average. PhD earning power and career pathways are also pretty striated. A lot of people get stuck in the dregs of adjunct teaching or post-doc hell making less than 30k yearly and with student debt to repay. Hang out on /r/gradschool and /r/askacademia for a couple of months and you'll really quickly get a better understanding of how these types of careers work. The reason people are skeptical about your motivations is because people generally are very jaded about proclamations of how much you love your topic. No one would be in academia if they didn't love what they studied and there are still tons of people posting on these subs everyday talking about horrible depression and fantasizing about quitting. 

People will take your interest more seriously if you have direct experience to back it up. Volunteering/working in a lab is pretty much the best way to start. I would hold off on applying until you get experience bc people with no experience usually get their application tossed without a second look. Secondly, even experience is not enough. You need to prove to the admissions committee that you had work you were independently in control of and you'll need good rec letters and and a statement of purpose to do that. Never make insinuate that in your lab you spent most of your time doing what other people told you to do. Getting through to the admissions committee is proving you can be a grad student and you do that by proving to them that you understand the science and context of your research and you can make your own decisions about your research. Lastly, I would recommend enrolling in some graduate level immunology/micro/phys/etc courses and studying your ass off for them and getting good grades. This will prove that you can handle the classes at grad school despite your formerly bad GPA.

edit: PS. The type of cynicism that /u/acidfast7 is trying to warn you about, while it's pretty common, isn't the entire picture. Lots of different schools have different cultures. I went to a pretty big undergrad so it was pretty varied for me. I had a very understanding and nurturing PI who was very into taking risks on undergrads. She took one on me and I became a far better research because of it. But our collaborator lab for example was a very freaky and walk-on-eggshells environment and I would expressly avoid the other PI bc he had a reputation for making all his female researchers cry.

cfbkngo,t3_1xi0vg,,lk09nni,t2_6pz7s,"Hi! All of us were once sophomores in high school, too. I was one of those kids who totally hated (and still hate) chemical equation balancing, math, biology... well, almost all of the high-school curriculum. People told me I was ""smart"" and that I could do this, but I had absolutely no desire to, and I felt dumber and dumber the more I failed. I finished high school with moderate grades in the natural sciences, but excelling in art and the humanities. 

I love drawing and poetry and dreamt of going to art school. My middle-class, hard working academic parents assured me that I'd be dirt poor the rest of my life if I did. 

I rebelled by choosing creative writing and philosophy majors for undergrad, paying for it all myself through different nursing jobs at the hospital. Everything went rather slowly and I took several gap years. I went on exchanges to Europe, Asia, South America. I volunteered in Africa and the Middle East, hoping I'd find inspiration for an upcoming book or something. I hung out with unknown musicians in basement clubs in Berlin and showered in waterfalls in Cambodia. My life was great! I thought. 

And then I was hit by major depression. Why did that happen? Why was I so terribly depressed when I was finally doing things I loved? All the travels, the amazing cities and all the art felt meaningless to me. 

I started talking to a psychologist and found that feeling the pressure to succeed made me start hating things I used to love. I was suffocated by the need to be one of the few very best, especially knowing that I was on my way out in a murderous job market. On a whim, I started a course in chemistry - knowing how much I hated it in high-school, but thinking that I needed to get my mind on something else, and suddenly everything fell into place. I somehow got into med school (""they appreciated applicants with diverse undergraduate schooling""). I found structure where I had none, and surprisingly - now that I don't feel the need to do it professionally, I love writing and drawing again. 

I get through this because I know it is my choice. I know I have the possibility to do something else, but I choose this. My mind loves to think about things and keeping it busy with something structured makes me feel sane. I love being surrounded by smart and ambitious people. I still hate balancing formulas and calculating dilutions, but I'm glad I got myself through that stuff in high school, so that I understand the basics and can find the right app to do the calculations for me (he he). 

If I were to give you any advice, it would be to do your best and finish high school, without putting too much pressure on yourself with getting good grades and all. Keep working with music, but even if you work in the music industry, remember that you might find yourself in a position where you might want that course in advanced economics and, fuck, well you need to be able to count. Or you might realize you want to ge into sound engineering, or something. 

You never know where life will take you. I fell in love with one of those musicians in the Berlin basement. He had dropped out of high-school to work with music full time, but was getting disillusioned with the superficial music industry. He went back into an adult learning program, got his high-school diploma and at 30, he is finishing a masters.

I'm going to be honest, succeeding in college will require self-motivation and dedication. If you don't have that in spades, you're almost guaranteed to fail or get an incomplete education. 

If you're not doing it already, then I implore you to see a psychologist so that you can start taking control of your depression and anxiety. Once that happens, then I'm sure you can do well in college and find a career (perhaps in academia) that will allow you to engage in writing. :)",2,2014-01-18 06:28:51

I too suffer from depression and have a bad case of social anxiety, but after 4 years of going to school on and off (switched schools and majors twice) I've finally gotten off my ass and am now pursuing education to become a firefighter. A lot of the shit I'm involved in is about being vocal and working with others, neither of which are my strong suits. 

Trust me, if *my* dumbass can get it together I have faith in others. One thing that has helped me is remembering that **no one** and **nothing** can stop you besides yourself. Fuck being scared to fail, because if you don't pursue what you want to do, you already have failed. Just my 2 cents though. Good luck

ces69eb,t3_1vgi83,,thekingofpsychos,t2_anfd3,"After I graduated high school, I attended a very large and competitive university and was in the Honors program. What sets Honors students apart from ""normal"" students was that we enjoyed a large variety of benefits:

1. Instead of having to live in a freshman dorm, I got to live in an unofficial ""honors"" dorm. It was one of the best dorms to be in because its strategic location (smack dab in the middle of campus), and because people behaved themselves.
2. There were special ""college success seminars"" exclusively for honors students.
3. We had our own set of academic advisors inside the ""Honors College"".
4. Special opportunities for extracurriculars such as conducting research.
5. Students can take ""honors classes"", which were usually special versions of a general ed class that were only for honors students. For example, instead of having to take a huge English 1102 class, I was able to take a multicultural lit class that had only 15 students. That was awesome.
6. Finally, there's always just the prestige of being an Honors student. Your CV/resume will automatically look more impressive than that of a ""normal"" student.

Being in an Honors program is a very special privilege and an opportunity to obtain an education far beyond the typical student. Unfortunately, I suffered from depression and ended up dropping out after only a year so I squandered that chance.",-2,2014-01-17 20:48:50

cein2yu,t3_1uifrl,,cyberonic,t2_66cb3,"Please don't take my comments the wrong way if they might seem harsh. I will comment while I go through.

**FIRST PARAGRAPH**
&gt;When I enrolled as a community college student, I told myself I would only transfer to a university if I fell in love with a career path that required a university education. 

I don't understand what you mean. Did you fall in love with said career path? If yes, phrase it that way, leave out the ""if"".

&gt;As a student without financial support from my family, I knew that I would have to work to put myself through college, and that I would rely on the generosity of government grants, scholarships, and student loans to finance my education. I knew from the start that it would be a waste of all financial assistance I received, as well as my own time, if I did not have a good reason for attending university.

You keep talking about bad things like ""waste of time"" and I am still not certain where this is going especially because the paragraph ends here. Did you have a good reason for attending? What is it? Say it!

**SECOND PARAGRAPH**
&gt;I concluded a desire to spend my time in something I truly enjoy, for I do not see lasting fulfillment coming from working for the sole reward of money. I asked myself, if I didn't have to ""make a living,"" what would I do each day? My answer was immediate: I would learn everything I could about the subjects that interest me and share my findings with others. I realized I want to be a college professor. 

Finally, the reason. This is actually quite nicely put. I would delete the first paragraph.

&gt;But what would I study? I was interested in psychology at the time, but as I continued to study the discipline, I became absorbed by the brain itself. During my time at XXXX, I have continued to narrow my interest to neuroscience of medical issues. 

Give us an insight into WHY you were interested in XYZ, why the interest changed. Provide examples.

&gt;By studying the brain, I can play a meaningful role in society by helping people who suffer where science's understanding rests incomplete. After considerable research and discussion with my mentors, I changed my major to biology. 

Ok. I noticed that you didn't write what you initially studied. Put it in somewhere.

&gt; I believed this would best prepare me to enter a neuroscience PhD program directly after my undergraduate degree. I determined that a strong foundation in the sciences that elucidate neuroscience, such as biology, chemistry, and physics, is paramount.

good, you might want to change weak phraseslike ""believed"" to strong phrases like ""am certain""

THIRD
&gt;At the core of my decision to major in biology is the perspective that my coursework is a purposeful training for my future as a researcher, which will enable me to someday make significant contributions to my field. Much of my coursework has already done this. 

the last sentenced sounds oddly phrased

&gt; Biology of the Cell and Fundamentals of General Chemistry provided the foundation for my further education in both of these core disciplines. In General Psychology, I began to see the brain as the source from which our experience as human beings arises. In Biological Psychology, I was introduced to some of the underlying biological mechanisms of the brain. This class inspired me, sparking my curiosity in the brain. 

example, good! but how did it inspire you?

&gt; In Experimental Psychology, I was introduced to the world of experiment and research. College Statistics provided an essential foundation in statistical analysis, an essential tool for any researcher. Similarly, I my enjoyment and success in English Composition classes will help me as a researcher. After all, it is through writing -- and ultimately publication -- that professors reach the widest audience.

What are English Composition classes? Might just be me, though. Anyway, leave out the dashes.

&gt;My future coursework will continue to prepare me for research. Biology courses, including Neurobiology, Biology of Organisms, Biology of Populations, Cell Physiology, Molecular Biology, and Genetics, will provide the information necessary for understanding the brain in the context of the biological organism it drives. 

You should not list all of your courses. Just give a general idea about what you did. Do you have methodological courses, neuroscience courses, etc

&gt;Further, I believe I require a strong understanding of chemistry, as biology is the sum of chemical interactions. Therefore I will take a year of General Chemistry and Organic Chemistry, as well as a course in Biochemistry. 

""One year of basic chemistry courses will provide an essential basis for my holistic education in cell physiology based on its chemical interactions.""

&gt;This same logic gives rise to my interest in physics coursework. The laws of physics lead to those of chemistry and biology, and thus a year of Physics will prove important.

I would rather argue that physics knowledge is important to understand imaging techniques like fMRI.

&gt;The other component of my training as a future scientist is research. Thus far, I have participated in a summer research program at XXXXX, during which I worked full-time in XXXX's lab, studying the neurobiology of mice selectively bred for voluntary high wheel-running. I developed a project under the supervision of a graduate student who was underway sectioning and analyzing brain regions. I became curious about the mechanisms that contribute to the mice's ability to run three-fold more than control mice. I examined the periaqueductal gray, a midbrain landscape implicated in the mediation of both ascending and descending nociceptive pathways. Given the relationship between exercise and pain, I wondered if the mice had structural differences in brain regions involved in pain. Previous research showed the mice possessed larger midbrains, so I determined this area warranted closer inspection. My project required employing a Nissl-staining protocol to identify the nuclei of the tissue. Using microscopy, I captured photographs of the sections. With the guide of a brain atlas, I delineated the periaqueductal gray using software. We then analyzed for differences in neuronal density and area. I wrote a paper on the project, as well as presented a poster at XXXX's student symposium. Over winter break, I have continued to volunteer in this lab.

This is basically good. The summary of your topic could be shorter. You can then expand on methodology. Like what software did you use for the density thing? This is important. What happened to the paper? Is it published? In any case, state the current status.

&gt;If accepted to XXXX, I would like to work with one of the following professors: Dr. X, who studies synapses and neurotransmitters; Dr. X, who investigates the neurobiology of depression; or Dr. C, who examines the effects of drugs on the brain. Of course, given the integrative nature of neuroscience, the opportunity to work in any relevant lab would prove useful to a developing neuroscientist.

You tend to just list things. What is way more important is the WHY. Why do you want to work with X?

&gt;I feel that XXXXX would provide an invaluable opportunity to me as an aspiring college professor and researcher. I recently resigned from my part-time job, so that I can continue to be involved in research during my time as an undergraduate. If I am accepted, the opportunity would provide me the financial means to continue working on research, along with other resources, such as faculty mentoring, which I will need to be successful in my goal of acceptance into a neuroscience PhD program directly after my bachelor's degree.

No. The first sentence is an empty phrase. The only specific reason you state for wanting to join the program is money. That is a huge no-no.

Dude, these are the two most important parts of the essay. First, wrap up why you WANT to join the program, then wrap up why they should take YOU and not some other guy.

&gt;I realize there are many applicants to this program, but in your decision, I hope you will consider me. This opportunity will help me accomplish what I want to do with my life.

""Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to your favorable reply.""

In total, the main content parts where you explain what you did should always be targeted at the question why they should take you. What aspects of your education did other applicants not have? What makes you special?
You sometimes write a tad to sloppy. Try to make it more elegant, but not too formal.

It feels like what I imagine postpartum depression feels like.

I have a TT-job at a U.S. R1 doing the research I wanted to do and teaching the courses I wanted to teach. But with so many Ph.D. holders out there I feel like tenure is the new Ph.D. So now I'm chasing tenure. This isn't always a great feeling, but it is *something to aim for*, which (IMO) is what goes missing after you finish your Ph.D. It's purpose that drives us and gives our lives meaning, and the interstitial moments between achieving one goal (Ph.D.) and starting on the next (tenure, starting a family, rebuilding a sense of self-worth after realizing you wasted 5-7 years of your life) can be unstable times.

cdombjc,t3_1rm3j8,,Deightine,t2_611an,"Also important to question whether or not you see the ""public face"" of the happy folks you've talked to, or if your contacts have all been from the same university cultural environment. I've noticed a lot of complaining comes from the most vocal marginalized professors, abused grad students, and those who feel free to say what they really think due to internet anonymity. Take that away and they smile at the department parties, eat crap politely, volunteer for bureaucracy-laden committees, etc, and fume inside.

To reference your last question... Competition doesn't breed pessimism; perceiving competition as futile breeds pessimism, as each perception compounds until a general opinion forms, then after its reinforced enough, you tend to lean in that direction all of the time. Frustration is what drives a person to that. Much like repressed anger may drive you to depression, so can repressed frustration. Pessimism is a very effective way to write-off things that frustrate you, as a coping mechanism for a situation in which you have no perceived power.

In academia, a lot of that power is taken away from the participants. Want to do some research? Where is the money coming from? Have to appease the university or a grant approval committee. Want to change your curriculum? Do you have tenure? Even if you do, you'll still need to get the approval of your peers unless the changes are minor, lest professors disagree on topics and students ask whom is right, etc. It's a pretty bureaucratic place and positions are scarce, while tenure seems to grow scarcer by the day.

Grain of salt: I'm a post-undergrad pre-grad, but I've spent a lot of time around the bureaucratic crap that happens in university departments. Humanities departments being some of the worst, too, as everyone wants to be nice, tries to be nice, but secretly wants to pull off someone else's head in every meeting they are forced to attend.",17,2013-11-28 01:46:35

cd7vfog,t3_1q08yb,,hootener,t2_9ctr9,"I was going to applaud you for picking up the slack, and tell you to gut it out and finish the semester since things seemed to be working out for you...

Then you dropped that ''Side note"" bomb. That's not a side note, friend, that's an ENORMOUS red flag. Based just on the evidence you've offered, my knee-jerk reaction is to drop the teaching and see if the department can do something to put a post-doc, multiple lecturers, or something in that course to fill the void between now and finals.

I also agree with /u/sighing_sage, I think the department is much more worried that they dropped the ball and aghast that they had a second year student picking up all that slack without them knowing about it. Also, second speaking with the adviser at the first chance. Perhaps there's more going on with her secrecy than meets the eye...then again, maybe she was just new and didn't know how to go about asking for help. In any case, clear the air in that respect. 

If your adviser runs into trouble as a result of her actions, that is not your issue to feel guilty about, she chose to tap you rather than inform the department of her issues. This choice may have been based in misunderstanding, or the fact that ''well NotAnInstructor seems to be humming along just fine so I'll just keep asking him/her to cover me."" Whatever the reasoning behind her choice, she made it, not you, so don't feel guilty.

This degree of responsibility should NOT fall on you, and I'm sure your adviser would be outright ashamed that she even asked you to cover so much if she knew the full toll the work was taking on you.

Grad school is hard, and being placed into a situation where you need to drop/withdraw from courses isn't doing you any favors. If you're uncomfortable alerting the powers that be to the full extent of your anxiety/depression/stress issues, that is your choice, but step away from the teaching. By the sound of it, it's doing a number on you.

Taking such responsibilities would do a number on just about any second year graduate student. I cannot fathom taking on what amounts to essentially a full teaching load on top of coursework and research, it's a recipe for severe burnout and can't be helping your stress and anxiety issues. Don't feel guilty for not being able to perform like a rock star while shouldering a superhuman workload. You tried your best, and succeeded to a greater degree than many others probably would have.

It ended up with me withdrawing from 3 semesters of classes in a row.

Add to that my less than optimal GRE math score... I got in the 85th percentile in verbal, and 96 in writing, but my math is &lt;50 percentile, due to me not studying. I just figured I could roll the dice on the GRE and my scores suffered for it. I honestly kind of threw in the towel for PhD programs. It was my dream to apply to one, but now I'd have to prep for the math GRE and take it in a month, and send out all my applications.
