7wihb6,MsFrizzle94,,Just Earned PhD in Cognitive Psychology &amp; It Wasn't Worth It,"I received my PhD in Cognitive Psychology in August 2017 from an R1 university (I'm not going to identify the university right now).  To get straight to the point:  It wasn't worth it.  Not even close.  If I could go back in time and turn down the offer, I would.

But I can't, so here's the reality:  I currently have a one year position as Assistant Professor of Psychology at a small liberal arts college.  My initial starting salary offer was $51,291.59.  After two months of tense and frustrating negotiations, the university made a second offer, so my salary for the 2017-2018 academic year is $56,549.17.
I bring home $1,523.58 biweekly after taxes.  After paying rent, electricity, internet, cell phone bill, groceries, and student loan payments, I have very little money left over at the end of the month. Additionally, I have no job security-- I am constantly applying for (and being rejected from) faculty positions for the upcoming 2018-2019 academic year.

I have astronomically high student loan debt.  I will be making payments for the rest of my life.  There are very few faculty positions open for cognitive psychologists and when those positions do open up, the search committees receive tons of applications.  One of the positions I recently applied for had 58 applicants.

Additionally-- if you are currently a PhD student and think that earning your PhD is the light at the end of the tunnel, you are wrong.  You will continually be forced to prove your worth over and over again.  You'll need to prove your worth for job applications, for tenure track positions, for raises and promotions.  

I have a bachelors degree in psychology, two master's degrees, a PhD, and an advanced graduate certificate.  I have publications.  I have years of research experience.  But I feel like none of that matters.  I'm back at square one again.

The four years I spent earning my bachelors degree and the two years I spent earning my first masters degree were very enjoyable.  Those were the six years that made me fall in love with psychology...with science as a whole.  With academia.  

The five years I spent in my PhD program (where I earned my second master's degree and my advanced graduate certificate) were the worst five years of my entire life.  I worked day and night...60-80+ hours each week.  My stipend from being a TA wasn't enough to live off of.  The department knew that; it was common knowledge that most of the grad students were struggling to put food on the table...but no one with any power cared enough to do anything about it.  

My PhD advisor was abusive.  She expected me to work non-stop, to be available any time she needed to meet with me...evenings, weekends, holiday ""breaks.""  She constantly put me down.  It wasn't constructive criticism.  It was abuse.  Minor, often inconsequential errors resulted in a barrage of criticism-- I wasn't good enough, I would ""never make it"" in academia, I don't have ""a scientific mind.""  She would criticize me for planning to go home for the holidays to visit my family and if I went anyway, she would flood me with emails asking when I was coming back to work.  She was constantly pushing me to work harder, to work faster, to be more productive...design more experiments, run more participants, analyze data faster, know every single detail of the results, etc.  Memorize the means, the standard deviations, know every single inferential statistic.  Write it all up.  Perfectly.  Drafts would be returned to me with pages and pages and pages of edits and she would sigh and shake her head in exasperation if a new draft with all of the feedback incorporated wasn't returned to her within the next day or two.  I barely slept, I barely ate.  I always had a million things hanging over my head.  There was no relief, not for a second.  I ended up in the hospital for 5 days from exhaustion and was then put on anti-anxiety medicine.  But it didn't stop.  It actually got worse, because on top of the criticisms, she would add that I was ""overly sensitive.""

Long story short-- I made it through.  I graduated.  But now what?  Few job opportunities, low pay...I feel like I have no control over my life.  If I want a good job, I need to be willing to go wherever someone is willing to hire me.  There's little to no chance of being able to stay close to my family and friends.  

I'm frustrated and angry.  My mental health has been destroyed.  My confidence is completely gone.  I have more student loan debt than I can ever possibly pay off.  

I wish this doctorate came with a money back guarantee.  I would have returned it a long time ago if it meant that I could get my life back.  If I could follow a different path where I would make more money, have better options, more control, more job security.  I've invested so much time, money, effort...I've sacrificed more than I can describe.  I feel like I'm completely stuck and it is devastating.

bnkkhh,gradschoolabuse,t2_23jv8dzt,Academia has given me chronic mental health problems,"I am a postdoc who escaped a 'lab' with a notoriously toxic mentor. I survived 8 years with that person, it was the biggest regret in my life. The person is a classic toxic narcissist, and I am now recovering in a new lab. The new lab is far far more functional, and I have that to thank for not killing myself. 

Suffice to say, the last PI pulled such shit and ended quitting to become promoted elsewhere, I was blackmailed and had to switch advisor 6 months before defending -- Despite knowing them for 8 years. I was so so happy to get out, but now my name is totally tarnished in academia. Old PI has slandered my name as much as possible. I am honestly feeling pretty bad in the new postdoc, I see a therapist but I feel old PI got their nails under my skin permanently, like a sick mental possession. The emails I still receive are totally disturbing to say the least, and I complained to my old university up until the point I graduated. Now I am gone and moved 5000 miles away, so I do not talk about it anymore. I try not to talk about the situation with new lab, I have dropped hints to new labmates about the creepy shit I went thru and they say it's complete bulllshit I hopefully will never have to experience again.

I am hoping that understanding the day to day workload of someone undertaking a major research project like a pHD can help me plan out my own routine when I take on my thesis next year.

cyuo99,usedhandles,t2_3fg9by85,Labour Day thread on precarious labour in post-secondary education:,"Polemically put: post secondary educational facilities thrive on precarious labour. 

Some of this impacts our graduate students (as teaching assistants, research assistants, and people training to get a job one day), adjuncts, VAPs, non-ladder faculty, and postdocs. This precarity can then increase the workload of everyone higher above them (more letters of reference to write, more job applications to read, more work to supervise \[if they do it\]). 

Precarious labour in the academy has been suggested to impact the [quality of teaching](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Conditions-Imposed-on/125573) (caveat: this article sparked a lot of controversy), [the production of hostile work environments](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2019/02/14/how-bias-toward-adjuncts-plays-out-among-students-other-faculty-and-administrators), and mental health crises (CW: [suicide](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/04/adjunct-professors-higher-education-thea-hunter/586168/)).

Precarious work extends far beyond the academic staff of a university found in the invisible labour that keep these institutions afloat: [food staff](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/11/huds-strike-retrospective/), janitorial staff, and part-time administrators. 

The consequences of precarious work extend far beyond the quality of life issues associated with economic and job security  ([example 1](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2019/08/hefty-university-fees-are-sending-some-grad-students-food-banks), [example 2](https://tenureshewrote.wordpress.com/2014/01/16/succeeding-in-graduate-school-despite-poverty/), [example 3](http://neatoday.org/2017/11/01/homeless-professor/), [example 4](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/28/adjunct-professors-homeless-sex-work-academia-poverty), [example 5](https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/april-may-june-2019/how-college-professors-turned-into-uber-drivers/)) as well as issues of health insurance and retirement plans (for those not working in social welfare states). Included, but in no way limited to the plethora of sexual harassment cases (CW: discussions of sexual harassment and sexual assault): [example 1](https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/04/penn-sexual-harassment-in-academia-graduate-students-panel), [example 2](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/07/how-women-are-harassed-out-of-science/492521/), [example 3](https://medium.com/@UAW5810President/short-term-appointments-make-uc-postdocs-vulnerable-to-sexual-harassment-ccaeed532512), and [example 4](https://entropymag.org/a-refuge-for-jae-in-doe-fugues-in-the-key-of-english-major/).

cwrpuc,doctorungrateful,t2_4gyq3d0d,Was just awarded an early career grant... but have been actively trying to LEAVE. What are my options?? H A L P.,"So... just got the notification my project was selected for funding. 2 years, ~100k for direct costs + some salary support.

I'm on my second year of my first postdoc (genetics), where it's been hinted I'd be moved up to a research asst. professor. 

I know the normal emotion should be excitement and celebration but:

I recently decided, accepted, and mourned that I wanted to GTFO out of academia or at the very least change labs ASAP.

Currently working in what is imo a sinking ship of a lab. To be brief I'm struggling to stay engaged in the work. We're also down to a skeleton crew and the social isolation is really having a big negative effect on my mental health.

So now when I read the application I sent out in the spring got funded, all I feel is trapped.

Im guessing my options are:

1) Stop bitching and just grind it out. True, the project is cutting edge and will be a huge CV boost even for industry work. However, I don't think I can stomach another two years at this lab.

2) Start reaching out to lab heads at other institutions ASAP to see if they could offer me a position. The grant is transferable, but it starts Jan 2020 so I need to hustle. Im assuming bringing some of my own funding with me will make this easier -- am I overlooking something? 

3) Continue applying to industry positions in the meantime and accept any attractive offer as it arises. I see the major risk here as major bridge burning, pissing off the funding agency, and being generally kinda shitty. Is turning down an award even a thing? I don't this grant allows it to transfer to another PI.

You guys have any experience/insights? 

I know with how tight pay lines are this sounds ungrateful but god the timing was just so bad.

ps, my PIs know I have been considering leaving academia. They don't know about the award yet.",86,2019-08-28 22:10:14

bvemx1,inthelabxo,t2_3v9n6kga,"I am student in a lab, another student is constantly asking me for help and I don't know how I should deal with it","I am currently one of a small number of students in a lab doing a research project. Our projects are independent but are very similar with a lot of overlap between them. We are quite a close group and therefore often arrange to go into the lab at similar times and we all help each other out e.g. if someone is going to get reagents they will get enough for all of us, etc. However, there is one student in the group who is constantly asking me for help. I did not mind at first but I have now become this person's default person to ask for help. However the help is not the occasional question such as asking for my general opinion or checking their working out for a calculation but constant questions about nitty gritty details of their experiment to the point where they want me to basically outline what they should do that day.

&amp;#x200B;

To put it kindly, and I know I may get flamed for saying this, this student is clueless. They have very poor English which means they cannot follow what is being discussed in lab meetings with our supervisor and they cannot comprehend what our supervisor wants us to do. They do not seem to understand much, from the general overarching theory behind the projects, to how to perform calculations (which are the same calculations we have been using for weeks now), to how to use a computer (let alone the complex software we need to use to analyze our results). I know this sounds horrible and unkind and I know they cannot help having a language barrier but I am burnt out from all of the extra help I have been giving them. For example, I spend time explaining how to get data off of the computer software and put it onto a USB drive, something that is simple to do, and I mean I really broke it down into baby steps which they wrote down, this week they still had me show them three more times and then when I was out of the lab they asked our other lab mate to save the files to their USB for them... It is just so hopeless. I spend three hours showing them how to use the software which we had been taught a couple of days before by our supervisor but because the supervisor speaks too quickly for them to understand so once again I really broke it down, but the questions they ask just show me that they have no comprehension or understanding of the software or the reasons why we are doing certain steps. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am at the point where I need to step back for the sake of my mental health and academic integrity. I know that without my help they would be completely lost but I am at the point where I do not care, they are not earning their degree this way. They do not deserve the degree. However, it is all well me saying that I do not want to help them anymore but they are quite manipulating. We are both, obviously, adults but this student is significantly older than me and I find it hard to say no to them. When they ask me questions I try and deflect and say they should ask our supervisor for help and they say ""no I want to ask you as you are good at this"" or some variation of that. They always want to come in the lab the same time as me so the past few days I have been purposely misleading them saying vague things like ""I might come in the morning"" and then not showing up until noon. However, I did this the other day and they sat at the lab bench from 9am to 11:30am waiting for me. Two and a half hours they sat there and did no work, just waiting for me because they had no clue what they were supposed to be doing. Even at the weekend and evenings they are messaging me and phoning me with questions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our supervisor knows this student struggles with their English and they struggle academically, they know I help this student a lot and am patient with them. I don't feel like I can go to an academic and basically say to her ""hey your student is not fit to be in the lab"". It is just not my place. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would really appreciate any advice or suggestions you have on this situation. It is a difficult situation. I know on the surface it seems like I am moaning about helping a fellow student out but it is the magnitude of the amount of help they require and the lack of efficacy of the hours of explaining and extra help I am giving them is having which is the problem.",72,2019-05-31 23:52:41
ax1r1e,HumanDrinkingTea,t2_o4xhq,Is there a bias against students who use accommodations?,"In particular, I'm referring to students who appear outwardly ""normal."" In your experience, do professors question the legitimacy of these accommodations, even if they don't do so in an outward or public manner?

I'm a *very* strong student (I've received the highest grade in the class in all but one class that I've taken), but I am a bit older and it's my second go at college. The first time around, it was a disaster with health issues, which consist of both neurological and mental health problems. I managed to get through with a slightly above average GPA, but on close inspection of my transcript, it is obvious that something was up. My grades were almost entirely A's and F's, with nothing in between. 

Now it's a few years later and I'm in the midst of a career change. I now have a 4.0 in a challenging STEM field. My first semester back was a bit rough, but I pulled through. Since then, I've been doing much better. However, past experience has taught me that if I don't have accommodations in place, I am at serious risk of failing if something unexpected happens to my health. As a result, I am sure to get an accommodation letter and hand a copy to each of my professors at the beginning of the semester. 

I have gotten mixed reactions from professors, several of whom I greatly respect. One told me that I use accommodations as a ""crutch,"" with the implication that I don't need them. Another said outright that she thinks I don't need them. And she's right-- much of the time I don't. But sometimes I do, and I feel having them in place is a means of disaster prevention. However, I get the sense that professors may think that my choice to use accommodations reflects negatively on me. 

My question to those of you in academia is whether or not I should be worried that I will be taken less seriously because I have made use of accommodations. Is bias against individuals with ""invisible"" disabilities widespread? Or is it just a few professors who don't ""get"" it? If I am doing well, should I consider trying to go without? The sting of failing several semesters of undergrad still feels fresh, even though it was years ago now. Most people can't imagine that I've ever failed anything, but the risk of going without a safety net seems too high. Perhaps my professor's right and I am using it as a crutch?

I feel conflicted. On the one hand, I feel that maybe I don't deserve the accommodations I'm given or don't need them. On the other hand, I see it as necessary to prevent the disaster that happened several years ago. 

Can we have an honest conversation about accommodations in academia and how we feel about them? ",65,2019-03-04 02:24:11
576c4r,studentwasting,t2_122ois,"A good student is visibly wasting away, and I don't know what, if anything, I can do to help?","I am a young research professor, only in my third year at this University, and teaching my first class - up until now, I've been involved with research and research only. 

There's a student in my class who I am very concerned about. In the 2 months I have been teaching this class, she has dropped a lot of weight, going from a slim healthy looking girl to a stick with a head, literally. I mean, I look at her and I think her neck is about to snap under the weight of her head. The class is multiple times a week, and *every* class she just looks sicker and sicker. Sunken eyes, extremely slow movements. I finally decided to ask this question when I saw her nearly faint when getting up.

It's shocking. I have no knowledge of eating disorders, but this seems like the epitome of anorexia. It's a bloody shame too, she seemed like a very bright and engaged student to start with, now she hardly even looks up during class. 

I am not in america or in any of the more... evolved western countries, and unfortunately, there really is not much focus on student mental health or even a guide on scopes of faculty-student interactions, basically as long as we stand in front of class and teach them something, and as long as the students show up, the leadership is happy with it. 

This student is from abroad, and more than likely doesn't see her family more than once or twice a year, and I haven't really seen her with any friends, so I think if I don't do anything, no one will. Honestly I'm scared she might die, and there could have been something I could have done about it. 

What can I, as faculty, do to help her?",62,2016-10-12 20:31:10
7ga1yh,amalgamationoffer,,"I was sexually assaulted by one of my professors, and am still trying to recover from the fallout from that to get back on track to a PhD. Appreciative of any advice.","Hey all, I'm in a bit of a conundrum. Couldn't tell you how grateful I would be for anyone to offer me advice.

As a kid, I had trauma in neurological health, and it became hardened into my identity that I would make sure I became a great researcher when I grew up. However, at the start of undergrad, I got hired to be a research assistant for a neuroscience lab by the head of the department (who was also my academic advisor), but I got sexually assaulted by one of my other professors in the same week. The best week of my life quickly became the worst week of my life. I couldn’t quite choke up the words to explain to my advisor what happened, and he just took my ensuing poor performance in the lab as evidence I shouldn’t go into research. It took me until my senior year working with counselors to heal from my PTSD. I still managed to get respectable grades in college, but I didn’t make close relationships throughout college. After graduating, I moved back home for financial reasons caused by my history of medical expenses.

Still driven to become a researcher, the nearest lab in my field was 3 hours away, and so I made the 6 hour total commute to/from the science lab many times every week. It never bothered me because I loved volunteering as a research assistant there so much. I felt on track in preparing myself for a PhD, everything seemed great for 3 months.

Suddenly, domestic abuse starts happening in my house between other relatives, what the actual hell. It soon became a very stressful environment, and it not only revived the issues with my mental health in college, but it revived the neurological issues I had when I was younger. Slippery slope started. I developed an addiction to cope with it all. The 6 hour commutes became harder, I couldn't be reliable anymore, and my service at the lab was discontinued by my supervisor. To try and get out of my home environment, a friend's father offered me a job so I could pay rent somewhere else and get out, but after a few months of even weaker performance, I was fired. And then, months of me doing nothing followed, just seeing doctors to heal myself. I was so suicidal, mostly because I felt my dreams to get a PhD in any reasonable amount of time were crushed, and it was all largely out of my control.

Home is better now, but it's been a year and a half since my graduation, and I've little to show for it. Didn't do an honors project or anything during college, didn't make many close relationships, but overall grades seemed similar to the average admitted PhD student, so I just needed research experience and people in the field to get to know me for letters of recommendation for the PhD. I'd been looking at schools like Northwestern and UC-Irvine due to the people who match my interests there, but now I feel very small and that my chances of getting into great schools like those have really been hurt. With how hard I try and recover from these setbacks to achieve my lifelong dream, there is no way I am letting myself settle for a school that is not excellent for my career, and I just don't know how to get back on track to get there.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but since I’m probably as healed as I’ll get now, I'm thinking that the best option for me now is to get a part-time or full-time research assistant position somewhere near the city (Chicago), move there to cut down on the commute, and on the weekends see if I can volunteer at another lab or the one I'd been volunteering at previously again. I’ve lost a lot of time out of the field already, and I certainly can’t afford to lose any more, right? 

However, they may ask for previous employment, letters of recommendation, and ask what I've been up to since graduation. There’s incredible competition out there! I don't know what to say without shooting myself in the foot. I want to seem hirable and make sure I do get hired. 

Additionally, without having an advisor that believes in my aspirations as a researcher, remaining in the dark about the consequences of my setbacks has been REALLY stressful. Like, I have no idea if the loss of these 1.5 years makes me now need 5-10+ years to prove myself or something like that. As anyone who has ever had PTSD can tell you, much comfort is brought in knowing what reality to expect or accept, even if it’s not a reality you wanted to accept. And if you’re the kind of above-and-beyond nice person out there who would be happy to take a look at my resume/academic details and give me specific advice on what else would really give me an advantage in getting into a great PhD program, that’d be awesome too. Just any help at all in this would be great.

I’m extremely grateful for any time you might offer me. Can’t say that enough. Thanks.",62,2017-11-29 03:11:42
b04j6s,this_fell_sergeant,t2_vzkoj,"I'm interested in an academic career in the Humanities (lit or philosophy), but also terrified by the bleak job market. How should I prepare myself?","I'm currently applying to undergrad degree programmes (I have some offers from universities, but not all, yet) and my dream job is being a researcher/lecturer at a university. Unfortunately I've read and heard many terrifying stories about the bleak academic job market for the humanities and how even if you're willing to go to the remotest part of the globe to secure a job, you might not even get one, or you might end up jumping from one adjunct position to another without securing a tenure-track job.

Additionally, I've also heard that getting a PhD in the humanities and failing to get into academia will leave you stranded because you're nearly thirty without any working experience and essentially you'll be jobless and broke.

As I'm not from a rich family, and not particularly confident of my ability to marry a rich person (lol) the future sounds bleak and terrifying. At the same time I don't know if there's anything more important to me than ideas and books--I feel more at home and alive doing coursework than anything else--I'm the kind of person that gets obsessed and will work compulsively, and I also have emotional and mental health issues that make me doubt my ability to find happiness elsewhere. And all of this makes me think my only chance of finding fulfillment is pursuing an academic career.

So I'm not sure what I should do. Should I just go for it? Or find something else to do? Are there people here who've left academia and found fulfilling jobs elsewhere? Any advice would be really appreciated!

b4aehf,boomer_the_landcloud,t2_2k3nuewf,PhD advisor ending my career before it begins,"Hi Reddit,

I am posting here because I feel helpless and completely crushed. I would like any advice at all. 

To give you a background : I defended my PhD thesis in May 2018 and since then have been working on a paper for publication without any pay or health insurance. I finally found a job that let me start on Feb 4th. A day before I was supposed to start I was told I couldn't because my advisor had not signed off on a form which is the last step to get my degree. 

After a lot of anguish and calls and emails, he said I would need a week or two more to work on the paper. After revisions are submitted and this comes around, he says it still needs more work. He then talks to my future employer and we all agree to a month more of work on the paper. That month of work ends today. He is now pushing this back further by a week, has ignored my several calls and emails literally begging him to sign on the form but he will not respond back.

The dean's office and department are involved but I am not losing another week of significant pay and having chronic health conditions not having health insurance again is another week of mental anguish. I am not sure how someone is supposed to be in the right mental state to be productive when they are treated so poorly and pushed into a corner. 

I don't want this to happen to anyone else again. Should I send an email to all the other students to warn them? What should I do about this? Any help would be appreciated. ",51,2019-03-22 21:01:26
1nu922,stressednhappy,t2_dem3h,My advisor is trying to steal my work,"I am a PhD student who worked with my (now ex) advisor for 2 years. During my time working as her graduate student, I realized the impact a bad advisor can have on a person's mental and physical health. 

Along with constant berating, I came to realize she was only interested in publishing papers, and not ethical research. Without going into boring details, the last straw was when I fell sick. I was not allowed to come into work (since we work in a lab with 15 other people and no ventilation) as I could be infectious, and she cut my salary because I could not perform up to par during my illness. I am a graduate student, and we live mostly paycheck to paycheck. 

That is when I decided to switch advisors. Which I hoped to be a smooth transition, but turned very ugly. My ex advisor contacted me relentlessly , promised me a pay raise, no work hours, vacation time, called my parents, my girlfriend, my friend in another state to urge them to convince me. And finally sent a threatening email to my new advisor. Since we are in the same department, we decided to not make it a big deal. Picking fights with a professor is not healthy.

But now, she has started bothering me again. She wants me to help her publish papers which were my ideas and work (I have proof of concept and work) or else she will push me out of the paper and publish it on her own. I truly believe she does not have a fair and ethical attitude and I do not want to cause trouble for me or my new advisor. 

Is it worth picking a fight over this? 

I apologize for the lengthy post. But as a takeaway, a bad advisor is like a bad relationship. It can be traumatic and detrimental. I hope not many have to face this issue.",50,2013-10-06 13:07:42

Is there something that draws the line between someone who studies at Oxford and someone who studies at an institution that's not at the top of rankings? I'm talking only about the people, because I'm aware a big difference can be resources. 

Alternatively, what is it that makes certain academics do groundbreaking work (especially in the humanities) that other academics don't have?

7n7uxr,Astro_Biscuit,,Does the pace of academic life change after PhD?,"Context: I'm a final year PhD student in the UK, so I've been working on one topic for ~3.5 years and now I'm in the last month of writing it all up into my thesis.

Problem: at several points throughout my phd and particularly in the last few months I've struggled with my mental health. I'm incredibly stressed, I used to be really passionate and excited about my work but now I dread every day in the office and procrastinate hugely. This has spilled over into my personal life so I have no energy or motivation for socialising, cleaning, personal care etc. And I think I have figured out the root of this - IM SO BORED!

I love school and university because I was always learning new things and being set new challenges. I actually enjoyed exams an trying to hit my target grade. But now in research the targets are so nebulous, there are no defined grades or rewards, and every success (paper, conference presentation, getting a code working) feels like an anticlimax. I worry that I'm not suited to academia because I need a more varied job, with shorter time scales. Working on one paper for more than about 9 months I just get to bored of that subject and the results seem so incremental.

Question: does the pace pick up in Postdoc jobs? Would that be a more varied role? I know the specifics will be different for each discipline (I'm in astronomy) but if you contrast PhD and early career researcher, how would you say it is different?",47,2017-12-31 10:25:44
9covvo,MrKarmaChameleon,t2_o5d1p,Measuring up. Where to go from here? Grandfather with PhD from Stanford. I've got an Associates from community college and 12 dollars in my bank account.,"My grandfather is a Mexican-American and he overcame many hardships. He started at community college and pressed forward, earning 2 masters degrees and finally a PhD from Stanford in '84 in Cultural Anthropology. He worked as an Applied Educational Anthropologist, working toward growth in migrant and bilingual education. He did this while raising a family without any outside help. 

He had 3 children and 7 grandchildren and education is his passion.  None of his children pursued higher educations, and of the 3 grandchildren who did, I'm the most formally educated. I'm 29 years old and all I've got is an associates degree. At a relatively young age I promised him that he'd see me walk with a bachelors degree. I've got maybe five years to live up to this commitment. 

&amp;#x200B;

His struggles were very different from mine and probably much more difficult. My struggles are mostly financial, bipolar I disorder and that I'm gay and transgender. 

My major is currently Anthropology and I was going try to follow his footsteps. I've realized over time that I'm better equipped to pursue something like gender discrimination or mental health care, when it comes to social injustice. 

&amp;#x200B;

My interests are in history, philosophy, anthropology, culture, education, psychology and sociology. It's really hard for me to keep focused on one specific area. I'm a lover of all things ephemeral and my whole life I've seemed incapable of routine and structure. Any suggestions how I can get beyond this? 

I can't find a job that will financially support me enough to pay my bills and go to school at the same time, even with loans. Working and going to school makes growth very slow, and on financial aid, I need about 20 hrs of work weekly to survive, meaning if I shoot for my best, I'm capable of a cap of 3 courses per semester. But sometimes my bipolar disorder makes all of this very difficult.

av0sjd,brandoldperson,t2_30i7v0sm,How to contact professor after ghosting?,"At the end of my Masters degree 7 months ago, my supervisor was very impressed with my thesis. He said there was a chance I could get it published and so I agreed to keep working on it (for free) back in my home country.

After about 2 months however, I stopped working on it and sending any updates. This was due to a few reasons:
1. As I worked on it more, the less novel I found my work to have been and results got less conclusive.
2. I had some mental health and family issues.
3. Financial pressures made me have to get a job quicker (I had initially budgeted some time to work on this)

I am not proud of how I dealt with this however. I just ghosted an email from him asking about my progress. Then, I got locked out of my university account (expired) which can only be unlocked by going to tech support in person (I am no longer in the country).

Now, I would like to get in touch with him. I am embarrassed by my conduct despite the reasons for it. My reasons for wanting to get in touch with him are not entirely selfish:
1. I would like to have the chance to thank him for the fantastic experience I had working under him
2. I would like to apologize for my conduct
3. I would like to give him an update regarding my career (which is in the field of his &amp; my research!
4. I would like to rebuild the relationship and have him as a referee/reference for the future. (I am NOT seeking a reference in the immediate future)

Now that I'm serious about building a career, I want to learn as much as possible about what a potential job in academic research would be like, and how I would achieve that.

Long story short, I graduated with a BA in Linguistics. Loved every subject and got a 4.0, but virtually nothing else to show for it: no *relevant* research or meaningful networking, and no clue what I was doing with my degree. Ignorance and mental health meant I didn't take my time in college to steer that degree towards a career.

Now that I'm in a place where I'm actually able to think about a career, I'm asking the questions I should have asked before going to college in the first place. Are there any jobs in it, and who gets those jobs? What is the career path like? What areas of research should I look into? Can I make a living this way?

by0cwv,StefanIstas89,t2_fao5taj,A toxic academic environment. Is it normal?,"At the moment I am doing my PhD at a UK University, and am in the middle of my second year of studies.

So far, I believe I have a satisfactory progress (related to the technical aspect of my project) in programming.

Despite my overall satisfactory technical and research progress so far, I still face several hinders on progressing with my Phd at the Institution I am at the moment.

Without having to shift the blame to anyone, I feel I am struggling with my current supervisor and this has created an uncertain environment for my graduation. Although, I believe I am a very hard working person, working more than 8hours per day including weekends and this can be seen by my portfolio and all the applications I have developed so far. None of them were quite easy to be developed and it requires a lot of skills and experience.

Still my supervisor is never happy. He continuously providing me with harsh criticism to almost everything I do. Even the simplest words I use through my academic writing to describe my work and they are common sense to me but for my supervisor isn’t. I keep continuously receiving feedback and comments for my academic writing and suggestions to correct things that I cannot even imaging that they are wrong or inappropriate, as I have encountered similar academic writing to so many papers that I have read so far.

Under this harsh criticism, I haven’t been able to publish a paper yet, not because I am not working on this, but because of the continuously feedback I receive that “It’s not ready yet” by my supervisors. Maybe, it also has to do, because in part, English is not my first language.

I tried to switch supervisor internally and the new supervisor had a different mindset for my project than my principle supervisor, demanding certain terminologies to be changed, while when I shifted back to my principle supervisor, again, I had to change the terminologies based on my main supervisor’s mindset.

Additionally, my supervisor changes his mind very frequently. Among meetings, he may suggest one way of how things should proceed and at the next meeting, he may change his mind and diverge the progress trajectory. This instability has made my life miserable.

I don’t know if all the academic environments are like this, but I sense that there is an uncertainty of whether I will end up having a PhD or just waste my years in that department.

The only thing for sure is my developed algorithms and applications. Everything else, is continuously changing. Even my aims and objectives I had to revise them, I don’t know how many times until they were accepted.

Under this uncertainty and rigorous criticism, my progress has been on halt, coping with anxiety and mental health issues.

I don’t believe a PhD should be so difficult. The only difficulty in a research project should be the content and the learning procedure and apply it to meet the objectives. Everything else, like writing papers, creating portfolios, presentations for conferences and etc should be more free and not have to cope mentally or argue with my supervisor to decide how I should do those things.

Does anyone have similar experiences? Is this a typical PhD life? Should I try to change University?",41,2019-06-07 21:53:00
7seuc6,snewmy,,"Tips for dealing with the final semester of PhD? Job search, dissertation writing/defense (wedding planning too, ugh)?","Hi r/askacademia! 

First of all, thank you for any advice/wisdom/words of encouragement. I'm in the final home stretch of my PhD and a couple years ago I wouldn't believe my good luck at being where I am (I almost considered quitting after coursework was over and couldn't decide on a topic). I'm still fairly excited about my dissertation topic, I'm getting skype interviews left and right and I have an in-person interview with my ""dream school"" on Friday for a TT assistant professor gig. I'd be teaching undergraduates, which is pretty much the most fun thing I've ever done. I love it.  I have a good plan for a postdoc if these don't come through. Oh, and I've found an incredibly supportive fiance whom I love like no one I've loved before. He's even made a color-coded calendar to help me stay on track with dissertation writing. From the outside, it's all going roses and sunshine. 

Yet, I feel like I'm sort of cracking up inside. I've struggled with an anxiety disorder for my entire adult life (and probably had some childhood stuff too). For the most part, I've been pretty good at balancing all of the self-care, taking time, medication, exercise, eating well, therapy, meditation, all of that jazz throughout the PhD. I've doubled down on all of it now. But last night stress-induced insomnia hit again and I'm pretty terrified I'm going to go down the path of constant panic attacks. I'm about a third of a way through my dissertation and I honestly can't imagine sustaining this level of stress for the next couple of months. Much less the actual defense compounded with the uncertainty of what comes next. Most of me knows that this is just a stressful time for anyone, but I still feel like a bit of failure and that it's my mental health diagnosis kicking in again. 

Academics of reddit, what did you do to cope with this period? Especially those who have stuggled with this stuff before? I love my field, and I feel fortunate to be excited about the future (except when I'm feeling a massive impending sense of doom). Thanks so much. ",40,2018-01-23 14:45:53

4yrtyk,throwaway-sh-phd,t2_10qvvo,Should I hide my self-harm scars until rotations are over? (bio PhD),"Hello. I was looking for advice, preferably from someone in a STEM field who is a professor or has a lot of experience in the environment. 

I'm starting a PhD program in less than two weeks. We are going to do rotations in labs for about 1.5 months per lab.

I have very visible scarring on my forearms and wrists from self harm and a suicide attempt. All the visible ones are not new, but not old (faded pink, all the deeper ones are over a year old). They're impossible to miss, and they're too deep and extensive to cover with makeup or bracelets. 

On the one hand, I don't want to hurt my chances of getting into the lab of my choice, and if most PIs would have significant reservations based on the scars, I'll suck it up and wear long sleeves every day for the next 6-8 months.

On the other hand, I don't want to pick a lab and then be shocked to find that my PI is completely callous about mental health issues, especially since, if I'm being realistic, there'll probably be at least one period during the next 5-6 years where my mental health issues interfere with my work. Also, I'm not going to wear long sleeves for the entirety of my PhD, and I'd rather my PI didn't feel ""duped"" and resent me for it. 

I'll mention this because it's relevant: this is at an R1 university in a ""top program."" Professors are probably, on average, less likely to be accommodating than at an R3 school, and it will be more competitive. During the interview we were told that the program tries to take care of its students once they're accepted, so that it's rigorous, but not brutally competitive within the program, and the mental health of grad students was brought up on more than one occasion, including resources and efforts to destigmatize it. This seemed to be reflected in the interactions I saw, however I know that to some extent it's too good to be true, and I like to think that my expectations are fairly realistic. I'm under no illusion that there will be hand-holding or heart-to-heart convos with my PI.

So, thoughts? You're not going to hurt my feelings. I really want honest answers, because I want to make an informed decision on this. Hell, if your opinion is ""everyone with mental illness is weak and needs to suck it up, and I'd never knowingly take on a student with mental illness"" and you're worried about downvotes, PM it to me. I really do want your honest thoughts. 

**TL;DR:** If self-harm scars would be a factor in very few PIs' decisions and perceptions, I won't cover them. If they would be a factor in many or most PIs' decisions, I'll cover them. Should I cover them? 

(final note: Yes, I know grad school puts a strain on mental health. Yes, I'm on meds and in therapy. And yes, I'm sure that grad school is the right decision for me)",37,2016-08-20 23:18:16
cd7j5y,LivelyLepton,t2_3qebkkyd,Mental health + Academia --- Do things get better mentally?,"Hi all,

I've experienced a general decline in my mental health over the last 12-18 months or so while in grad school. I just finished up my second year of graduate school and I'm seeing a therapist on campus to help me through my mental health issues. 

My question for you all: With appropriate therapy/counselling as needed, has your mental health gotten better while progressing through your career in academia?

I understand that the work load probably won't change much: I expect being a professor at an R1 university will entail working \~45-50 hours per week (as I do now). I expect there will be some balance of teaching, research, applying for grants, giving talks, mentoring my students, and general department work (in most ways the similar to as I do now, with some differences). I understand that there will be pressure to publish and to take on a large workload to secure tenure...but does it get a bit easier on you mentally?

When going through days where my mental health is particularly bad, I find that my deepest, darkest worry is that I will always be struggling with my mental health as badly as I am now. Those moments are pretty scary - and it's a shame, because I really love what I do and most of work that comes along with it.

Any thoughts on the matter - or any anecdotes that you'd care to share?

3mdb2r,batmuffino,t2_6llze,Exploitation of grad students or am I just overreacting?,"Most of the phd students at our institute are in a graduate program and have to gather credit points. One of the things they have to do is organizing 'social activities', e.g. organizing colloquia, gatherings of students etc. In the last three years however this wasn't once the case and credit points are usually awarded for 'volunteering' to set up the equipment for talks and seminars or being a member of the phd representatives. Generally it's stuff that PI's / the institutes administration doesn't want to. Usually it consists of simple tasks that take max. 1hr / 2 weeks.

Yesterday however, phd students were asked by email to help with an institute seminar by:

* Coming in on the weekend for 2 days x 8 hours
* Preparing coffee, lunch, set up of beamers etc.
* Do the dishes, clean everything

The students do not take part in said seminar.

Is this normal for graduate programs? Personally I come from a background where phd students don't have graduate programs and do not need to gather credit points. Asking them to come in over the weekend to do catering for something they have no relation too would have garnered rather serious questions about ones mental health.

What would you do? Shall I talk to the person offering this 'activities' and tell him I think it's a disgrace to ask people to work for essentially free. Go directly to the program manager and ask him what the academic goal of these exercises are? Or just ask the students if they would help me wash my car and do my dishes.... I would throw in some credit points on top and even a free pizza (seriously, it's so unimaginable for me to ask for something like this I still think it's a very convincing joke). Otherwise I could just ignore it. If the phd students don't speak up why should I?

However...the post requires me to relocate pretty quickly (in the next 3 weeks). As its just for a year, my partner will be staying in our house (own the house, his job is perm, we have a great dog-walking set up for our high maintenance boy etc.), so it'll be just me looking for somewhere to rent. 

I should be happy, but I feel awful. We lived apart for the majority of my PhD, and I just don't know if I can do it again, even if it is for a year. I feel uneasy about FT contracts at the best of times, and keep envisaging us being in this same position next year, deciding whether to look for another FT post just so I can stay in academia. 

We live in a small northern city with not much going on in my field. I could look for a non-academic job and take a smaller wage, or retrain in a different field and make the move further north where those skills are needed. 

Partner is supportive either way, and we're both agreed there's no point us both relocating for my FT post, especially when he has a permanent role. 

I'm pretty jaded with academia the moment, I should probably add - treatment of staff, student fees, redundancies etc. It's pretty depressing and I don't know if I could cope with it long term.

3mq68q,IsUniversityForMe,t2_qslxd,"I wanted to join academia, but university is ruining my mental health","Hello,


Since I am a child, joining academia has always been my dream. This is why, after finishing high school, I gladly joined the history department of a famous university in my country, and I was aiming at a Ph.D. Of course I was full of dreams and did not know what the real world was ... But I still keep an interest for academia. I still read many academic journals to stay up to date with the news, I sometimes message researchers in fields that interest me to get more information about their researches and we sometimes had interesting talks, I study all the ancient-languages required by myself (they should be studied later in my curriculum, but I decided to study them in my free time anyway), I keep a blog about my personal ""researches"" (I use """" because as you can imagine from an undergraduate in 3rd year, they are not breaking news, nor super advanced things, I just go to the library, read primary and secondary sources, learn new things, analyze them, and write on my blog about it) ... And this makes me very happy, happier and more excited than I have ever been ... And there is a but. University. Of course to get a Ph. D. I would need to spend more and more years in the university, graduating, getting a master degree and a Ph.D. , which would take me 7-8 years, probably more. And I think I cannot do it. Since my first year at the university, I have been sad and unhappy. Sometimes I can spend my entire time crying everyday for weeks, and it has been like that since the beginning. Sometimes I even become suicidal. Of course I seeked help, but it does not achieve much. It's just the idea of going to the university that makes me sick. The lectures, the homework, ... You could probably tell me that I should just deal with it and that we have all been through this, and that would probably be true, I am disappointed in myself, I see so many people about to do it, get their Ph.D. and I don't understand why I could not do it ... But the thing is, as disappointing as it is, it seems like it cannot be helped. At least what I know is that I will probably not be able to make it until the Ph.D. , but I also know that the only things that manage to keep me a bit happy are my pseudo-researches... And I want to continue to be able to do that. 


So now come my questions. Let's suppose that I just stop going to the university (something I am actually actively considering) and do a job that I would be able to stand (I have some possibilities), while keeping on doing my researches. Let's suppose I one day manage to ""discover"" (my English is not good enough, I know it is not the right word, but I don't know which one would be better) something new, what kind of credibility would I have? Would I even be able to publish that in a journal? If not, what would be your advice for someone like me? I admit I am completely lost with a life I thought I had figured out.",31,2015-09-28 17:55:58
8vryht,Sadthrowaway667,,failing my PhD,"Another 'should I quit post'... 

I'm in my 4th year of a PhD in Creative Writing in the UK. I took it because I thought it would be a good way to 'follow my passion' but continue to build a career track; I was naive.

I was fully funded for 3 years, then my stipend ran out so I transferred to part time status and have been working full time as an administrative assistant in a local firm. Luckily I'm not in debt because my fees were still funded. There's no reason for it to have taken this long. I could have finished last year and I don't have a good excuse for not doing so except I was so depressed.

The PhD requires a novel with a 20k theoretical thesis that is thematically linked. I've finished the novel but my research thesis is terrible. With 4 weeks left, my supervisor doesn't think I can finish it on time to the required standard and she is probably right. I have written only 11k and it's like reading an undergraduate dissertation. 

The only reason I haven't quit already is because I don't want to let her down. I don't want to work in academia any more and even if I did there are few jobs. I'm really depressed with how badly I suck at this and how much time I've wasted on a useless degree. I cry all the time and I don't know how I can go on.

I wanted to quit 2 years ago but after talking with my supervisor agreed to stay on. She had a lot of confidence in me and I've just let her down over and over. 

Since I have my job in administration, I could quit the PhD and apart from the time I've spent here, I would be okay. My job doesn't pay that well but it's more money than my stipend was and I really enjoy doing it. But I am my supervisor's first PhD student ever and I don't want to make her look bad. However she has lost patience with me and I think would rather terminate me at this point! All my problems are my own because I didn't communicate well with her. I didn't even tell her when my grandmother died which is what started this whole tailspin. 

Now my options are to apply for an extension, hope for major corrections, or quit. I flip between these options constantly. The toll this has taken on my mental health has been big and sometimes I worry I'm not safe. My self esteem is on the floor. I am in the university counselling which has been helping. 

What makes this worse is the feeling that it's not even a respectable degree..  while my colleagues in STEM are doing useful stuff I've achieved nothing much. I was a great student in undergraduate and during my MA, I wish I had stuck to proper research instead of trying to follow my dreams or whatever.

I think I have to scrape through to the end and I'll make it through somehow.

When I was 15, my parents -- classic irresponsible hippie types, with classic irresponsible ''the *school of life* is more important than a stuffy classroom'' attitude --  pulled me out of school so that we could travel the world together. 

More recently I had some mental health issues, which meant I couldn't go to community college. But, I am an autodidact. I've read excessively for most of my life, everything from trashy fiction to academic textbooks. 

Now that i'm back in the UK and healthy enough, I would love to finally be able to go to university. Specifically, I've been looking at Brighton's BA Digital Film course and Bath Spa's BA Film, Television and Digital Production course.

My portfolio would consist of...
 
* 3 polished 3-to-15-page short stories. 
 
* A finished short-film script with storyboards. 

 
* A finished graphic-novel script with storyboards, notes, a pitch, character and location concept arts, and 3 finished pages illustrated by a professional artist. 
 

* Photographs of some costumes and props I've made, to show I can work well with textiles and materials. 
 

* some 'photographs' of scenes made in Blender.

 
* Possibly some sculpture, if my parents haven't thrown out my pottery.

I wont be able to make a film, since, having only recently returned to the UK, I don't know anybody here well enough to ask them to help me with it, so I wouldn't be comfortable with the film's final quality.

What I'm asking is: will I be able to apply for a film course in the UK as a mature student if I don't have a film or any formal schooling, provided I have a portfolio that shows I have skills relevant to the course?

Do you have any tips for applying for university as a mature student?",30,2016-10-08 15:46:08

I've got some time left in my current position and plenty left to finish to keep myself occupied in the short-term, but in the long-term I've got to acknowledge that I don't enjoy it anymore, I'm just not cut out for the lifestyle, I want more security and predictability so that I can start a family, and I just don't have the qualities that rising PIs seem to have.

So I need, at minimum, a sabbatical of sorts. More likely I'd want to close the lab notebook for the last time and move on to something else.

Aside from the ""new year new me"" thing, I'm looking to set myself some goals concerning my work in academia and my PhD. This year I've struggled a bit with imposter syndrome, and I need to get my head on board with the work I'm doing and work on my mental health throughout the process. I'm interested to hear of any new year's resolutions people have made previously, or for 2018, in terms of being more productive and reducing mental stress.

I was sick with a fever and missed two classes and the last two I've missed because some days forcing myself out of bed is just unbearable, even if I'm not sleepy. The first couple times, I was on top of it and emailed my prof prior to let him know I would miss class because I was sick and asked what I missed. The last time (today) not so much --- but I just got an email from him letting me know that if I miss anymore classes my final grade would be a D or F. 

I was planning on asking to meet with him the morning before our next class, so I can catch up on discussions I've missed, ask some questions about the readings, show that I'm interested in the topic, but I don't know how to go about explaining my absence. I'm tempted to just lie and say I've had the flu/fever, but who is sick for four weeks straight? Should I be honest and tell him the real reason why I missed the last two classes? I feel like if I were him, I wouldn't buy the real reason and think the student was just skipping/didn't care.

bs10d9,throwaway190218,t2_38ycfj5w,How to tell my narcissistic boss I am leaving?,"Using my throwaway for privacy reasons…

Next week, I will have to tell my boss that I will be leaving a postdoc position early. I am leaving because of him and the very toxic working environment he creates at our institution. 

I know narcissism is a word that gets thrown around a lot, however I have a strong suspicion my boss must at least be somewhere on the narcissistic spectrum. He can be a very charming person at first sight (that is also why I had no idea what I was getting myself into); yet he is also a terrible micromanager with anger issues (anything can set him off anytime, and he constantly creates problems out of non-issues), everything is always about him and nothing is ever his fault (he is also very easily offended and takes everything as a personal insult). My institution turns out to have a history of people leaving early (because of him). 

I made a lot of personal sacrifices for this position. For example, I have moved countries, while my family stayed behind. In the meantime, I am not getting any research done (I am almost two years in and still have no publication in sight, because of all the drama going on and the menial tasks my boss keeps swamping me with), my mental health is deteriorating (I suffer from a lot of stress-related issues and I feel burned-out), and my family is in another country. In other words, this job is not getting me anywhere and it is all just not worth it.

I could really use some advice on how to handle this conversation I am going to have next week. On the one hand, I want my boss to know, that I am leaving because of our toxic relationship (the mere fact that I am leaving, he will probably take as a personal insult anyways). On the other hand, I am afraid that will do me no good, as I am in a relative small field of study and he holds power (at least to some extent) over my career. Also, I am in the process of applying for other positions, but I have currently no job lined up…

17y5ml,turtledief,t2_5x5x9,academic inbreeding,"What do you think about ""academic inbreeding"" (i.e. completing a BA + PhD in the same degree at the same school)? Does it actually matter in this present day, or is this kind of fear and stigma a relic of older eras, when people didn't have efficient ways to communicate with each other?

I'm asking mainly because I have gotten offers from two of my top-choice schools. One is my undergraduate university, where I have been offered full funding; basically, I'll be set for six or seven years in the form of grants, fellowships, etc. Additionally, this university has unmatched resources in the USA and is regarded as one of the best programs, if not the best, in the world. I get along well with the faculty, and my research interests line up extremely well with my potential advisor (who is currently my undergrad advisor). She is an up-and-coming scholar in the field on tenure-track, and she (thankfully!) cares about the mental health of her students. I can't claim she is extremely well-published as she is up-and-coming, but she does good work. (Other things of note: Two profs in the department are also retiring soon and are guaranteed to be replaced by newer, younger scholars.)

As for the other university, it is also a very good place, though less so than my undergrad university! I have not received news of the funding situation yet, but as far as I'm aware, they typically cannot guarantee funding for all five years, especially for out-of-state students; I would have to renew it year after year and establish residency in the state for tuition purposes. My potential advisor there is a middle-aged, extremely well-published, world-respected and world-class expert in the field (read: hotshot). Our research interests do not line up as well, but they do intersect at down the line, and I would be very honored to study under him. I can't speak as to his temperament, not having met him yet, but I do plan to visit next month.

All in all, I'm a little torn. On the one hand, there's security (financial, mental, social). On the other, there's this better-respected advisor and the fear of ""academic inbreeding"" and how that may affect my chances of employment years down the line. The profs in my department whom I've spoken to have all told me they don't think inbreeding is a big problem, especially in light of the school's reputation and the fact they are hiring two new profs. But, well, of course they'd reassure me of that considering how much money they threw at me, and when people look at my CV, they won't see, ""Was exposed to new ideas, two profs hired during enrollment.""

So, in an attempt to get some real talk, I've come to reddit, of course. What are your thoughts about academic inbreeding and how that affects employment opportunities, the development of a scholar, and anything else you want to talk about?

95g8kz,truetrans,,"How to ""let go"" or ""fire"" an unproductive paid undergraduate researcher?","Hi.

I am about to be a 3rd year PHD student and I am faced with a difficult situation. I have an undergraduate researcher who has been underperforming all summer. She is routinely late with excuses such as ""slipped on a puddle on the way to the bus"" which I highly doubt due to both 95+ degree temperature and slipping in a puddle shouldn't cause you to lose the bus. I know she has physical health and mental health issues, but she has missed work (and often still logged hours saying she will work from home not really asking permission). The other student researcher and her are working on data entry. One day the student I wish to let go (fire) did 1 entry as opposed to 12 that the other student did. Part of their research is to do reading and report to me as I want to teach them to review articles and become minor scholars in the field as undergraduate students. She misses these constantly, and she is 3 days late on this last one. This is 9 working hours that she doesnt seem to have read or wrote a response. I already give them 3 hours to do this a week. 

She was about to take a summer class which would have left her with no working hours in the day, a convenient way for me to ""let her go"" without having to confront her. I am only a 29 year old PhD student and have never had to fire someone. She now, having really underperformed while I was away, says she will work for free and work extra and drop her summer class. This is the same tune she has sang before and I don't want her to drop her summer class. regardless I want her last day to be the end of next week. I can't imagine being able to write her a letter of recommendation. It's also hard as she is a student with a lot of adversity thrown her way. But it doesn't give her an excuse to log work hours and do nothing. 

The most awkward part is that out of my two student employees (one good, one bad) that they were both already good friends before working for me. I didn't know this was the case. So now I don't want to alienate the good employee by letting go of the other. 

Have you ever had to let someone go in your research group? How can you do this without making the whole team feel odd? How can I do this and save face? Any advice or anecdotes are welcome. Thank you all",26,2018-08-07 22:17:21
56dsbc,Feight0,t2_gbiy6,Had to make a tough decision between two grad school's and I'm having buyer's remorse. Please help!,"I'm going to have to use specifics to accurately describe my situation, so hopefully no one I know too well is perusing on here.

School I didn't choose: UC Berkeley. Reasons: smaller solar energy program (I'm going to graduate school for solar energy). Heard that my top professor I wanted to work with required unreasonably long hours, moreso than the typical grad professor.  Thought that I might not like the Bay area.

School I chose: Arizona State University. Reason: Liked the personality of the professor here the most. Large solar energy program.

The regrets:  

1. I grew up 30 minutes away from ASU and I also did my undergrad there. I didn't think it would be a big deal deciding to come to graduate school here, as I'm not one for travelling, but I feel EXTREMELY restless now, and every morning I wake up resenting the fact that I'm essentially at the same spot as I've been my entire life.

2. My professor at ASU is new and doesn't have a lab yet.  Not to knock on him, he's an amazing guy, it just makes things harder.

3. Found out the professor at Berkeley I would have worked with is essentially doing very similar research with solar that I am doing at ASU.

4. I feel dumber and dumber every day for the fact that I got into one of the top schools in the country and decided to stay at ASU. 

All this is wrapped up in the complication that I have some mental health issues, so it's hard to trust my feelings on anything. On top of this I haven't really had friends for over 2 years now, so there's no one to talk to about any of this, hence the long Reddit post.  My parents suggest that I talk to both my professor at ASU and the one I would have had at Berkeley and be honest with them and ask about switching schools after a year. I just feel like there are so many problems with that approach. I would feel terrible about committing to a research project only to leave after a year, and who knows if Berkeley would even accept me again, especially after what will look like a failed start to grad school that would be on my resume and the fact that I turned them down already.

Even a single reply would mean the world to me.  I don't know if I should stick with my decision and try to find ways to cope with it, or if I should start the long journey to trying to switching schools, with the possibility that it will backfire horribly and sour my good relationship with the professor I'm currently working with. 

Edit: Just realized that anyone from my grad program will easily be able to tell this is me. A little awkward, but I don't care I guess. Hey guys! :D Your advice is welcome as well!

Basically, if you are a resident of Texas and you're at least 10 years removed from your coursework, you can go back to school for a new degree, and the GPA of the classes 10 years ago would be as if they don't exist. One could use this as a stepping stone for admission to Texas's graduate programs (but only for those in Texas).

I personally like this idea. I've seen a lot of threads in /r/gradadmissions about people having low GPA's due to mental or physical health issues, family issues, financial issues, or just immaturity, and resolving these issues to end up with higher GPA's for the last few years. Yet due to the previous failures, their cumulative GPA is doomed to be low, and this would hurt greatly their chances to get into good grad programs. I don't think that these people should be penalized for their past failures, especially if it was such a long time ago and they have proven their academic ability eventually.

Trying to get a bit of feedback from PhD students who quit their program proper before completing the degree - why did you do it? Feel free to free-form your answer or address any of the big-picture elements below.

* Were the major reasons more personal (mental health, being a parent, warped concept of what this doctoral work entailed,...) or program-related (bad advisor / PI, specific project stumbling blocks,...)?

* How did you come to the final decision? Was there a particular tipping point, a gradual buildup,...?

* What did you do afterwards? Industry, following a passion unrelated to your subject of study, simply up and leaving the bloody place to roam nomadically,...?

* If you stayed in a similar field, but just moved to industry or lower academic position, did you have any concerns about future potential work-related interactions with faculty / academics from the school you left? (Even if you didn't majorly ""burn bridges"" and left with dignity.) The issue of reputation as a professional in the field, essentially.

* Did you ever go back into academia / a doctoral program at a different institution later on?

A while ago I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/569lnt/undergrads_with_mental_illnesses/). Thank you all for your comments.

Last week, PI expressed concern because I looked unwell again, so he did the usual ""have you been sleeping properly, have you eaten more than one meal today, etc"" thing. I told him that I have been ""sick"" which he thought meant a cold or flu, but I explained that it is a long-term illness. He asked me what it was but I said I'd rather not. I also explained that I'm not asking for any accommodations or special treatment or advice or responsibility reductions, but I am only sharing as an explanation of my performance and weird habits. I've also shared the exact same information with three other profs that I trust after they've asked me about my health, including his spouse, who is another one of my profs this term.

All of them were incredibly kind and expressed concern for my well-being. They strongly encouraged me to prioritize my health over school and work, and said that I can ask for help any time. The profs whose class I'm taking now said that they would understand if I couldn't do readings here and there. I assured them that wouldn't be necessary. Two of them guessed that it's something to do with stress (PI's spouse's first suggestion was therapy, unfortunately this means she knows) and PI has alluded to or explicitly discussed mental illness with/around me before, so he probably has assumptions too. In any case I am still having trouble taking care of myself- eating, sleeping, social situations, focusing on exam preparation and ""being present"" are very difficult for me. Out of respect for them and their time, I won't ask for any help though they have offered it. I explained that I can handle it myself, and that as an adult and a student at a top-20 R1 institution I have an obligation to handle it myself, and that I don't want to be even more of a burden on them. Hopefully this helped them understand that I am not trying to be manipulative or clingy or make excuses for incompetence.

That being said, I regret telling them anything, because now they probably feel the need to be very careful around me and treat me like a fragile cry-baby instead of an adult and an aspiring professor. They likely only said kind things out of obligation/politeness. I might even lose my RA job. I don't know what to do now and I have no one to turn to. I should distance myself further from faculty, but I don't know how to do that without making them think I resent/distrust them or hurting my chances of getting good letters and continuing a mentor relationship during/after my undergraduate degree.",21,2016-10-19 17:12:43
3enr9j,Paradiddle234,t2_p33go,Seriously considering leaving my PhD program - advice?,"I am 4 years through a 6 year PhD program in Biology from a big name school. I'm an international student on an F1 visa, so I moved to the US specifically to complete this program.

Four years down and I am desperate to leave. My physical and mental health have both suffered due to the stress of the program and also a difficult relationship with my advisor, and my productivity has slowed to a halt. At my current rate of data generation, I'm afraid that I won't have enough to satisfy my committee and graduate two years from now. I'm not enjoying the project, and the thought of switching to a new project with the same advisor makes me feel depressed and anxious. The rest of my lab is wonderful - I would be really sad to stop working with my colleagues, but I have worked very very hard on trying to find a synergistic relationship with my advisor, and frankly I've lost my trust in this person. I'm very resentful of many past events and the style in which my advisor chooses to ""advise"", which is very controlling and critical.

I've learnt that I want to work in science but the kinds of jobs I want are typically advertised at the Masters level. I want something 9-5-ish, field is flexible. I am very motivated by feeling useful and by working in close collaboration with other scientists (I think part of the struggle I've had with PhD is that I don't enjoy the solitude of being solely responsible for completion of my project). I'm happy to work overtime occasionally but I want to have evenings and weekends to myself, for the most part. 

So! If I left, I would have a Masters in Biology from a big name school, and plenty of experience (4 years from PhD work + 4 years research experience prior to this). I am confident that I could have a fulfilling career without a PhD. My major issue is that I don't want to leave the city where I'm currently in school! It feels like home now. But I'm dependent on my student visa. I would be able to apply for OPT extension of my visa after graduating with a Masters, I believe, but this extension lasts at most two and a half years. I believe my only other options are:
-H1B visa, of which there are a limited number available per year.
-Green card by employment sponsorship, which AFAIK is typically only offered to employees who have been working at a company for a number of years.
-Green card by Diversity Visa Lottery, which of course is luck of the draw. I'm from a country that is eligible and has a relatively high rate of winners per number of entrants, though.
-Green card by marriage. My partner is a US citizen but marriage isn't on the table right now, and I don't think either of us really like the institution of marriage anyway. And of course marrying someone does not guarantee that a green card application will be approved.

I'm seeking advice from my department and career services at my school, but I would love advice from anyone who has the time and inclination to provide it. Thank you!

My PhD in no way contributed to my breakdown, and I've said it over and over again throughout the last month that I think it's the only part of my life that isn't a massive pressure point for my mental health. 

I've not returned to university since _the incident_ so I'm no longer studying, or working at the university. My income has dropped from a steady £600 a month to nothing and we definitely needed that money to keep our house ticking over so that's another huge factor.

I have no idea how to come back after this, either financially or practically and I've never felt so far away from getting my bloody literature review actually completed. I'm almost embarrassed to return and I have the added bonus of absolute word soup when trying to communicate, which isn't exactly fitting of a doctoral student. Describing cheese as ""hard milk"" hasn't been my finest moment. 

Any advice? I know MH is a huge issue for PhD students but I can't seem to find anyone who's been where I am right now who can give practical, realistic advice beyond ""it's going to be okay"". ",21,2019-03-21 20:05:45
8xvhir,hellohello2204,,Why don't people liken the difficulty of getting into a Ph.D. program to the difficulty of getting into Med School?,"I, like many others, was under the impression that hard work and determination (and good grades and lab experience) was enough to get into Ph.D. programs. While this is a part of it, a lot of it is luck/networking. Not to mention the job market once you graduate... 

I've since switched focus to a career in health care/mental health for a better work life balance, while keeping the creative/problem part of myself alive. Still, so many people ask me why I ""gave up on my dreams."" They seem to think good grades and some lab work is enough. They also don't understand the dedication involved in being an academic if you \*do\* graduate and get a job. (A job, AKA 2-3 post docs, an adjunct position, then maaaybe TT, etc).

Why do people not seem to realize getting into programs is as hard, if not harder, than getting into med school? Also, why do people seem to think academia is basically being a fancy teacher and pay is commensurate with the title? ",20,2018-07-11 01:53:08

478rx9,fuckyoulymedisease,t2_ulkds,How do I know if a Ph.D is the right track for me (as opposed to a master's)?,"I've always partially wanted to do a Ph.D, but it seemed like a silly pipe dream, since I worked two, occasionally three jobs while going to school full time as an undergrad, so research wasn't an option for me. I did TA for three semesters because I could get away with telling my bosses it was a class so they usually respected that. Now I've been out 9 months working an awful, shitty, horrible full time job that got me put on Prozac because I hate it so much. 

Going back to school is my only way out, so I decided to accelerate my go-back-to-school-someday plan. I was just going to bite the bullet and take out loans for a master's, just to get away from this job, but I was talking with a former advisor who suggested I go all the way to a Ph.D since I had excelled at the research work in the class and I had a solid overall GPA, excellent major GPA, and got a 164V 154Q on the GRE, plus he knew my economic situation and that I had a chance of getting a stipended position if I did a Ph.D instead. It wasn't an offer or anything, nor would I pursue that route, as his classes were outside of my primary interest and I have no desire to return to my undergrad alma mater, but it got me thinking. I did my undergraduate degree in counseling and human services with a concentration in social policy, and I want to pursue health psychology, specifically the psychology of the American work culture and its effects on physical and mental health. I've found a few programs that are a good fit for me, but how do I know if I'm actually smart enough or talented enough or even passionate enough to pursue a Ph.D?

7sm1zb,NoxiousQuadrumvirate,,Disclosing mental illness to supervisors,"[Australia / Astrophysics / Honours]

I'm in Honours currently, officially moving into my office on Monday. I also have schizophrenia. 

One supervisor has said that even 20 years out of his Honours year, he'd still consider it the most stressful year of his life, so I know I'm in for a tough time for the next ~9 months. Normally I'd just supply my disability accommodations for exams (as I did for my undergraduate degree) and leave it at that since the risk is so low for a spontaneous decline, but I think the stress of this year changes the rules a bit. Also, considering my condition is not something many people will typically have experience with, I think an open discussion between us could help. Descriptions online are not forgiving towards the illness, and many describe something far more debilitating than I experience. 

I already have a full support team that I meet with on a weekly basis, and in light of all of the warnings for stress, I've changed my medication routine so that I no longer have much autonomy over it (regular supervised injections instead of pills). I pay people to keep tabs on my cognitive functioning and to intervene if it changes, so I don't expect any of the university staff to take on any significant role. The only real risk would be an incredibly fast decline in functioning, and it'd be very obvious that I wasn't well. In that case the university policy would be to contact my health provider, but I feel like they should be aware of it beforehand just so they don't call the police (I'm not violent), and so they're not completely unprepared.

How should I go about having this discussion, or is it even worth having at all? I do trust my supervisors and have no reason to believe that I'll face discrimination from them, but it's an awkward topic for a lot people.",17,2018-01-24 09:52:56

How much does prestige of grad school matter?,"I'm getting my PhD in chemistry, and I hope to become a professor at a liberal arts college. I have been accepted to three schools. One is top tier, one is mid tier, and one is bottom tier. (All three are RU/VH.) I'm having a hard time with the decision, and I need some insight. 

- I want to be close to family:
Bottom tier school is 30 minutes away. It's in my home state. I would be happy to teach at some of the schools in my home state.

- Research is not the most important thing in my life:
I am not a workaholic. I will not stay awake thinking about my work until the wee hours in the morning. The top tier school is a pressure cooker, and I'm more likely to have mental health issues if I go there. Mid tier is slightly more laid back, but it's still grad school. 5th year grad students at the bottom tier school said that 40-50 hours a week is the norm. It is a very relaxed department.

- I want to like the research at least a little:
Top school is amazing. Everything is awesome. Funding and resources are not even a little bit of an issue. 
Mid school has cool stuff happening. I would be happy doing that work.
Bottom tier school has only one professor I would want to work for, and even that research wasn't that exciting to me.

b9fq4b,AdmiralLunatic,t2_bhxd192,To switch or not to switch... when it comes to advisors,"Here's the background:

I'm an international student who originally came to the US to pursue my Master's. After a semester, I realized that I really want to a PhD, and some of the professors I had been talking to advised that its better to switch to PhD, since a Master's is ""not essential"", and that I'd be saving more time that way. 

Around the same time, my current advisor came to know about my interests, and he as well was looking for a PhD student. We talked a few times, and I eventually decided to switch from the very next semester. Being new to the whole US educational/academic system, I did not know what to look for in an advisor. 

Being someone who switched to academia recently from the industry, he did not have any first-authored publications on his resume, and I did not think too much about it back then. He asked me to explore certain fields, and to try and find a research problem. Unfortunately, his suggestions were way too broad, and being new to this, I ended up spending my first six months trying to do literature review.

Enter his new post-doc. Now this is when things started to change. Within a couple of months of this post-doc joining, I learned more about how to do research and the importance of evaluating novelty of ideas before we started on something. This wasn't something that I felt my advisor was focusing on. I started to see the difference between an academic researcher (the post-doc) and someone from the industry (my advisor). As opposed to the post-doc, my adviser wasn't as much concerned about triviality, novelty and perception of the academic community. He wanted to find something interesting and important and to do research on that topic.

Soon after that, I started assisting the post-doc on different projects and I started to learn how to see things differently. I realized that I'd need his assistance more to succeed in my PhD with better publications. Unfortunately he left after a year, but he still assists me to this day.

With my advisor, we finally ended up focusing on a field of research. However, being in inter-disciplinary research between CS and social sciences, he often gets swayed to the ""other field"" rather than the one in which I can get papers in. His ideas are way broad and out of reach compared to our capabilities and focus. I've had to argue for hours to make him understand that we'll be setting ourselves up for failure if we focus on vague interpretations and ideas. And whats worse, it seems that I had been chasing a ghost when it comes to research. Its been 3.5 years and I don't have a single paper to show. In my field, that's extremely uncommon (with students publishing up to 1-2 papers a year).

If you're wondering why I haven't switched advisors yet, its because hes an excellent human being. I say this because I haven't been the ideal PhD student either. I've had to deal with multiple mental and physical health issues in this 3.5 years and ended up taking a 5 month break. He was supportive of all this and always helped me get through it all. He even stopped me from dropping out at the worst phase, and gave me room to think about it through. And if it wasn't for that, I would've dropped out a two years ago.

You see, I'm in a dilemma. I'm afraid I might not have the qualifications for industry or academia if I follow down this path, but at the same time, I really don't want to change advisors. What would you have done if you were in my shoes? What advise do you have for me?",15,2019-04-04 17:30:59

6sx930,midnightsometime,,I have a BA in Christian Studies from a regionally accredited school. What are my options?,"Hello, I'll try to keep this brief. I graduated spring 2016 with a degree in Christian Studies from a regionally accredited religious institution. I did not learn any ancient or foreign languages and was not very involved with the campus life or extracurricular activities (due to mental health issues). I am currently looking at graduate programs 1 year later and am trying to access what my options are. I have no desire to go to seminary, seeing as my interest in theology/religion is academic. I have been looking at some religious studies programs, (ASU, and UNC) but would also be interested in studying theology as well. 

Ultimately, I am concerned that I am not an attractive applicant for any program. I did not know my professors well and thus have poor references. I do not know french, German, Hebrew, or Greek. And somehow after four years of college I do not have a writing sample that exceeds 10 pages (I am worried that I do not have any at all backed up seeing as my laptop was stolen). With that being said I am extremely interested in religion and theology and would be more then happy to study almost any facet of the  two at any institute that would take me. I am just worried that I will have trouble getting accepted almost anywhere. The one saving grace of my undergrad is that I graduated with a 4.0, however I realize that is probably not very important in comparison to writing samples and references. 

I was wondering if anyone could point me toward what types of programs I should be looking at, if I am primarily interested in religious studies, theology, and philosophy of religion. I have been looking at programs online, but am uninformed as to which are more competitive and ultimately which I would have a chance of being admitted to.

Would it be knowledge worth having?**

(sorry for bad English – not a native speaker)

I'm an RA for a professor (not STEM, so no lab, and I'm the only RA there who does anything substantive, ie more than just data entry – we've coauthored a paper, etc). I'm an undergraduate and I've been mentally ill since ~13 years of age. That being said, I've managed to do extremely well in school, getting a full ride to my current university, getting this RA job, keeping a 3.7+ GPA, doing independent research on the side. I'm also good at my job – I've had it for a couple of years already, I complete tasks on time/ahead of time, I put in maximum effort, and the professor praises me often both in front of me and to other faculty when I'm not around. There's always room for improvement, but still. Besides that, he's somewhat of a mentor to me, helping me navigate graduate school applications (different, but related, field); I know his family and they've had me over for holidays and such. Sometimes he asks me about my family and upbringing, which were horrible as I was abused as a child. I've kept my responses short and vague every time, so he doesn't know anything other than that I don't talk to one parent at all anymore and limit my interactions with the other.

I've been even more stressed out than usual lately, and he can tell. He knows I'm not eating regularly or sleeping properly. Last month, he even went so far as to somewhat nonchalantly ask me if I had recently had a panic attack after I mentioned being worried about something. As far as I know, my condition hasn't affected my performance at work, and my grades are the same as they've always been. I'm worried that he might already be drawing negative conclusions about me. *Given that this might be the case, should I mention my mental illness in vague terms? Is it worth the risk at all?* Of course I won't say ""mental illness"" at all, more something along the lines of  ""I have been dealing with some health issues for a while, but I'm still trying my best at school and at work, and I don't have any additional expectations of you,"" etc. I want to preserve, or even improve, what is already a good relationship, and I don't want the professor to think I'm incompetent or dangerous or weird (projecting childhood hang-ups, etc)",15,2016-10-07 04:08:54

be1eu1,8261049375,t2_3m2pbgqt,Returning to an institution after 8 Years,"Hi, /r/askacademia 

This is a throwaway account for reasons that will become clear in a moment. 

As an undergrad, I was reasonably accomplished, and entered my institution's 5th year BA/MA program when my post-senior year plans fell through. However, in that last year, my sister became gravely ill, and had to be institutionalized against her will. It tore my family apart, and my mental health with it. (There are only so many times you can take your mother sobbing on the other end of the phone about how she doesn't want to bury her child.) 

I had a major depressive episode, and turtled, HARD -- I holed up in my apartment, stopped going to class, and at one point I didn't speak to another human for almost a week. I ended up getting an incomplete for all my classes that semester, and while I tried to make up the work, it was just too much to do. I left without completing the MA. 

Now, nearly eight years later, things have changed. I got married, taught at a university abroad, and have vastly improved my mental health. I've applied -- with support from some mentors -- to graduate study. There are only four universities in the USA that offer the Master's program I'm looking for, and my alma mater was one of them. I was accepted, with full funding at my alma mater, and with less funding or no funding elsewhere, so I'm returning. 

At one level, the obstacle has been overcome -- after a proper master's degree, my previous failure 8 years ago becomes less relevant to doctoral admissions committees, and clearly my interim work was good enough to get a scholarship. 

However, there remains the matter of ruptured relationships. Three of the four scholars I ghosted that semester are still at the school, and at Admitted Students Weekend (which I attended), one was on a faculty panel. I shook her hand afterward, and after telling me that I looked familiar, I told her my name. The look of shock on her face was… something. She said she was grateful that I was resuming my studies. I'm now writing thank you notes to everyone I met at the weekend, hers is the last one, and I've got nothing.

So, /r/askacademia , do you have any words of wisdom, or any advice? It's weird to be an eight-year prodigal son, but I don't know how to approach these scholars. I want to apologize, I want to get back to work, I don't particularly want to discuss the past, I don't want to have permanently burned bridges.

l9o0qt,PaintMePanda,t2_29tfkjm3,Difficult group members - is it unprofessional to ask prof to put me in a different group?," I'm in a group for a semester-long group project (worth 20%) and I am noticing that my group members are not willing to incorporate feedback and are really sensitive to constructive criticism. All of them are 2-3 years younger than me so there is a knowledge gap and gap in professionalism/experience in group work.

The main issue is that my group members are not listening to my feedback and have a rude tone if I disagree with something. I try to be understanding, but it's hard when they write things that don't make sense/are incorrect ex. writing ""The *X-axis* which is gene \_\_ is the *dependent* variable"", which is opposite of what's correct. They wouldn't understand me explaining that this is wrong and we need to switch the terminology and are very sensitive to criticism.

I am worried for my grades as I am applying to grad schools this year. I am also worried about my mental health as I already have a lot going on at home right now due to a family member with mental illness and addictions and I don't want this to impact my performance in other courses as well.

However, I sometimes wonder if this is something not practical for project-based researchers (i.e. postdocs) in STEM fields. There are times when I would like to take some time off for my mental health only to be given a pushback by my boss for wanting to get an experiment done as soon as possible. I understand why because I've been getting a lot of mixed results from this experiment and time is ticking on my contract.  

With this, I would feel compelled to compromise my mental health in favour of getting those experiments done.

8d2sc6,obviouscucumber,,Do I have grounds for a lawsuit against my university?,"Sorry in advance for the lengthy post.  

I am a 4th year PhD student in the US who suffers from anxiety and Major Depressive Disorder.  These conditions interfered with my ability to complete my preliminary exam and prompted a medical leave from school.  I was told that this ""failure"" would not be counted as one of my two attempts to take this exam if it was excused with a medical note, which it was.  I have this in an email from my advisor.  On return from medical leave, which in retrospect was too soon, the same interference and panic attacks started to happen again.  I found much better medical care than I had previously been utilizing (which was not covered by my insurance because our school only offers us very limited mental health options which I did not find to be adequate) and my doctors suggested I take another medical leave.  This time the request was denied due to this being my second ""failed"" attempt (""failed"" is in quotes because neither attempts were ever completed due to my deteriorating mental health at the time).  I have been trying to deal with this through my university since January, when the provost informed me that my program is not actually allowed to grant medical leaves or returns themselves and it must go through the university's student services office.  Upon contacting this office, they have said they can help figure it out, but have been extremely slow and I still have no idea what is going on with anything.  

There are more places where I believe my university has acted with negligence, including the head of my program informing me that my first medical leave was granted at a seminar in front of all of my peers, my advisor insisting I disclose details of my mental health to my entire committee despite me letting her know that it made me uncomfortable.  There is also a somewhat unrelated history of the head of my program making extremely mysogonistic comments to me in particular and to entire groups at seminars.
I am not really sure what legal grounds I might have for any sort of case.  I feel like I have been discriminated against for my mental illness.  I feel like the whole ordeal, and the length of it all has greatly increased my mental suffering.  I feel like even if they do grant me a leave now, after missing an entire semester trying to figure this all out, I will not be able to return to finish my degree resulting in lost wages for the near future, but much more so for my cumulative income.  

Do you think I should seek out a lawyer locally? Is this worth my time and money to pursue?  Any help is much appreciated!",11,2018-04-18 03:57:00
4zdv8g,propheticdreams,t2_10buf1,Looking to study rural flight/Incentivizing Back-to-the-land movements,"A quick bit of background. Undergrad I was double majoring in Anthro and Film, transferred schools, through misleading information my anthro program at the new school accepted my previous anthro credits only as hours toward graduation, not as Anthro courses. It was a bit of a mess, I ended up only graduating with a film degree and a fair GPA (3.8), nothing special.

3 years after graduating I've still been trying to find a niche to return to academia and after much discourse I believe I've found a topic I'm passionate enough about. But I have a few considerations and questions that I hope someone could help with. 

Topic: I want to study movement from rural areas and farming communities toward urban population centers. Furthermore I want to study ways to combat this through small farm development incentives. I grew up in Southern WV and have seen communities shrink from 100,000 to just over 20,000. I want to study this from a number of angles, economic impact, mental/physical health, mega-population logistics.

Considerations:

1.) Education - My undergrad performance could've been better. I did what so many do and decided I was smarter (haha) than my undergrad programs and took my learning into my own hands. I've done very little volunteer work. I've worked in the film industry post-graduation so industry experience won't really fly when applying. I want to go into a top tier program but I know realistically I will probably have to go into a lesser one for a Masters and leverage my way into a top tier program from that for a PhD (or whatever I end up pursuing)

2.) Goals: Yeah I know academic positions are hard (nearly impossible) to come by, I'm aware, but I would still love to throw my name into the cap upon graduation. Would love to teach and stay in academia for life. So I want to set a plan-of-action that doesn't eliminate that potential. But I also want to study in a way that sets me up for policy work. Applied research and potential to work in environments that could affect my topic.

Questions: 

1.) Does anybody know of, or can at least help guide me in the direction of, any programs (in the U.S. preferably) that deal directly with the topic in question.

2.) Should I focus on humanities programs. I'm so comfortable with Anthropology and anthros tenants of research that I'm inclined to look at programs in that realm but I know the value of a humanities degree in the US is dwindling.

Thanks for any help, and know that I am aware that I need to research more before making these decisions. I know it seems like my heads not straightened out, that because its not. That's what I'm currently doing, trying to create a plan of action that sets me up to get the most out of my education in the most realistic way possible.

Feel free to let me know anything, books to read, programs to research, academic advisors to email, volunteer opportunities to consider. I have nothing but the utmost appreciation for any help. 

Sorry for the long post! Thanks in advance.

What can I expect?,"**tl;dr: big baby can't handle two weeks of sleep deprivation, misses meeting with advisor, has another nervous breakdown, advisor was nice about it over email but I still feel like scum and don't know how I can dare to face her next week**


-


I'm an undergraduate junior at a mid-sized, elite U.S. university. Ever since the semester started (i.e. for the past two weeks), I've been running on five to six hours of sleep each night while taking 15 credit hours, reading for class, working as a research assistant, studying for the GRE (I'm applying to top PhD programs in a social science discipline), doing fieldwork for my senior honors thesis a year in advance, going to office hours, writing fellowship applications, getting ahead on readings, generally trying to be the best student in my major courses, etc. My aunt, who lives in a very distant and poor country, died during childbirth last month, adding to my stress. Yesterday, I made a huge mistake.


On Thursday night around 10:30 pm, my thesis advisor and I decided to meet for about 20 minutes before a class on Friday afternoon. Usually, I put every appointment in my Google Calendar, but out of sleep deprivation, I totally forgot. I know this is not an excuse for my behavior. On Friday morning, I studied for the GRE, worked and had lunch with the prof for whom I work, went to another prof's office hours, and then sat in a daze before class when I should have been meeting with my thesis advisor. 


After class, I was walking to the pharmacy when I got an email from my advisor. She wrote that she was expecting to see me but I wasn't outside of her office, but we can reschedule for next week. I started panicking and hurriedly wrote an email on my phone saying that I've been very sick for the past couple of weeks and bit off more than I could chew, completely forgetting about the meeting, I promise I won't do it again and that I'll schedule meetings on days when I have less going on and could we please reschedule for next week. Then I hid behind a wall so none of my classmates would see me, cried and had a panic attack for about 1.5 hours, and seriously considered committing suicide. (I should note here that I have suffered from anxiety since I was 12 and attempted suicide twice in middle and high school. My uni only lets students use its counseling services for a year, I've already been booted, and I don't have the time or money to see an off-campus provider.)


My advisor responded within half an hour telling me not to feel bad, and that she knew there must have been a good reason why I was missing – she knew I would never miss a meeting unless something seriously bad happened. She promised to follow up with me to reschedule for next week.


I'm not here to find a way to weasel my way out of this. I wasted her time, I blew it, I take full responsibility for my actions, and I'll accept any consequences without question. She may have been kind in her email, but that doesn't mean she won't chew me out in person. I don't expect her to continue being my advisor, and I expect my reputation at this uni to be irreparably ruined. I may have to withdraw from school and leave academia altogether because the shame is too much to bear. I don't know how I can show up at her office next week, say sorry again, and ask for forgiveness even though I don't deserve it.


I don't want to tell her about my mental health issues because I know there's no (public) crying in academia and I'm a 20-year-old adult who needs to suck it up like everyone else. It would be disrespectful of me to burden others – especially those ranked significantly above me – with my own problems. A year ago, the professor for whom I work managed to figure out that I'm mentally ill without my explicit disclosure, and I'm ashamed of myself every time I see him, so I don't want anyone else to know. I'm also ashamed of myself for not being able to handle a little sleep deprivation. Last academic year, I never got more than seven hours of sleep a night, hardly ever engaged in ""self-care"" beyond basic life maintenance, and had panic attacks once a month, but I still have a 3.8 cumulative and 4.0 major GPA with one co-authored conference paper and another on the way. I used to be able to bear all of it, and now I'm such a weakling. I'm afraid that I was right all along, that I'm not cut out for academia and my hubris finally caught up with me.",10,2016-09-17 15:41:34

5bs909,wayfaringstranger11,t2_12nhet,I'm worried that I chose the wrong field for pursuing my interests and not sure what to do next (Humanities: literature/modern languages/cultural studies),"TL;DR: Sorry for the wall of text.  My basic concern is that after a year and a half in my program I'm starting tohave the distinct feeling that I chose the wrong field or the wrong program for my research interests and am not sure what to do next.  Does anyone have tips for how to express these concerns (or whether I should at all) to the faculty in my department?

So I'm a second year PhD student in a modern language (we are small so I'm not going to say which in order to preserve my anonymity) and finding myself in a bit of an unexpected conundrum.  I'm not sure what steps to take and whether what I'm going through is normal.

Basically, I had a very rough first year of graduate school (relapse of mental health issues exacerbated by stress) and it took me a while to figure out why I was unhappy and which reasons were temporary/situational and which were more existential. I'm still trying to figure a lot of that out, but am slowly starting to realize that I may be in the wrong field or program for my research interests.

I came to my language very much from a cultural studies and linguistics standpoint.  Fell in love with the language and culture after a stint as an exchange student, studied it in college and excelled in the coursework.  While I did the literature/culture track of my major in undergrad, I came from a very interdisciplinary department at a SLAC and was sort of used to doing research that pulled not only from literary criticism, but also from history, cultural studies, and anthropology.  Mind you, this was undergrad, so I'm not claiming to have been an expert on any of these, but I would say that having the liberal arts background as well as the lengthy in-country experience when I first learned the language strongly informed my research interests.  I am still primarily interested in literature and certain other media, but I am more interested in how cultures interact with these texts.  My adviser in undergrad pushed me towards modern language programs and at the time I thought that was a great idea, as I had always envisioned myself at a SLAC where I could teach both the language and a range of courses on both literary and cultural topics (this is where my field seems to be headed, at least at smaller schools).

I chose a program that promised they encouraged interdisciplinary study for students who were interested in pursuing that.  They had some very interesting dissertations with methodologies that were close to the ones I'm drawn to.  However, I'm finding that the program is much more focused on straight-up literary criticism than I am used to and that, further, there is a certain amount of resistance from faculty towards any work that strays from the canon of dead white men.  There is also some resistance from some (not all) of the faculty towards applying certain other theoretical frameworks to literature (such as anthropology).  Other faculty have been more welcoming, but I'm finding that resistance is reflected for the most part in our group of graduate students as well.  It makes for a very insular culture that is far more concerned with literature as an aesthetic object than in any particular cultural implications for research on our language.  I'm wondering if I'm in the wrong program or possibly in the wrong field altogether. While I love literature (especially teaching it) i am finding it increasingly hard to picture myself studying literature and only literature for the rest of my life.  I'm starting to realize I may have been better suited to anthropology or cultural history and am finding this very frustrating.

I have no idea where to go from here or even how to express my concerns or who I can talk to about my research path.  Our program has an insane amount of coursework (3.5-4 years depending on individual schedules) and at the end of this year I'll only be halfway through (though assuming I pass exams, will at least have an MA).  I'm also sort of scared to admit to people that I'm not loving literary study as much as I thought...I've been told that many people with less traditional interests are much happier once they enter the last year of coursework and the dissertation writing phase, but given the high stress and toll on my mental health, I'm sort of scared to risk the unknown.

I don't have much undergrad coursework in history or anthropology and worry that if I am in the wrong field I would not be able to get into a program that would give me chances of getting a job at the end.  I'm currently in one of the best programs for job placement in my field and it's hard to justify giving that up.  

So now for my questions:  Is it possible for PhDs in modern languages/literatures departments to graduate and be successful on the job market with less traditional research interests?  How much of a student's success with such projects depends on faculty? How do I promote such projects to faculty that may not be 100% on board with the sorts of research methods that I'm looking into?  I have 2 supportive faculty members who have done this sort of research, but they are both sort of difficult advisors--one is terrible at keeping in touch wtih students and the other is kind of scattered/disengaged.  Is it ever possible for MA students to switch into different fields without having to start over? Are there any suggestions for if/how I should talk to professors and express that I'm having doubts about my place in this field?  

I'm very frustrated because I feel like they somewhat misrepresented the program to me and the other students don't seem to be encountering the same problems that I'm having because their interests fall more under the umbrella of traditional literary studies.  I'm sort of lacking any sort of mentor figure at the moment who I can talk to about doubts/concerns or really about my path in general.  We don't pick official advisors until the end of our third year when we start putting together our dissertation committee and the professor who has been working as the graduate student advisor since I've come is definitely one of the department's traditionalists and had a very strange knee jerk reaction when I tried to explain something from my (admittedly more liberal) minor field of study.  Just sort of stuck and not sure if there is a place for me in my field :(",10,2016-11-08 09:12:53
905pmu,Sassiopeia123,,I'm applying for a very prestigious graduate scholarship. Should I mention that I have schizophrenia?,"I don't really know where else to turn with this question. My mental health team didn't think I'd be able to finish high school let alone undergrad, so they don't believe in me for anything. My professors have never seen this kind of situation play out so they (all 2 people who know) really have no idea either. I have a meeting with the national coordinator for the scholarship tomorrow and I could ask her, but I also need her sponsorship to even go into the running, and I don't want to sabotage it.

We have to write a personal statement, and everywhere I look, it says to ""be yourself"" and ""talk about things that matter to you"" and ""tell us who you are"". A big part of who I am today is caught up in the illness that robbed me of my later teen years. I don't need it to explain away any poor grades or gaps in education, so I could leave it out and no one would know, but maybe my essay would be weaker. But then again, schizophrenia is highly stigmatised and I'll be labelling myself as a risky choice, and there's the risk that if I got accepted then my private diagnosis would become very, very public. 

I guess I'm wondering just how open-minded the scholarship committees really are.",10,2018-07-19 13:10:55

My GPA is only about a 3.0, and I've only had about 1-1.5 year's experience in research. (Also I should add, might not even count because 1- it was in Biology, not chemistry and 2- I basically disappeared from the lab due to overwhelming work commitments and mental health issues that I never resolved with the PI)

Because of all that, I feel like even if I rock the GRE, it won't matter much because I'll like need at least another year or two of real experience to prove to any admission committee that I'm worth it. (Addendum 2- I *do* have a plan for that ""bridge time"". without a full class load I'm very confident in my ability to work part time and do research in a lab to get me up to speed)

So, should I even bother with the GRE? I'm actually looking forward to the exam to see how I do, and I know I could always take it now and retake it later when I'm ready to apply, but I don't want to waste time/money that could be better spent getting me up to speed ASAP.

68mr2l,TheLittleVintage,t2_t7h9d,PhD research exacerbating mental health problems,"[Law/sociolegal/social sciences; UK]
 
I have been studying for my PhD for 7 months and while I have been really enjoying large parts of the research process,I'm finding that my research is exacerbating some pre-existing mental health conditions. The research that I'm doing is, in my opinion, pretty important. It's working with people whose voices are often ignored, silenced or dismissed within academic, political and public debates and who have become increasingly targeted by new sets of legislation here in the UK. My participants so far have been wonderful, and I would consider some of them even to be friends of mine. However, recently, the government has ramped up their attacks and has now passed some legislation that essentially will seriously uproot the lives of the people I'm working with. 

I find myself continuously feeling down when I think about it. I feel like the research I'm doing is pointless, like it's come too late and that it's not going to make a difference anyway now. I feel awful for the people I'm working with, who I have grown close to. I have an overwhelming sense of futility when I think about it, and while I don't feel my work necessarily lacks value, I do feel like I can no longer change anything as a result. I wanted to try and do something good with my work, which is now much harder for me to achieve. 

At the same time, I have the privilege to be able to step back and move away from the whole thing, which is not something the people I'm working with have. And that makes me feel even worse, like I shouldn't be complaining. At the end of the day, I can continue to live my life happily and comfortably; my identity and my livelihood will emerge intact regardless of what happens, and I should be feeling thankful for that, not depressed. 

I feel the work I'm doing is something that needs to be done, and I am lucky enough to be in a position to do it. But I don't know how to reconcile these thoughts. My supervisor is incredibly supportive, and I am seeking help from my university's counselling team. However, I was wondering if anyone else had any advice, experiences or support with similar situations that they would like to share. ",9,2017-05-01 15:49:47

dk60i0,letmediealready55,t2_4sx6jp8r,Math Professors - How do I ask for help?,"Hello, thank you for taking the time to read this.

I'm in a bit of an uncomfortable and disheartening situation and I'm looking for some advice on how best to proceed. This is a bit of a long read, so I'm sorry, but I'm feeling extremely, extremely discouraged and would like some honest input from capable individuals in the field. I would post to the professors sub, but I'm not certain they'd like another student invading their virtual lounge without invitation, so hopefully here will work? I really need some help.

Alright, so,

I'm currently a first-year undergraduate student in the math and physical sciences stream of my university (first-years do not yet have formal programs, but are instead in one of several streams of study, they apply to programs at the end of their first-year). 

My university experience has been a trying one thus far. I was admitted with a nice scholarship upon application and was supposed to have been a third-year student by now, but due to mental and physical health issues, I ended up taking an incomplete courseload my first official year, then having to take a leave of absence the second, and only now am I back, and still a first year. 

I'm now properly registered with the accessibility services at my school, and at their advice and that of academic advisors, am starting with a partial courseload to try to learn how to be a functioning student and individual (living on my own for the first time). And, really, until yesterday evening, I was doing pretty okay. My mental health is very much Not Good, and I'm waiting on specialists and doing things in the meantime to try to sort things out, but things are difficult. I have a lot of difficulty with executive functioning skills. Despite this, I am doing exceptionally well in my language course, and was doing well in my math course. Keyword being was. 

The math course that I'm in is the one designated for students who have an interest in math, but aren't certain they wish to pursue it, or are in the physical or computer sciences, or who may not have the necessary prerequisite knowledge/maturity to take the higher-level math course. Our first term test was yesterday, and it covered introductory logic, notation, quantifiers, formal limits, continuity, epsilon-delta proofs, and things of that sort. I did really well on the assignments prior to this test. They were a little challenging, but given time and the ability to ask questions, I performed very very well and thought I understood the material reasonably well. I've been going to office hours, speaking with my professor after lectures, and double-checking that my proofs are well-written and that my approaches are correct. My relationship with math has been difficult in the past, mostly because of the disappointing math curriculum and teaching standard where I live; students are taught to memorize and never question why or how things work and that led me to a lot of frustration. Despite never doing poorly in my math classes, I feel like my foundational math is not as solid as it could be, that I never really did as well as I could, and that maybe I still have some unresolved emotional issues there. But, for the first time, as I began this course and saw how capable and enthusiastic my instructors are, as I started to find the content interesting and even enjoyable (epsilon delta proofs are like satisfying little puzzle mini-games!) and doing well I began to think that maybe, just maybe, I could be good at this. Maybe I could be a math student. Maybe.

But then the term test came yesterday, and wow. I don't even know what to say. I did all the practice problems, reviewed all the videos, did the tutorials, clarified my questions, and thought things would hopefully be fine. All the signs suggested things would be fine. Then I started the test, and it may as well have been written in Inuktitut. I could hardly make sense of anything. I couldn't remember how to prove statements, how to reason through rough work. Determining limits of compositions from a graph?? How does that work? I honestly cannot tell you whether I failed that test or by some miracle pulled and 80 or something, and I don't know when we'll have our marks back. I don't even want to look at it when we do get it back. I feel physically ill about my performance on this test. 

I have to be honest and say that I'm not used to doing poorly, or to have any significant struggle understanding things. Courses like biology and chemistry and everything else have come easily and intuitively and despite having arguably one of the worst periods of my life at the time, I still managed to finish with above 95 in them. But math.... I feel so slow. So stupid. So abysmally stupid. Things don't come as quickly, in fact, they come quite slowly. Too slowly.  I did really well on the problem sets but now I'm just wondering if I faked my way into that, because apparently I don't understand that much at all, if that test was anything to go by. Maybe I'm incapable of doing things on my own.  I don't even know if it will be possible for me to finish with above a 90 in this course now (which, while I recognize that grades are not necessarily the most important qualifier or anything, I would like to pursue some form of graduate schooling so a decent academic record is preferable).

Just last week my professor was telling me they'd be happy to speak to me more about pursuing math, and now, I don't think I can even look them in the eye. I must seem so stupid. It's worth questioning whether I even belong in this course. I know that they say math is a discipline where hard work surpasses talent, but even then, I think natural aptitude is important to some degree, and I'm starting to question whether I actually have any. How can I even ask them for help when just last week I was dumb enough to admit I was just slightly considering math?

I'm tired of running away from my failures throughout the past couple of years though, so I really want the chance to repair this. If only out of stubbornness, I want the opportunity to conquer this material and understand it, to devour it until it becomes like breathing and maybe give math the chance I never truly gave it before. The chance I didn't give myself before. I intend to speak to my professor on Monday and ask for help or guidance, but I don't know how to go about doing so. What do I tell them? How much do I tell them? I feel like whatever potential I had when I was younger shriveled up and died the day my mental health decided it was time to mutate. I'm already a disappointment and I don't know whether to be honest about my past here. No one knows except the relevant counselors and advisors here and it's kind of isolating, but probably for the best? I really wanted to develop a good relationship with this professor, maybe impress them on some minute level, to not just be some random student sitting in the lecture hall. But really I'm scared that they'll think I'm actually, certifiably stupid. I'm still nervous to ask them questions when there is something I don't quite fully grasp, to answer their questions and be wrong. I thought about speaking to one of the other course professors instead, who I'm less nervous around (might be better so that I can actually ask questions??) but this is the one for my lecture section, and they're a very impressive individual and I want to learn everything I can from them. I just don't want to be stupid or a disappointment or annoyance.

So yeah. 

I might like math, I might not, I might not be adept at it, but I want the chance to be. Given my previous decent performance and likely disastrous test, how do I approach my professor who I'm kind of intimidated by? Just going up to them and being like ""Hi that test was a dumpster fire please take me under your wing and teach me everything you know"" is probably a bit much to dump on someone I've known for less than two months when I don't even know whether I should be studying math.

I'm really sorry this is so long, but I think I'm having a moderately-sized crisis so. 

Um, any suggestions?",8,2019-10-19 16:28:42

I am compiling a list of useful PhD related blogs and social media for a talk that I am giving in a few weeks. Do you have any recommendations?

This list is about coping with the PhD life and beyond (PhD mental health, academic job hunting etc.) , not about PhD subject related content like research methodology, science blogs etc. Feel free to shout-out your own accounts or pages if you do provide advice in this area.

Thank you very much in advance! Once I have this list compiled, I will find a way to get them uploaded on this thread so that other students can benefit too!",8,2019-05-22 14:10:02
99mw4r,Sanuuu,,Should I tell my supervisor I'm (passively) considering leaving the PhD course I'm only just starting?,"**Background:** Worked for a bit in industry (firmware) after graduating with a Masters. Last year I left the job for grad school - a 1+3 Masters+PhD programme. I've only just finished the Masters bit and about to enter the PhD part with a new supervisor I actively requested to transfer to.

**My feelings:** I'm not really interested in continuing the PhD programme. This is not a case of a mid-programme slump or anything that can possibly be worked out by a conversation with my supervisor. I'm only at the beginning and I already see that the kind of output that's expected out of people in academia is not for me, impacts my mental health negatively, and most importantly, I don't see myself having a passion for it. I'm interested in the subject matter and applications of the tech I'd be working with but don't see myself investigating the deep theoretical aspects of it.

**My current plans:** I'm in no rush to leave. I am planning to work for the PhD, as I would normally, but at the same time semi-actively be open to any opportunities of employment. As it stands a company in my area which I'm very interested in applying to.

**The dilemma:** I'm not sure if the intent to apply to jobs outside the course and subsequently leaving it is something I should communicate to my supervisor. On one hand doing so creates an awkward situation where they'd be aware of my lack of long-term plan to stick with the programme so they might as well stop wanting to work with me now. On the other hand, should I get a job, it's also awkward to drop an *""I'm leaving. BYE""* bombshell out of nowhere without letting giving your advisor a chance to, well, advise. Luckily funding is not a part of the conversation because I have external funding. Does Internet have any thoughts on this situation? ",8,2018-08-23 12:18:11
7zeymr,kaycomp,,Applying to a PhD with a poor undergraduate transcript (UK),"I had a lot of issues around my mental health and other problems during my undergraduate degree. As a result, I just about scraped a 2.1, and my transcript looks horrendous (I was originally on a 4 year course but had to downgrade at the last minute to avoid failing)

I went on to do a master's (thankfully I had an offer that was only conditional on me getting a 2.1). I was much healthier and got a distinction overall, as well as on every module. 

I'm now applying to PhDs and am worried that my terrible undergrad marks are going to follow me around and ruin my chances. Should I mention them at all in my personal statement, or should I just leave it? I have a good master's, a good proposal, and good references. Any advice would be greatly appreciated- I'm so annoyed with my past self, but think I have proven that I can do better and am ready for a PhD.",8,2018-02-22 13:44:06
5egtdy,JustAnotherCoder1337,t2_130kwk,Chances in academia with mental health issues,"I have been suffering from depressions, (only recently diagnosed) ADD and social anxiety for the last ten years. Even with psychotherapy and taking meds for most of the time, I had troubles to keep up with my bachelor and master studies in astrophysics, but finally finished last year after 18 semesters, with 13 semesters average to graduation at my university.

My main problems, during my studies was to regularly attend lectures and other events, procrastinating on projects, and most frustratingly, heavy mental fatigue after 3-4 hours of concentrated (and even enjoyable) work, that leaves me foggy feeling like shit for the rest of the day. While the first two might be solvable with therapy for ADD, I see no improvement for the later with my current meds. During the time I was writing my thesis I tended to avoid to go to my institute, to get at least some work done, and not ""waste"" time traveling.

Astrophysics is one of the only things that have motivate me to preserver, and I really want to work in the field. Also I think my skill set fits the well with the subject (I love coding simulations) but I just can't work as much as other people. With this I'm currently evaluating what my potential prospects are for working in science in the future. While I think I can get a PhD fellowship relatively easily, I'm worrying if I can produce as much output, as it might be expected. Esp. research funding seems to be focused on ""productive"" researchers, and I know of several in my eyes very good scientist, that struggle to find a permanent position.

Are there any resources that would enable me to work in the field? Are there any chances for half time positions, or positions with more flexible working hours after a PhD? I would also prefer to work in Germany in the long term, as I expect to need further (otherwise expensive) therapy and meds. Are there any programs here in particular?

Looking at resources of my own university and relevant research societies (mainly the Max Planck Institute), it seems that there is even less support for people struggling from mental health issues, than for physical handicaps, but do you know of anything that would help me?

c6gi64,ShellyLocke,t2_2x4a0vob,2 Questions I have about Gender Identity and Disability,"Hi everyone. To preface, I’m very new to learning about graduate school. Some personal conflicts made me unsure of whether I would continue undergrad, but this fall I’ll be going into my junior year with enough credits to keep my 4-year degree plan on track. I have a few questions about looking for grad schools. 


1. I’m a transgender woman in the first steps of my transition, and a queer-friendly environment is absolutely necessary to any school I plan to apply to. Is there a resource or method to most effectively determine the atmosphere of a school or department. 


2. Another concern I had was my status as a disabled student. I suffer from migraine headaches, as well as mental health issues and I receive accommodations from my university’s disability center. Are academic accommodations common among graduate students? Can I expect schools disability policies to be roughly the same, or do they vary from school to school?


Thank you in advance for any help. If this isn’t the right sub to post these on then I apologize for the inconvenience and take them somewhere more appropriate.",8,2019-06-28 05:57:56
ckzlbv,Dylanb993,t2_12j1ba3x,Scared to accept Teaching Fellowship in first year of masters.,"I’m starting the first year of my masters program in the Fall, and I’ve been offered a teaching fellowship that basically covers my tuition and a 5k stipend. 

This will be my first time moving out of my parents’ place and living on my own. Also moving to the opposite side of the country where I know no one and won’t have any friends or family nearby. 

My biggest concern is the time commitment and workload of the fellowship. It’s teaching 4, 2 hour labs a week. I’ve been told that it will take atleast double that in prep time to learn the material and get ready to present it. 

I’d really rather not subject myself to too much stress especially since it’s my first semester and I’ll have a full course load, and be going through some MASSIVE life changes while adjusting. 

Also, I’m going into industry and definitely do not want to be a professor/teacher, so the teaching experience in a classroom isn’t something I need, want, or would enjoy. 

Any advice and/or recommendations?

My mental health and enjoyment of this program are my priorities and I just want to make sure I stay happy and sane. 

Please let me know if I’m worrying too much or if I’m being reasonable. Is the financial help worth it in your opinion?

5ndlwe,jDawgLite,t2_inxc6,Where do you believe we should draw the line with academic freedom?,"Hello Reddit. My university recently started an anti-psychiatry scholarship, and I'm absolutely outraged. I can't understand how this can happen. We're affiliated with one of the largest mental health hospitals in the world (which is where I conduct my research) and it just seems like such a slap in the face to all the scientists devoting their lives to helping patients. 

Anyway, my question is - where do we draw the line with academic freedom? The university's rationale for allowing the scholarship is that all research should be allowed to be conducted, even if it's in line with unpopular opinions, provided the researchers are trying to positively contribute to society and their research has some foundation (I don't believe anti-psychiatry has any foundation, but that's not my point here so I'll leave it at that).",7,2017-01-11 17:50:10

I feel as though I've made a major mistake.  That I don't deserve to be here, they made a mistake hiring me, that I'm going to crash and burn.  

  
Its in a new country from both my home and my PhD.  So you would think I've done this ""moving countries"" thing before, I should be a pro at it.  But last time was a major disaster mental health wise.  And I can't help but think its going to be the same now.

w3qr7,Posthuman089,,Would I be Able to Get Accepted to Graduate School Given My Current Situation?,"Greetings, I was directed to this subreddit via nice fellow redditor and I have a coupled of questions concerning graduate school, a second BS degree or prospects for a career.

Let me begin with a bit of my personal background. In high school I excelled at math of all kinds getting top ranking scores on all the AP tests I took, going into college with what little guidance I had it was decided that I would major in math. After a while of taking college calculus, the snootiness and downright hurtful things engineering students would say to me deterred me from math/engineering degree path - at the time it felt like I didn't want to be associated with these kinds of folk(nothing personal, a bad experience on my part). I swapped majors 4 times and by the end of college I graduated with a BS in biochemistry(would have preferred chemistry but I just wanted out for several reasons). College was a challenging time for me, not because of financial issues but my mental health was deteriorating after a break up with my girlfriend, soon to be wife of 5 years. I learned that I had autism, bipolar, agoraphobia, social anxiety, substance abuse problems and stress related psychotic episodes. I never made a single friend at school despite trying to engage people, but I failed over and over. I was afraid to talk to my professors, the first time I went to my organic chemistry professor to discuss an exam he was literally screaming at some poor girl and I was mortified. I couldn't talk to anyone, I went into isolation, I had a mental breakdown, every time I went outside I had a panic attack. I managed to pull out of school with a 3.4 GPA but no references. I tried to get into research groups but I was denied on account of my junior status and funding issues. That is basically my back story leading up to a few questions.

Firstly, is it possible to get into grad school with such few references? Would a teacher whose class I did really well in vouch for me if I went back and told them this story or am I SOL? I would like to learn more about the biomarkers for mental illness and how receptors play a role in the development of the aforementioned if admitted to graduate school. Secondly, math and chemistry have always been my main interests, i'm thinking of pursuing a second BS in chemical engineering. I have applied to many jobs(100+) with only a few bites that told me I did not have the research experience/qualifications. I want a stable career and I want to do something I am passionate about, so I am thinking about this second BS. Are there Co-op programs for people in my situation who want to earn a degree yet still work? Are these available through school? Lastly, should I try to get a lab tech job right now to fill time and gain some experience? the only 2 jobs i've ever had were an arcade manager and a waiter. People treated me very cruelly and it is hard to get back into public without being terrified of being attacked/hurt emotionally. I'm just really lost right now, I know i'm in a very good situation in such a down economy, i'm just confused as to what the right move would be and if the move is even possible at this point in time. Thanks, sorry for the rant.",7,2012-07-06 00:20:10
ba0fju,sealsaregreat,t2_3jepfjrh,"My PhD advisor is so distanced from my research topic, I would go as far as to say he is willfully ignorant about it. What should I expect for my thesis defense? Is there any way I can make this less awkward/difficult/dangerous for me?","As you can guess, my relationship with my PhD advisor is not great. 

Things were rocky from the start, and I considered giving up a couple of times. I didn’t, and powered through my PhD research mostly on my own and with a network of collaborators and mentors. 

When it came to defining my research topic initially, my advisor never gave me any idea of what he wanted me to focus on, but disliked the general direction of what I suggested.
After more than six painful months of going nowhere, I defined a topic similar to what I had studied in my masters thesis, and got in touch with prospective collaborators that wanted to work on it with me. He seemed fairly happy with that, but directed me to work with more local collaborators, which I did.

My supervisor not only continued to refuse to give me any guidance towards a topic he was more familiar with, but also made zero effort in understanding how my specific field works. It is not so distant from what he does, but enough that it would take him some interest and reading to get what the field is about, and what are it’s main research questions. 

But his lack of interest is so, that every time I give a seminar, I feel like I am explaining to him what my whole field is about, instead of sharing my own results. I know it seems crazy, but at this point I feel like he willfully forgets what my research is about every couple of months. 

He is a co-author in one of my articles, and while all others provided me great insight and contributed significantly to improve the quality of the manuscript, his comments were mostly questions that could have been answered by a little bit of reading. 

To explain how this is possible: this is an interdisciplinary department, and most people don’t work with exactly the same theme as the PI. But this shouldn’t be an excuse, in my view. My masters supervisor also didn’t work in my field, but he became acquainted with it super fast, and together we managed to make a significant contribution to it by joining our expertise. In an interdisciplinary field like mine, this is usually a strength. But with my current supervisor, I feel like I am being dragged down. Needless to say, I struggled a lot and because of all of this I had a really hard time in terms of mental health during the whole process.


But things are going well now, I am publishing my work, and I feel like I am going to submit soon. 

But what should I expect from my defense? Does any of you have an experience with how this would look like in a panel, while I have to defend my work?

I am sorry if this is not well explained, I can provide answers in the comments. I don’t want this to be too easy to identify, but it is a bit of a very peculiar situation. Also, I am sorry if I sound utterly bitter... it’s because I am.",6,2019-04-06 03:49:32
iwdez,smartyskirt01,t2_4meag,Need help processing thoughts on grad school,"Here's my issue: I love studying. I feel such a sense of accomplishment when I take a class, master it, and walk away with an A or A+. I listen to podcasts HowStuffWorks.com put out every night before bed. I watch documentaries in my free time. Everything that I find fun involves some kind of learning: Wine/Beer/Scotch tasting, museums, speakers, cultural events. Things of that nature. Thus, I just assumed that I was going to continue ""all the way through"" to a PhD. But alas, I am finding that I dont feel I will be satisfied in the world of academia. I enjoy teaching (tutoring is a hobby of mine), giving workshops (internships), and research is...well...okay. I think I enjoy the idea of it more than I like actually doing it. However, I do feel that my good organizational skills will make me good at it. I'm doing an honors thesis (independent research) this year so we'll see how well I'll fair.

I really see myself using my knowledge acquisition drive to help others. Psychology as my chosen field, I thought I'd go into clinical psychology so I'd have a way to help people directly, while still teaching and doing research. But in my experience working at a behavioral health office and as a rape crisis counselor, I dont think I can handle working directly with people's emotions and mental functioning long term. I find myself more passionately drawn to people who function normally but need help organizing their lives for a specific project or something with an end point. Especially those in stigmatized communities, from which I come. In addition, my math skills indefatigably poor and, while I can take a class and master it, my retention skills for math is minimal at best. I've been studying math for a month because I'm planning to take the GRE in August and generally answer about 50% of the answers correctly. I score a bit higher on verbal.

I have a bit of money that was to be applied to college, but since I got a scholarship that covered my entire tuition, it's still available. But I'm at an impasse...WTF DO I DO NOW!?!?!?

8enoz9,bluegrayy,,Is a personal thank you letter from a student to a professor appropriate?,"I’m currently in a professional degree seeking program. This school year I have been dealing with some significant personal and mental health issues which have impacted many parts of my life, including school. I have many times felt that everything I was doing was a waste and I at one point lost purpose in pursuing my degree.

However, there is one class that I’m currently enrolled in which really affected me in a way I didn’t think it would. I never went to my professor’s office hours or really talked to her much, and my attendance in her class suffered a bit. But, the material she gave us, her insight when I was in class, and the open forum she provided in our class (it was a seminar, so we did plenty of talking amongst our classmates), really did something for me mentally and emotionally this past month. Her class essentially helped make me feel like I could have some purpose and be useful with my chosen career path.

I wanted to know whether it was appropriate for me to write her a letter during the summer explaining this and thanking her. I’ve been trying to thank every single person who has reached out to me or helped me, even in some minor way, the past year given everything that has been going on, so I’d like to thank her even though we didn’t really have a relationship minus me being in her class.

I would give it to her after final grades are submitted as I wouldn’t want her to think I’m trying to help out my grade or something.

I've been able to answer a high number of questions about the field by just scrolling around. Today I wanted to get your sense on something that's been eating at my soul little by little: I think I have wasted most of my time as an undergrad.

I started university in the fall of 2014 with the intention of graduating in 2018. Let's just say that that never happened. I had to take time off my sophomore year for mental health problems by dropping to of my four classes. I've been afraid to make the ""reality"" of my problems known to my professors for fear of the stigma. I went on to do the same thing in the fall of 2017. Then, I had a manic episode and had to withdraw from the spring semester of 2018. I proceeded to take the fall of as well. I'm *finally* back in class without major issues THIS fall.

**I essentially dropped one and a half years worth of units.**

Now that time is running out I realize that I've missed out on a lot of opportunities: I never ""networked"" with my professors. The ones I used to be close to either retired or left. One of the went to visit me in the psychiatric hospital when I was manic; I never took a cool internship nor had the desire to; I'm not exceptional or have grades perfect enough to pursue graduate studies (something I really want to do).

Considering I have at the most three semesters to go, what do you recommend that I do to take advantage of the time I have left?",6,2019-09-29 02:25:26

gl67hu,epsilonD3LT4,t2_60qcxil8,Very highly regarded (but also very abrasive) secondary PhD supervisor - how much should I involve him in my project?,"I'm  doing a PhD and I have two people listed down as my supervisors  for  the project, who I will call supervisors A and B. I get on really  well  with supervisor A, he makes constructive suggestions in a  constructive  way, and I always come out of meetings with him feeling  better about my  work. In many respects, I couldn't have asked for a  better supervisor  than A, and I feel I can be quite transparent about  how my work is  going with him (including discussing soft skills like  working  effectively from home during the lockdown, managing time and so  forth).  Supervisor B is several decades older, extremely well-regarded  in the  department, had numerous awards named after him and has made   significant contributions to his area from what I gather. Things have   panned out so far in such a way that I've seldom needed to meet   supervisor B in order to make progress with my work - technically he is   listed as a supervisor for my research project but it's more of a ""he   pops in when he's interested""-type arrangement.

However,  the main reason I prefer to stick with meeting supervisor A  is that I  often encounter supervisor B around in our department and he  has a way  with people which comes across as incredibly abrasive and  overly  critical, often casually undermining people in conversation,  asking  questions to people in a condescending way or even just making   unnecessary verbal ""snipes"" at people. He is infamous in the department   for this, and has supervised many of the academics when they were PhD   students, but it seems that nobody has pulled him up on his rudeness   because of his authority (when it comes to him supervising students) and   his academic reputation. Many anecdotes about him from his former   students have originated, for example, in reacting badly and   inappropriately to former students of his having children, going on   holiday or taking part in extracurricular activities during their   doctorates with him. These are normal things that people can expect to   do without being penalised by most (sane) supervisors. Supervisor B is   incredibly knowledgeable, and has some interesting stories to tell, but   is not an enjoyable person to be around and I try to avoid meeting him   unless I absolutely have to (once every couple of months versus once a   week with supervisor A).

However,  because of his reputation, people have alluded that a  reference letter  from supervisor B would be a golden ticket to get a  postdoc/industrial  position wherever I wanted, as he is an incredibly  well-established  name in his field. This leaves me torn as to whether I  want to involve  him much or not in the project. As far as I am aware,  not including him  in meetings regularly does not seem to be posing  supervisor B (or A)  any major issues, apart from a whinge on supervisor  B's part once or  twice which ended without any repercussions. If I did  involve him  regularly it would certainly benefit my career in getting  publications  with him and a recommendation letter from him in the end,  but being  supervised by him regularly would have a negative impact on my   confidence and mental health. I'm a mature student in my area (so I'm   rusty with some things), so I already lack confidence in my abilities   and could do without someone potentially making me feel worse.

Some  may diagree, but I feel that it is vital that a PhD supervisor  is  someone who you can establish a positive and professional working   rapport with. I think it's often an aspect of doing/choosing PhDs which   is often not talked about, despite PhD students effectively needing to   work with the same person for 3-4 years and there being many ""horror""   stories of students who have quit or failed as a result of clashes with   their supervisors. One of my former professors from during my undergrad   also told me that the rapport/personality of a supervisor is just as   important as the research area, if not more (although obviously there's   no use having a supervisor you get on really well with but whose   research area/interests don't line up with yours).

I'd  be interested to hear about any input on this - am I dodging a  bullet  here or simply shooting myself in the foot career-wise?

TL;DR:  I have two PhD supervisors, one of whom is brilliant and I see very  regularly, and my secondary supervisor (who I don't see very often) is  highly regarded in his field but also very abrasive and upleasant with  people including students he's formerly supervised. Not sure about whether to include the second one more often for potential career benefits.",6,2020-05-17 01:01:13
854v13,HumanDrinkingTea,,When did you decide you wanted to get a PhD and how did you prepare? Need some help with my path.,"I'm a non-traditional student (career changer) with a bachelors degree that's pretty much unrelated to anything I'm all that interested in studying. I've not been out of school too long (I'm 27), but I'm still old enough that I feel behind. 

Anyway, I'm taking a dive into getting a second bachelors degree. I came into it largely because I wanted to increase my career prospects (major in CS), but I find that I'm more drawn to the theoretical aspects of the subject and less drawn to the industry. I'm thinking of switching my major to computational mathematics and aiming to pursue a higher degree such as a PhD.

My problem is that I have a few concerns about this route. First is financial-- with a BS in CS, I can graduate and jump into the workforce right away. It's a ""safe"" choice. However, with my specific areas of interest, a higher level degree may be required before I can gain any useful employment. I am unsure how many years I can support myself in my academic endeavors.

This brings me to my next concern-- many people have suggested to me that perhaps I should pursue a purely academic career. I've been told that it is a good fit for my personality and that I have the aptitude/work ethic for it. However, from my outside perspective, the competition seems quite fierce. Although this route seems appealing to me, it seems to be setting off alarm bells in the ""risk aversion"" part of my brain. 

So you have an idea of how I am as a student: I have a spotty academic background, but a strong reputation among my professors as a good student. In high school and throughout my first degree I had an undiagnosed health issue as well as mental health issues that pulled my GPA down. I graduated with a 3.5 in an easy major, which isn't awful, I know, but I guess it lowered my confidence in myself a good bit. The upside is that in the classes I didn't bail on, I was typically the one of the top students in the class. This is at a medium tier state university, so not super competitive.

Now I'm a part-time student at a CC working on my core STEM courses (Calc, Physics, etc...). So far I have a 4.0 and I'm loving it *and* I've been told from some of the professors in the department that my Calc prof has been going around telling everyone what a great student I am. I'm honored (to say the least) that he'd feel compelled to do that, and I appreciate that other professors (who I haven't taken) seem happy to get to know me, but I worry that this is leading the department to overestimate my potential when it comes to succeeding in academia. They are very encouraging, but I don't buy it when my adviser says I shouldn't have too much of a problem gaining admittance into a PhD program (down the road)-- remember I'm at a CC and early in my (new) career path. It will also take a while because I'm only attending part-time. 

I have some specific interests that I'd like to explore, but my knowledge in those arenas is extremely limited. I have strong interests in machine learning, data science, and computational neuroscience. I am unsure how I would going about exploring these fields further, and I am similarly unsure how I would go about getting involved in the sort of research that would prepare me for an post-grad degree. 

Because this post is getting too long, I'll stop here. I'm hoping you all can help me figure out if a PhD route is a realistic option for me and if you can help me figure out how I'd go about reaching this goal. Of course, as per the title, I also want to know how YOU started on your path to a PhD and what it took to get there. I'm open to advice, stories, or really just anything that will help me feel a little bit less lost and inadequate in my journey.

chlkug,PdotH,t2_162p8m,Starting my PhD soon. Any advice?,"Hi!

I just finished my MA studies and I'll start my PhD in September (full time, Social Sciences, EU). So I'm basically free for a month.

But how to go about starting a doctorate? Should I prepare by doing some reading? In your experience, are there any must-have gadgets that will facilitate my daily PhD life (productivity / organization apps, equipment for my office setup, etc.)?

One thing I've learnt in my BA and MA studies is not to compare myself to others as far as time management, productivity, and learning strategies are concerned, I'm still curious though: how long do you usually work? Typical 9-5? Work on weekends? And how do you take care of your mental health (does it really take that big of a toll on PhD students?)?

Since I'll have the time, I was thinking about cleaning up some things in my MA dissertation in hopes of being able to publish a chapter. Publications really seem to be the currency of academia and I don't know if I'll ever be able to get back to that once my PhD starts, so might be a good time to try now.

Appreciate your replies :)",6,2019-07-25 09:47:47

1p15yt,[deleted],,How to deal with bullying by the advisor?,"I'm a third year Ph.D. student looking for concrete advice on dealing with this situation:

My advisor is a known researcher in my STEM field and has collaborations across the globe. He travels a **lot** (he spends somewhere around jet-lagged days every month at the home institute). Because of his many administrative roles and large group, all of his students get very little time to interact with him. In that limited interaction time, he is not receptive and is extremely critical of the students.

A major chunk of my meeting time with him is spent in him criticizing my presentation (grammar, diction, volume, sentence structure) rather than the ideas themselves. Since he works on many problems at once, across the various collaborations he has, he does not understand the details and is not receptive to any corrections to his misunderstanding. Hence, it takes a lot of time, effort and patience to communicate the idea and obtain useful feedback and direction.

One of my colleagues, a grad student with the same advisor, attempted suicide last month and has been undergoing therapy since then. Another student committed suicide around six years ago. I understand that mental health issues are prevalent in grad school but think that the stress of having an antagonizing advisor might have contributed to these unfortunate events.

I stay reasonably strong in the face of this stress, but would like to figure out how to deal with such an advisor and get maximum work output from my interaction with him.

4mg0g7,microbeeologist,t2_q5egs,Is this a normal research lab environment?,"The past 2 years I have worked within my research lab as a research assistant. Also since then, I have been the sole care taker of a family member, and also worked part time and on the weekends. When I was first starting out, I asked a lot of questions, but then missed 2 weeks of presently being at the lab, and I feel like I missed out on the initial bonding with my labmates. We are all in the same undergrad year, and we have taken a lot of classes together.

I have always worked hard, and produced results. It's to the point where I have presented posters at over 5 local conferences, and given 2 oral presentations about my project. The first project I worked on is currently a paper in review for publication in a peer reviewed journal. However, I have always felt a little behind when compared to my labmates. They don't have as many personal responsibilities as I do, and they do great work. So when I have doubts, I go to them to ask questions, but they just shrug me off. They tell me they don't know the answers, but when another person asks the same question, they suddenly have an answer(this happened once, 5 min after I asked the same exact question..). When doing bench work, I always offer help, but no one asks me to help out. The next day my PI texts me asking me to offer to help with bench work. 

Since our PI is usually out of the lab writing and applying to grants, I just dedicated time to looking online/read papers for answers. This in turn, takes time off my hands to actually dedicate to quickly produced results. I get scolded, I get told my results are ""too raw"", but I feel like maybe I haven't been explained properly what needs to be done. When I ask for clarification, I get cryptic responses. (""You need to think more"";""Try to digest the results"";""Figure x doesn't make any sense."")


I have actively tried reaching out to each labmate individually to offer help/ask questions/just say hi, nothing changes. Last year I worked at the biology department, and my co-workers told me it wasn't me, it's that the environment in that lab was toxic(they all know my labmates and my PI). My past boss was concerned that this was affecting my mental health, especially with all the responsibilities I juggle while doing research 15+ hours a week. 


I graduate from my undergrad soon, but I just want to quit and leave the lab. I don't feel appreciated, nor like I contribute to anything. Is this the kind of environment that is normal for research labs? Any insight would be great. 

Crap like this makes me re-think my choice to do research in the future.",6,2016-06-04 00:49:49

I've tried saying that I have a commitment, however they press for what the commitment is. I try to keep my mental health issues private.

64z5ju,FedorianGray,t2_10qm5t,Institutional Research-What is the work like?,"Some background info- I hold a MS in Mental Health Counseling. All of my internship and professional experience has been in higher ed, working directly with college students. I recently experienced an ""awakening"" of sorts, and am looking to pursue my original career interest: research. To that end, I am pursuing another graduate degree in ed psych with a heavy focus on quantitative methods and statistics. 

I am currently working in higher ed as a student support specialist. I work primarily with students on academic probation. I do not mind the work, but I would definitely like to find work that allows me to conduct research and work with data. I do enjoy working in higher ed, and I would like to stay in this field if possible. I figure that institutional research may be a good fit for me, as I would still be working in academia, but I would be doing things that fit more with my goals and interests.  

So, my fine friends, are there any among you who work in institutional research? If so, could you please share with me some of the typical characteristics of the job? What does a normal day look like for you? What are some of your day-to-day tasks? What about it do you find rewarding? What do you find challenging? I would greatly appreciate any and all information that you could provide to me. 

Also, what kind of education/background/skills are essential to securing a position in institutional research? I suppose working in higher ed and having teaching experience are both things I have working in my favor, but unfortunately my education has given me very few research skills thus far (hence the second degree). Again, anything you can tell me about how to prepare myself for this type of career would be helpful.

6aw7fh,internthrowaway3000,,How to Admit a Lie to new PI,"I am spending the next few months doing a research internship at an institution separate from my undergrad. My PI is an awesome guy and I'm really honored to work with him and hopefully make connections and be able to return to his lab after I graduate this coming year. 

However, I lied during my phone interview with him. He asked if I had attended any other school, because there was a gap in my transcripts between my high school graduation and my current undergrad. I told him no and said I spent that time working. I did have a job right out of HS but I also did attend a different college. I flunked out after an unsuccessful suicide attempt that left me floundering academically and socially. The campus counselers were incredibly unsupportive and I lost my scholarship due to bad grades halfway through a semester, leaving me on the hook for thousands of dollars of tuition. I've been paying them back every month since (this was 5+ years ago) and I still haven't settled the balance in full so I don't have access to my transcripts. (I have confirmed this with my old school and they will not budge on the transcripts.)

How do I bring this up? I didn't lie intentionally on the phone, I just panicked because every time I get asked about my nontraditional college timeline I have flashbacks to a very dark time in my life. But since I omitted it in my application to work there that also looks bad. I feel awful and I have been anxious for months but I'm wondering if I even should tell him now and how to do it. The internship starts in three weeks and I'm worried he will not want me to work there anymore and won't trust me. I am in a much better place now and I also don't want him to think I still have serious mental health problems - I went to therapy and everything and I am not clinically depressed anymore.

Any advice would be appreciated. ",5,2017-05-13 05:06:21

I need to meet with the undergraduate program director to get approval and a signature before I can officially add the second major.

The problem is I have social anxiety and I'm terrified of meeting with the program director. She has a reputation for being nasty and rude, but I took a class with her once and she isn't really; she is just direct and doesn't take crap from anyone. I wouldn't be nervous if this was just a normal advisor, but she is very accomplished and I admire her a lot.

I don't know how to explain why I'm taking so long to graduate, why I didn't add the major until now, what my career goals are, why I never came for advising on class selection and why my grades are mediocre (mostly B's and B+'s). All of the answers boil down to my mental health issues, which isn't exactly something I want to use to explain myself. I'm afraid of embarrassing myself and not knowing what to say. It's so bad that I'm considering not even adding the second major, even though I have all the requirements done and it is a way more employable major. 

Has anyone else been in this situation? Does anyone have any advice? I know this sounds ridiculous to people without social anxiety. Just knowing how a conversation like this usually goes would be helpful. Thanks!",5,2014-01-23 06:15:45

c21cn5,stringyfellow,t2_hes27,Advice on difficult PhD working environment,"I'm posting on here looking for some advice/encouragement, and also to vent a bit about my PhD experience so far.

I am just over 3 years into a PhD programme that is supposed to be 4 years but could take up to 5. Two major reasons that I joined the group I am working in is that the group is part of a larger research node working on similar stuff at the same university, and the group had developed a novel technique that looked interesting to me (not going into detail in the interests of anonymity). After arriving, it turned out that the benefits of both of these things had been fairly dramatically oversold. Firstly, my supervisor views the other groups working in the research node as competitors, and collaboration (or even scientific discussion) with the people I pass most days in the hallway is strongly discouraged. Secondly, the reliability of the novel technique turned out to have been oversold quite a bit, to the point where a significant portion of research time is just spent repeating the process. These reasons were the initial seeds of my discomfort in the research group, however the working culture is also fairly brutal, with what I view as a counter-productive amount of pressure for results, and little value for the active development of PhD students as researchers. The ethos is very much do things over and over again until they work, and taking the time to understand why they didn't work the first time is seen as unproductive. My supervisor is not abusive or anything, however they can be quite callous in the way that they treat their students and postdocs (as an example, recently a junior PhD student was sent to a fairly prestigious conference to present the results of a more senior PhD student. The senior PhD student wanted to go and it would have been good for their career, however they were not allowed to as it would have required them taking time out of the lab where they were generating nice results). It is also a fairly large group with a very narrow research focus, which means that they different projects people are working on have significant overlap. At one point three separate people where working competitively towards the same result. This creates an environment in which people are very cautious sharing ideas, and secrecy and politicking is common.

I have tried to raise some of my concerns and suggest improvements to my supervisor a couple of times, and on each occasion so far have been treated like my concerns were unreasonable. I disagree with this, as multiple people in the group feel the same way.

I have fairly seriously considered quitting multiple times so far, either leaving academia altogether or trying to move to a different group. I am now at the point where I have some ok results, some days the end is kind of in sight, but a few years of chronic stress is starting to take a toll on my mental health. I'm feeling pretty burned out, and I worry that if I keep pushing I might end up doing some lasting damage to my mental health. I know that psychological stress is to some extent par for the course in a PhD, but all the dysfunctional group dynamics layered on top of the usual PhD stuff feels like a bit much.

Does anybody have any suggestions or tips, things which helped them get through a tough time in their PhD? They would be much appreciated",5,2019-06-18 11:58:05

I also don't want to be an accountant.  I find that most of the jobs that I qualify for are in large cities, and I really dislike large cities.  I want to live in a very cloudy/overcast small to mid-sized city.  My dream is to move to Bellingham, WA because they only average 35% sunshine.  I am also very involved in dog rescue and moving there would allow me to foster senior dogs with Old Dog Haven.

I have thought a lot about what I would like to do and what I would be good at doing while getting to live in a place that I like.  I have three options in front of me.  Are any of them sound?  What do you think?

Option #1:  M.A. in Communication Studies from Texas State University.  I would likely be able to get a graduate instructor assistant position based on my email conversation with the department head.  That would pay for my tuition with a little left over.  After graduation, try to teach at a community college.

Option #2:  Academic Advising Certification completed online from a state university.  It is a graduate-level certification that I could complete by December.  After that, try to get a position as an Academic Advisor at a community college.  (I would have the option to extend this into a M.Ed. in Student Development &amp; Leadership in Higher Education of I choose).  I would pay out of pocket for tuition, but my husband makes a decent amount to cover us for a little bit.

Option #3:  Get a state teaching certification and try to teach business courses (particularly Accounting) at the high school level.  I have been considering this to be the least desirable option because I hear bad things about first-year teachers quickly burning out and leaving.

I am really struggling with what to do and any input would be very much appreciated.  Thanks!",4,2016-05-04 17:44:05
bpj6l1,tigermilk96,t2_bbcqf,Wondering if PhD in Clinical Psychology is viable for me (LCSW) / getting research experience after grad school,"Hello! I’m curious to hear about 1. Thoughts on strengthening chances of getting in a PhD psych program and 2. Completing a PhD with “life” stuff.

Current situation:
- Graduated MSW in 2014 (undergrad GPA 3.8, grad GPA 3.67). Licensed in California in 2017.
- Management and clinical experience (severe/persistent mental illness; community mental health).
- Pretty confident about letters of recommendation and writing skills for personal statement.
- Last took GRE almost 10 years ago without studying (4-5 writing and ~155 on verbal/quant; would study to try to bring up to ~160-165)
- Assisted in qualitative research for 1 semester during MSW program; not published.

I already love teaching but also know I would love to conduct research more seriously. I am concerned that this lack of research experience would be my biggest downfall in applying to competitive schools. I have tried to look for opportunities to volunteer my time to assist in labs but most things I have found locally seem to be for undergrads or grad students. I have considered emailing multiple local faculty members but not sure if this is the right way to approach it. **What options or strategies should I pursue to look for research experience?**

I am trying to stay in Southern California for family, however I also want to work into influential T1 research institutions. I am currently interested in UCLA, USC, or Berkeley. If these don’t seem realistic, I would be open to out of state then but not sure how that would work with family life...

Moreover, I am also somewhat concerned about investing 6 years into a degree while I am still trying to save up for a house (in expensive California...) and possibly have a child in a couple of years. It seems like many of my past professors say it’s very doable but it’s not easy lol. Just wondering what your stories might be.",4,2019-05-16 22:35:43
bzw9yf,Caithmmir,t2_qm9qgu3,Am I making a big mistake?,"I've been accepted onto a PhD program in mathematics here in the UK, but I'm worried I'm making a big mistake by accepting it. I finished my undergrad a year ago, and I decided not to go straight into a MS/PhD program because A) I was burnt out and I was suffering from mental health issues, and B) I was very unsure of what I wanted to do, so I didn't want to jump into a big commitment like that.

However, over the last year I've done very little, which hasn't helped my mental well-being. I worked in a financial role for a couple of months, but I hated it and left after I was recently offered a PhD at my old university. But now I'm worried I accepted it impulsively as a way to get out of my job and to make sure I'm doing something, otherwise I'm scared I would fall into a pit of depressed inertia and end up doing nothing for months or even years.

I'm already in my mid-twenties, and I've been advised by PhD graduates to do it as soon as possible while I'm still young and don't have too many commitments, plus while I'm not tempted away by higher paying jobs.

The pros of the PhD program are:

1. It's well within my ability, so I know I will be able to complete (i.e. it's a safe option).
2. I was accepted onto it without a Master's, even though the min requirement was an MS (in the UK a lot of PhD programs require an MS, and even programs that officially don't require one still in practice only accept applicants with MS's, but the supervisor already knew me so they bypassed that). I doubt I'd get this opportunity again.
3. I know the area quite well, and I already have a social network there.
4. The area is pretty cheap, so I can afford to live pretty comfortably in a one-bedroom apartment (I'm pretty introverted, so I need to get away from people at the end of the day).
5. I already know the supervisor and get on with them pretty well.
6. It'll mean I'll only be in my late twenties by the time I finish, rather than being 30+ by the time I finish if I do a MS first and then do a 3/4-year PhD program at a higher-ranked school.

The cons are:

1. I already spent 4 years there, so I may feel bored, trapped or missing out if I stay there for another 2.5 years (I'll probably live elsewhere while writing up my thesis). It's a pretty small town, so there's not much going on outside the university.
2. The university's research ranking for mathematics isn't very high (it's not even in the top 30 for research quality in the UK). I've been told that the subject/research ranking of the university doesn't matter as much as your supervisor and their LoR, and after 5 years no one cares where you went. But I've also been told that there is an unspoken preference for higher-ranked schools in academia. Also, while no one may care about where you went years down the line, going to these schools may give you better access to academic connections in the first place, which propels your career forward while everyone else is left with the scraps. I've also heard that industry cares where you went to an extent, although the quality of your work is more important. I'm interested in working in the US in the future, so this might turn out to be a massive barrier.
3. I'm worried I'm not reaching my full potential. I have the grades for more 'prestigious' universities like Cambridge, Oxford, Ivy League in US, etc. (I got 85%+, which is equivalent of a 4.0 GPA), though this would mean I wouldn't finish until my early 30's if I went down these routes.

Am I making a mistake by accepting this? I doubt I would get onto a program like this again without doing a Master's first, so should I just accept the safe option? Or would it be better in the long run to do a MS first, then get onto a program at a higher-ranked university?

Thanks in advance.",4,2019-06-12 20:27:38

As a result, I ended up doing two coursework subjects this semester, and deferring the thesis until next semester. My plan was to continue working 20h a week, and next semester do my compulsory research methods subject and the first thesis subject (3/4 full-time study load). 

However, my current assessment of the situation is that, although my mental health is a lot better than last year, it would be a bad idea for me to try to work and do more than 1/2 of a full-time load. Without going into details, I still feel that I barely coped last semester (with 20h work and 1/2 full-time study), had a lot of panic attacks which were exhausting and generally high anxiety. I'm on the waiting list for public health mental healthcare (which I was previously accessing; ended up back on wait list due to moving cities). Also my grades, though I have only gotten one back, have not been that good, which is unusual for me (even very bad mental health hasn't typically affected my grades). 

As the thesis subject itself is 1/2 full-time, and I need to do the research methods subject before or during it, and the research methods subject is only offered this semester, my only options are:

a. Attempt to do that much study and work, or
b. Do the research methods subject and another coursework subject (total 1/2 full-time) and then do my thesis next year (1/2 full-time each semester).

I'd prefer to do the latter, as given my mental health issues I think a cautious approach to workload is better. However, unfortunately I'm worried that my supervisor might be upset at me, as:

a. I have already changed when I want to start my thesis once, so I'm worried it could be affecting her plans.
b. During May (when I was starting this new job, having a lot of panic attacks at work, and also volunteering on an election campaign) I accidentally didn't reply to her emails twice - - once because I genuinely missed an email and didn't reply for like three weeks, and once because I just completely forgot I hadn't replied and only realized 8 days later when she hadn't replied back to me. I feel especially bad about this as she was trying to arrange for me to meet an MA student she is also supervising, as our field is tiny so I'm the only Honours student in this specific major. Now she isn't responding to MY emails (for two weeks so far) and I tried to call her yesterday but she didn't pick up. 

Anyway, basically I feel terrible as I have accidentally ghosted my poor supervisor and feel terrible about it, and now I want to ask if I can change my plans for when I start my thesis, which I am worried will stuff up her plans, and I'm too scared to even raise the issue, especially as she seems upset at me as she currently isn't replying.

Does anyone know how to approach this issue? Based on my own view of my mental health, I would be extremely concerned if I started next semester doing 3/4 full-time study (including starting a thesis) and working. Cutting down on work hours isn't an option as I am supporting myself (as I've graduated from pre-Honours undergrad, I've been ridiculously lucky in getting this decent paying job with steady hours, which may be why the job is making me nervous as I always feel like I'm not doing well enough and have panic attacks during meetings).

hu8hnh,bi_scotti,t2_2bov4cva,How to approach PI properly about mental health issues?,"Hi all, 

I’m a second year grad student in STEM and before I started grad school and into the first year, I was the target of emotional workplace abuse by a former coworker (still in my same department). It went beyond the standard belittling, isolating, spreading rumors, ostracizing and dipped into low key stalking and threats of suicide territory. 

Needless it say it’s really fucked with me. It’s taken me two years since it started to begin therapy (gaslighting really made me believe it wasn’t that bad/ my fault), but I’ve been making progress over the past couple months thanks to sessions around 2x per week and a low dose of SSRIs. The school psychiatrist thinks I have PTSD. 

It’s been bad enough to have an effect on my performance, though I’m just emerging from the cloud of chaos in my mind to see that objectively. I’m having some trouble paying attention to things sometimes or remembering things I should, I’m also always doubting myself. 

Although I was trying to be transparent with this to my PI (telling him vaguely what happened and that I was starting in SSRIs in case it affected me adversely for the adjustment period), I’m worried I wasn’t clear enough. On Friday he pulled me into his office after a practice presentation for my qualifying exam clearly frustrated that I didn’t seem on my game, that I couldn’t answer biological pathway questions I should know, just essentially making me feel awful and stupid. Not to say his frustration wasn’t valid, but I had really tried to preface my practice presentation by saying that I hadn’t had a chance to review all the background information yet (it’s still weeks until I have to do the official defense). 

I heard his frustration and told him I was sorry I disappointed him. I tried to explain more about how trauma can mess with your memory and that I was actively trying to address it with the help of the graduate school. I also tried to explain a bit more about how awful the situation was without being too dramatic about it. The last think I want is to emotionally manipulate someone into feeling bad for me. 

So my question is, is there a better way I could have gone about this? Is there a way for me to check in with him about my progress that might make things clearer for him? He is not a bad or mean person but is a member of the generations that seem to have less regard for getting professional mental help and more of the  “suck it up” attitude. I know I’m capable of doing good work and have the record to prove it, but this is something I have to address proactively in order to get back to my sharp productive self. 

Thanks for reading and any advice is appreciated.",4,2020-07-19 21:25:04
5bofwq,one_and_done90,t2_12ntp2,To finish my Master's/actual value of a masters degree,"So over the last year and half I've been working on a fully funded Master's degree in a highly specialized field of economics. Starting during my second semester I've been fairly miserable with a lack of interest in the field I'm studying, realizing I don't want to work in data analysis/economics as a career, and a large decline in my physical and mental health(gained close to 100lbs in under a year+had to see several doctors for sleeping issues/stress)

I'm also highly concerned about the actual value of this degree, there's only been one course in my curriculum that's been only graduate students, all the others out of the 30 credit hours have been mixed with undergrads and no special requirement/projects for the grad students. On top of this I feel like I haven't really obtained any skills that are really relevant towards a career even if I did want to go in economics, for example the program only goes into introductory econometrics but that's it. 

Now I'm having trouble trying to justify creating a thesis and finishing the next semester of classes since it really hasn't improved my career prospects all that much based on my job searching/hunting. I've talked to a couple professors I'm on good terms with along with family members and gotten a wide variety of opinions on what my next steps should be. I figure why not get the advice of the internet while I'm at it! 

I do have to admit that the only reason I went to this program was due to a lack of full time work and that they offered me a stipend",4,2016-11-07 20:03:07

6oxcbb,changeitifyouhateit,t2_an6ni,"Needing some perspective - is it plausible for me to ""redo"" college?","I apologize for the wall of text, but I feel it is important I provide full context. I want to make sure I am making the right decision. 

First, some background:

I grew up in a rural community and did very well in high school (high SAT scores, 4.0 GPA, numerous community leadership roles, etc). Not sure what I wanted to do career-wise, I questioned if I should jump into college right away. Due to an immediate scholarship/grant opportunity and the advice of family and friends, I decided to go to a great engineering school to study mechanical engineering (great career prospects with only 4 years of education).

My first year, all was fine academically. However, without any defined goals or passion for engineering there was a severe lack of motivation. My academic effort and performance eventually plummeted causing an unexpected decline in my mental and physical health. I temporarily dropped out of school without telling family. 

To save face and finish school with a degree/job, I immediately went back and switched my degree to accounting (again, great career prospects). Not having solved the initial dilemma I faced with engineering, the same cycle continued with accounting. After an extensive internship, I was offered a full-time position but realized an accounting career was far from what I wanted to do with my life. With mounting student loans and no motivation, I made the scary decision to end the downward spiral and leave school with 2 semesters left. 

That was 2 years ago. Although it was tough for family/friends to understand my decision and I am not better off financially for it, I feel confident it was the right thing for me. I am now much happier and in a MUCH better place mentally. I have been able to look back and see with clarity how I ended up making the mistakes I made, and I learned a lot about myself in the process. With a clearer understanding of my passions and motivations, I am now considering “redoing” my undergraduate experience, but I need to know if I am being realistic, hence, this post.

All my life I have had a passion for science. As a young kid, I remember saving all my money from mowing lawns and babysitting to get that next science book. That excitement never left and today I still spend part of everyday skimming a textbook, reading a publication, or watching lectures. Because it has been a consistent passion since I was little and I have had the time to look into the lifestyle it involves, I want to eventually do research in oceanography, more specifically, paleoceanography. However, this would entail getting a B.S. in a geoscience field and getting accepted into an oceanography PhD program. I have a good idea of the workload involved and the sacrifices that need to be made in order to pursue this, and I feel it’s the right path for me. 

My question:

The fear is that I go back to school and work my ass off for 4 years to no avail. Given my ugly college record, is it plausible that I could go after an entirely new career in research; would top school graduate admissions be able to overlook my past (two-time college drop out with poor transcript) if I were able to do well going forward (high GPA, research experience, networking, etc.)?

I'm currently a full-time master's student (in the humanities) at an Ivy League university, but I've found myself having serious doubts about joining the academia after one year in my program.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm probably just being naive, but my whole experience, so far, has been completely soul-less and soul-crushing. The work was difficult, as expected, but it took up so much of my energy that my mental health and social life suffered. I find the people to be arrogant and uppity, and most conversations end up being about who is the smartest person in the room. There's this constant pressure to be doing something important, whether it's sucking up to a professor or writing a paper for submission to a conference or journal. I honestly don't know if I can survive in the academia, and I don't know if it's because I'm lazy, or if it's because I made the wrong decision. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm supposed to apply to Ph.D. programs in the fall, but the thought of having to re-take the GRE (I've never been one for standardized tests, so I wanted to try for a better score - as an aside, I find it to be a complete insult to my intelligence, and the intelligence of anyone who has managed to make it to a master's program), write a statement of purpose, fine-tune my writing sample, and God knows what else all over again honestly makes me want to fling myself off a building. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I loved my field, and I think I do, but maybe it was a mistake to turn something I love into a career. Now, it just feels like a burden and a chore, and I have no idea what to do. I see my peers reading books and articles in their free time, expanding their knowledge, but I can't find the motivation to do any of that. I'm not sure if I should stick it out, at the risk of being miserable, or try to get out now. It's difficult to find jobs outside the academia in my chosen field, so I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. I've committed to one more year of study, and I think I would like to at least finish my degree, but I have no idea what to do from here.

&amp;#x200B;

gza24h,dinosaurlaw,t2_6pipv54y,Wannabe Humanities Academic is Really a Lawyer. Please Advise.,"Academic redditors, I'm badly in need of some advice. I have tried to make the following concise, but Tbh it's a rant. Bless you if you read this and thank you for whatever time you spend treading into the semi-sinkhole of the last six years of my life. And I'm so sorry if this is not the right thread. 

Background: 

I, (29, F, USA) , graduated from a big state research school in 2014 with degrees in English and Film (stunning pragmatism). I applied to PhD's in English. My interests were drama and film/ critical theory.  

 I got into UNC, Tufts, and a handful of partially-funded masters. 

My boyfriend, who was also enrolled in a PhD program, and I worried about our relationship long-term if we both eventually miraculously succeeded on the academic job market. In a move that now makes me super-cringe for de-prioritizing my own goals, I panicked, applied to law school, got into a top 15 school, and decided to go.  

Essentially:  Yes, it was a phenomenally dumb reason to go to law school. No, I shouldn't have done it. Yes, I should have dropped out of law school. No, I didn't. Yes, I super-hated the next three years. 

Law school has, in so many ways, a reverse-mentality from academia. The goal is to 1. teach students the law and 2. teach students how to apply the law to the case at hand.  Anything outside the purview of those goals (for example, considering the historical or cultural context of a law) is simply not relevant. 

In law school, I found out that our legal system that has eroded fundamental rights, made corporations powerful beyond belief, and applies wildly inconsistent standards depending where you are in the country. None of my professors discussed how we got the current system, the role of our two-party system in the creation of these legal systems, or the ways in which legal policy might or should change. Not getting those questions answered in the law school, I  started taking cross-listed classes in public policy.

Through my work there, I found a passion for prison policy reform. I was able to visit prisons and juvenile centers in my state and learn about the ways that they are run and the human rights abuses that consistently take place within them.  

I studied abroad in Ireland and took graduate criminology classes.  I was bowled over with how interesting it all was. They were looking at the cultural and historical context of laws and policy across Europe. I got to visit Irish prisons and talk to some of the corrections officers and the people incarcerated there.  

I got back to the USA and watched the legislative session. I volunteered at a nonprofit doing prison reform work. Conservatives had suddenly started passing criminal reform bills after three decades of being ""tough-on-crime."" I started wondering about the ideological shifts that had occurred since 9/11 that allowed that to happen. 

I started to think about issues of prison visibility and representation in the media. Prisons and prisoners are shielded from view by walls and hidden away in rural parts of the state. I wondered how much your average American knew about prisons and how much media representations--fictional and nonfiction--influenced their views. 

I graduated and started working off my debt at a big firm. I loathed my firm work, but felt lucky that I was able to shrink my debt so quickly. I lived on ramen noodles, never turned on my heat, and paid off my debts in a year. After a year, my mental health deteriorated. I felt depressed and sad. 

Sitting at the firm at 5am, waiting for a document to come in from a client across the ocean, I started to wade into some scholarship. On Saturdays, before the inevitable email from my boss came in, I began to read. It was unorganized and scattered. I picked up Mbembe, Agamben, Foucault, Lacan, and Butler and then moved into more specific prison studies literature, critical legal theory, and critical race studies. 

Reading in the literature felt good in the way it had always felt good to move ideas around and construct arguments. But, with no mentorship, I felt frustrated by my inability to see the large structure of scholarship on crime and punishment. I considered applying to PhD programs. Again.  

Applying to grad school felt even dumber than before. The market would be even worse in six years. I was now closing in on thirty. My now-husband was on the academic market and might get a job in Kentucky and then what would we do? Besides, I now had literally no excuse for naïveté. I knew exactly how paltry PhD funding was. I knew about the catty politics. I knew about subjective standards and the stupid ways in which Ivy-league reputations still matter. I knew about how many people dropped out or were on the market for years in a row, indefinitely lingering in their departments until the funding was pulled. 

I put the idea of grad school away, again. I looked into criminal justice reform jobs. They are tricky to get for an attorney with no policy degree or no PhD. I got a couple of nibbles, but no bites.  

I quit my firm job. I started essay consulting for law school applicants. It was at least working with students, which I loved. It made nothing, but I was happier than at the big law firm. Then, Covid hit. My business basically evaporated.  

I feel so confused and frustrated. I want to just shut up and embrace being a lawyer who makes normal money, does a normal job. The idea of working in another firm makes me want to cry. I was so depressed, guys. So. Depressed.  And I feel like academia is haunting me. I know it's stupid to still hang onto this dream from six years ago, but it just won't go away. 

What would I even study? English? That seems weird, given the constellation of my current interests. I could look at post-45 depictions of incarceration in fiction, I suppose. Is American Studies still a thing anywhere besides Yale? I don't want to do the quantitative data analysis required in an American criminology department. UC Irvine has a more sociology-based criminology department, but I don't have a sociology degree. Or should I maybe look in media and communications departments? 

Maybe I should just get over my extreme social anxiety in writing to my professors from five years ago, apply, and see what happens? But then possibly departments won't even be funding candidates next year because of Covid. And my partner will be back on the market next year when his postdoc ends. 

I am trying not to just sit around and be a privileged whiner. I am doing some volunteer work for  justice reform organizations that are reacting to the amazing efforts by protesters to spur change right now. It feels good to use my degree, but I just can't scratch that academic itch. 

TLDR:  I still want a PhD. The legal market is basically dead right now. The academic market looks  dead right now. I feel like I am losing my actual mind over ruminating over this decision for a half-decade.  

I just really needed to type that aloud. I know no one can advise me about whether to go to a PhD program in the end, but if you have general advice or if my interests look like they might fit in a particular department, I would appreciate any advice.",4,2020-06-08 22:39:27

18yfti,professoringlip,t2_7me2p,What is your take on administrators at the university? ,"Admissions, student life, AVPs, Deans, etc. Are they useful? Overpaid? Too many? Not enough? I've read in the Chronicle and heard through word of mouth that there's a lot of tension between admin and faculty groups, and I'm curious what others here think about this.

Edit: Chronicle article http://chronicle.com/article/Counting-Up-the-Campus-Work/136477/

Edit two: full text:
 Byline: Jenny Rogers

For years, faculty members have pointed to the sluggish growth in the number of tenured professors and complained that university payrolls are filled with too many administrators. This, they maintain, adds unnecessary costs and takes the focus away from teaching and learning.

But whether such ""administrative bloat"" is really occurring and how much it matters on campuses are complex questions to answer.

To examine the issue, The Chronicle obtained detailed payroll information from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln for the past decade. The data help resolve the questions but pose more: Who really counts as an administrator? Are the jobs of librarians and student advisers academic at their core, or do they do more to fulfill technological or service-oriented functions? And just how many scientific illustrators, sewing technicians, and meat cutters does a university need?

The debate about counting faculty and administrative staff often takes an ""us versus them"" tenor, and in the conversation important nuance may be lost. Much of the growth has been in jobs that are not new layers of managers and administrators but rather in positions that provide a growing array of services to students, support research functions, and respond to changing technological needs.

The way that work has evolved on Nebraska's flagship campus, for example, has led to rapid growth in information-technology jobs and research staff, an increase in positions in sports and recreation and in campus security, and downsizing in the library.

Among Nebraska's 6,119 current employees, 29.3 percent are in faculty positions and 70.7 percent fill other kinds of jobs, working as administrators or staff members largely outside of the classroom. Those proportions haven't shifted much over the past decade.

The number of people working in administrative faculty positions, such as department heads, chairs, and deans, has actually declined, by 5 percent, from 2001 to 2012, a trend suggesting that concerns about bloat in administration might be overblown.

During the same period, the ranks of tenure-track faculty, not including administrative faculty, grew by less than 0.2 percent, while the number of faculty members working off the tenure track increased by 26.4 percent, a trajectory that gives empirical backing to the concerns of professors who say faculty influence on key university decisions is weakening. When administrative faculty are included, the growth in tenure-track faculty becomes a decline of 0.3 percent.

In recent years, the debate over administrative bloat has taken on more weight as public scrutiny of higher-education costs has intensified. Concerns about universities paying the salaries of too many administrators have been fueled by worries about the increases in college and state budget cuts, which have forced the downsizing of academic programs.

Symbolic Debate

In some ways, though, the conversation about what would make for the best administrator-to-faculty ratio is as much a symbolic debate as a budgetary one. As the number of administrators increases, and the proportion of faculty working off the tenure track grows, some worry that faculty are becoming marginalized.

""There was a time when the university was its faculty,"" says Jane Wellman, executive director of the National Association of System Heads. ""A lot of universities really kind of talk about themselves that way. That's your biggest asset, your brand, that's who you are: your faculty.""

No one disputes the importance of the faculty. But, Ms. Wellman says, the increasing number of nonfaculty members at universities may be a new reality, one that incites those professors and researchers who feel that a university should be guided more by the people who are directly involved in teaching than by those who are supervising or supporting the instructors.

At Nebraska, the number of jobs that directly involve teaching has increased faster over the past decade than the number of positions that do not directly involve the classroom. But, amid budget reductions that have led to program cuts in recent years, the sheer size of the nonteaching ranks still troubles some professors.

""There's a lot more people sitting in a lot more desks,"" says Michael W. Hoffman, a professor of electrical engineering. If a university is an organism, he says, the students are the lifeblood, the administrators a disease, and the faculty the immune system. ""While it's a joke,"" he adds of his metaphor, ""there is perhaps more than a kernel of truth in that.""

In 2011, Nebraska eliminated three academic programs -- a graduate degree in classics, an undergraduate program in industrial engineering, and the elementary and secondary art education program -- to absorb budget cuts. At the time, Christopher Marks, an associate professor of organ studies, found himself and his program on the chopping block, too.

Eventually an academic-planning committee recommended that the organ stay at the university, and Mr. Marks with it. ""The message is what you're teaching isn't valuable anymore,"" he says of the cuts. ""That's horrible for morale.""

Now with tenure, he feels more secure at the university, but the increasing number of nontenure faculty worries him. ""I understand the economics behind it,"" he said, ""but I think it's too bad that economics are driving all of the decisions.""

The university added a new category of faculty job in 2007, the professor of practice, a contract position designed for people who wanted to focus on teaching rather than research. This year there are 80 such professors. But administrators now want to increase the number of tenure-track professors, by as much as 20 percent by 2017, says Ellen Weissinger, senior vice chancellor for academic affairs. She wants to see tenure-track professors increase in number and in percentage of all faculty.

Even when academic programs aren't in danger of elimination, ""administrative bloat"" can be an issue, says Jonathan Robe, a research associate at the Center for College Affordability and Productivity. ""It takes away resources from the research, teaching, and public-service mission of the university and diverts them to other areas of spending that don't have a direct relation to those core missions,"" he says.

Ms. Wellman, though, says the cost of adding administrators is simply not significant enough in universities' overall budgets to be the cause of increasing tuition or higher-education costs. At the University of Minnesota, for example, the cost of administrative oversight accounts for 9 percent of expenditures.

Different Conclusions

The Platte Institute for Economic Research, a think tank in Nebraska, commissioned Richard Vedder, director of the Center for College Affordability and Productivity, and two of his colleagues, including Mr. Robe, to analyze staff trends and the value of the University of Nebraska system for students. The institute's report, released in May, criticized the system for having high administrator-to-faculty rates compared with national averages and for having low four-year graduation rates compared with peer institutions.

The study found that American universities have an average of 17.34 full-time-equivalent staff but only 6.21 full-time-equivalent faculty per 100 full-time-equivalent students. The Nebraska system has 20.34 full-time-equivalent staff and 7.07 full-time-equivalent faculty per 100 full-time-equivalent students. The report concluded that, with a relatively large staff and a relatively low graduation rate, the university system was not providing a good value for students.

Mr. Vedder says he joked at the time of the report's release that if he stretched all the system's excess administrators end-to-end, they would extend from the steps of the state Capitol across the Cornhuskers' Memorial Stadium football field. ""Everybody laughed,"" he says. ""But no one disagreed with my calculations.""

However, James E. McClurg, chairman of the university system's Board of Regents, did object to the study. In July he released a statement noting the 5-percent drop in the number of administrative employees. The university, he added, had made $76-million worth of budget cuts since 2000 to try to keep tuition as low as possible.

Nebraska administrators say they hold important roles in facilitating the work of professors and students. They fight the image that ""administrator"" is a bad word, and take pains to point out the ways in which administrators are professors and scholars, too.

""There's a conception among some that administrators aren't doing anything,"" says Harvey Perlman, Nebraska's chancellor. ""The problem is if it's work that has to be done, then somebody's going to do it."" That could mean anything from taking out the trash to making sure the university complies with research regulations. If administrators aren't there to do it, Mr. Perlman says, the burden of the work falls on the faculty.

The details of how employees are counted and categorized can make a big difference in how wide the faculty-administrator divide appears.

It's difficult to come up with a universal answer to the question of what exactly an administrator is. Some observers consider only top-level administrators, such as chancellors and vice chancellors. Some count all supervisory roles as administrative jobs. Others categorize all nonclassroom personnel as administrative staff.

The wide array of jobs in the non-faculty category, and the many reasons for growth in different positions, also complicate calculations about whether the rise in employment outside of the classroom signals something good, bad, or otherwise about the direction of the higher-education workplace.

At Nebraska, nonfaculty jobs include computer programmers, instrument makers, and mail carriers. Over the past decade, the number of jobs with ""director"" in their titles has been cut in half, to 34. Meanwhile, research staff doubled, technology jobs grew by nearly 80 percent, and student-life positions increased by 53 percent.

The university's research staff has expanded as its research expenditures grew, from $136-million in 2000 to $232-million in 2011. As compliance regulations have grown, so has the staff, along with the numbers of postdoctoral research associates, research/agricultural associates, and nontenured research faculty.

On the Lincoln campus, as elsewhere, technology experts are now needed in numerous departments. Enrollment offices have added digital-recruitment tactics, libraries have added software systems to track books, and researchers are doing more technology-intensive computational work.

Student services, meanwhile, have grown as the university has hired more advisers and career counselors. Where there were once 16 advisers, in 2001, there are now 31. They're joined by dentists, mental-health practitioners, and sports-and-recreation specialists, all hired to respond to students' changing demands, says Juan Franco, vice chancellor for student affairs.

""If we focus on some other basic needs, like housing, dining,"" Mr. Franco says, ""if we do that -- and I think we're doing a good job -- then they can focus on their academic subjects much easier.""

Monitoring Bloat

In an increasingly complex university, critics of evaluating the campus workplace through calculations of faculty-to-administrator ratios say, the ""us versus them"" nature of the debate doesn't account for the diversity of campus roles or the individual missions and environments of different universities. The employee roster for Minnesota, for instance, includes one captain and two chief mates for a university research vessel on Lake Superior.

The one aspect of the debate that most agree on is that administrative growth should be monitored. If universities were more transparent about their staff data, the debate could be more informed and constructive, says Mr. Robe, one of the authors of Mr. Vedder's Nebraska study.

Minnesota is one institution that wants to better track its own campus work force as it looks for ways to become more efficient. After Eric W. Kaler became the university's president, in 2011, he urged staff to put a high priority on analyzing hiring data by job title, and to set spending and staff size benchmarks against which to measure the university subsequent performance. The goal, says Lincoln A. Kallsen, director of financial research, is to use the analysis in the budgeting process.

Over the past 13 years, data from Minnesota show significant increases in technology, research, communications, and student-services staff, similar to the trends at Nebraska. The number of directors, which peaked in 2008 at 988 positions, has declined in recent years, to 969 in 2012. That number is still higher than in 1999, when there were 529 directors.

Taking a closer look at who the university is hiring will help keep tuition increases under control and may help reallocate some money from jobs that are focused on administrative oversight to those centered on teaching and research, says Mr. Kaler. Showing and increasing the university's efficiency, he says, also could help the institution's case before state lawmakers.

To help the analysis, Mr. Kallsen and a cross-departmental team are looking at making job titles more descriptive. A ""coordinator"" might in the future be a ""coordinator of"" something specific, he says, answering more clearly the question, ""What do administrators actually do?""

When administrations begin analyzing themselves, they bring agendas to the table, some observers say. Mr. Kallsen's team decided from the beginning that they would let the numbers speak for themselves, without reclassifying or ignoring any data. They wanted their analysis to be truly objective and, in a way, as pure an academic undertaking as possible.

""Just because it's complex,"" he says, ""doesn't mean you shouldn't try to understand it and explain it.""

How Jobs at Nebraska's Flagship Campus Have Changed Since 2001

Among the 6,119 current employees at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, close to 30 percent are in faculty positions and just over 70 percent fill other kinds of jobs, working as administrators or staff members largely outside of the classroom. Those proportions haven't shifted much over the past decade, but some categories of jobs are growing much faster than others. Communications jobs and the ranks of professors of practice -- contract positions off the tenure track -- are among those rising the quickest. Administration and business positions have declined, meanwhile, and the number of faculty on the tenure track has increased only slightly.

bahe27,roseitr,t2_165kq4,Questions regarding MPhil in the UK,"Hi, I'd be very grateful if someone familiar with the UK academic setup could help me out. I have a BA and a taught MA in Sociology, and I was recently accepted to the two years long MPhil course at the International Development dept at Oxford. I have a few questions regarding what an MPhil degree means in the UK/at Oxford.

In my home country, an MPhil is generally a research masters degree between a taught masters and a PhD. It's generally viewed as a helpful stepping stone between taught and research degrees and most people take it up only to pursue PhD immediately afterwards. 
- Is it the same in the UK, or does the MPhil count as an independent research intensive masters degree? 

- If I decide to not join a PhD program and exit after the MPhil, will this reflect poorly on me when I'm applying for jobs? 
While I do want to do a PhD eventually, I can't yet predict whether I would want to do it immediately after my MPhil or if I'd like a break to work in between. (I've suffered from mental health issues and a major burnout in recent past which impacted my ability to function in an academic setting, and I greatly benefited from taking a brief break before getting back to it, so this is a serious concern for me. I'm not yet sure if I'm ready to commit 4-5 years to a degree.)

**Does anyone's university offer the adult version of this?**

A course to cover more adult topics like:

* Cooking, food storage, nutrition (have you seen the serving size of ice cream?)
* Laundry, cleaning, cleaning products
* Mental health, stress mitigation, sleep, circadian rhythms 
* Relationships with others, family, divorce 
* Drug use (inevitable for most but don't overdose) 
* Salary negotiation, resume advice, cost of living adjustments, purchasing power and raises, taxes (self-employed artists seem to get hit by this the most)

Loneliness during pandemic has really messed up my mental health. I’m tired of being the person who wants to do a lot but stuck in a body of a person who needs to feel better. 

After being in isolation without any human contact for 3 months, I have finally decided to focus of feeling better by flying home. Upon returning home, I will not see my family until I completed my mandatory 2-week quarantine, but being home is all I need for now. 

I actually feel embarrassed that I failed the endurance test, but if I’m gonna stay in isolation talking to the wall and being unproductive, it’s a sign that I’ve reached my threshold. I decided to do this after getting advices from family, friends and fellow AskAcademia community. 

I wanna say thank you to all of you for making me feel less alone and giving me the strength to make this decision. I always thought that I’m useless and unworthy, but I feel a lot better after hearing your stories. I hope I will bounce back from this setback and become stronger.

dckxpc,colbaltmoon,t2_4h8noba9,Explaining a transcript to a professor you're trying to do research with?,"Hi, 

I'm at an economics research assistant at a top 3 university in the U.S. and I've had some free time outside of my work. I'm planning on applying for a PhD / JD and recognized a professor who's gone down that path at a public economics seminar. I approached him and we connected, and he later asked me to send him my transcript, which I assume is to get a sense of my background and whether he has the capacity/research project for me to help him out with. 

My sense is that he seems willing to mentor me. I am, however, kind of embarrassed by my transcript. My first two years in college were not great for various reasons such as undiagnosed ADD and mental health, but of course these are not excuses. My next two years are good, but weren't straight A's and A+'s with a couple A-'s and B+'s thrown in there as I overloaded in coursework. 

Is there a proper way to kind of disclaim this to him? How much would he care? I've had my research presented at conferences, computer science research experience, and have had an impressive resume. I've done a lot of ""outside"" work, like projects in computer science and statistics or self study and reading. I can talk the talk, and have a decent writing sample, which is how I landed the job at a top university. I've been feeling like an imposter here though because of the transcript, and worry about how to approach situations exactly like the one I've just described.

11ssu2,sadgrad1,t2_9d0bm,Quitting Question: Play Politics or Be Honest?,"Hello all,

Search for this, but didn't see a similar previous thread. 

I have decided to leave my program. I am no asking about whether I should or not. I have felt for a while that I am in the wrong department/field. This has led to general anxiety and at least at the moment, I want to leave academia all together (I want to go into NGO work/ or be a FSO).

My question is how I should go about it. I am a third year PhD in a humanities department. I have yet to take my prelims. I need to do this in order to leave with a Master's so the last few years would not be for naught. Yet this, like all things in graduate school, require faculty interaction. I see two possible routes:

**Playing politics**: this means I would put on a happy face and continue with the motions as if I were staying. The advantage to this is that faculty would probably be more willing to work with me (who wants to help a quitter?). I do not think my adviser would have a problem if I said I wanted out, but other faculty members are needed to complete the prelims (3 to 4). However, he isn't the most detail oriented person and probably doesn't know what the requirements would be for a terminal Master's so I'd have to talk to the director of graduate students anyway, thus stirring the pot--Academia is gossipy. Also, practically speaking, it is never good to leave a job without a secure back up plan. I recognize this, but the downside is I feel this ""posing,"" for lack of a better word, is putting a serious strain on my mental health. I have recently started taking advantages of all the services available on a college campus, including psychological counseling. My therapist has noted my extreme emotional response whenever I talk about my department. It's not that I do not like these people, I just do not feel like I fit in. The classes that I have enjoyed, and the professors with whom I have good relationships are all outside of the department (my field is interdisciplinary so this is encouraged, however these people cannot be on my prelim committee because that exam reflects your specialized knowledge). 


**Honesty**: This is by far my preferred route. I feel like posing is a waste of time for all parties involved. It has me applying to funding sources for next year that I do not even want and would not be able to use until I pass the prelims anyway. We are funded for 5 years but my ""dissertation"" would require me to travel so more money is needed for the hypothetical project--are you starting to see how this would make someone lose it a bit? The problem with this is that the requirements for the terminal Master's are not clear as state earlier (this is a PhD program and terminal Master's are for the booted).
I assume the work of a terminal master's would just be easier for both me and faculty. I am not lazy but by leaving, there are many other things I have to do in the next semester and a half (apply to jobs/fellowships for Master's Programs etc) to have a job/ path for next year.

So what do you think? Keep worrying about egos/departmental politics or secure myself a slice of sanity for the remainder of my time in grad. school?",3,2012-10-20 15:20:14
dd9qwj,geneticoddity,t2_3x6wt1ya,Getting into a P.h.D program,"Okay, so let me first say that freshman year I fucked up. Without going into too much detail I was going through some personal problems my freshman year, went in not knowing what major I wanted, and joined a frat. I ended up with a cumulative GPA of 2.5. I am now a sophomore and I have finally been able to find a subject that I love, molecular and cellular biology.

I am currently working with a genetics professor helping him with his research, and I've also been volunteering at the greenhouse on campus (the professor I am working with does most of his genetic research through plants and I wanted to make myself a more competitive candidate to work for him). I've also been dedicating a lot of my time to my classes and I've been doing well and I'm understanding the material, and I've been making it a point to talk to my professors and keeping on friendly terms with my TAs. I really think that I can get in the 3.75-4.0 range of GPA for my remaining time at UMaine.

I'm not dumb by any means, I just wasn't in the right mindset my freshman year and it took a lot of time and effort to improve my mental health. So now here's my question, I've really loved working with this professor on his research and I'd love to keep learning about genetics and one day conduct my own research, but is my freshman year going to hold me back too much? I've heard of people recovering from bad freshman years but I feel as if 2.5 is ridiculously low compared to what I think I'd need to enter a P.h.D program.

Should I also join extracurricular clubs? are there off-campus things I can be doing to bolster my resume? I'm a hard worker, I'm interested in the subject, and I want to pursue this dream but I feel so behind compared to other people I know who are in P.h.D programs and I'm not going to a very selective school to begin with so I feel that hurts my chances.",3,2019-10-04 16:31:45

The honest truth was that I took an introductory proofs class my freshman year because I was an overzealous physics major who thought I could also pursue a degree in mathematics. I was enrolled in 7 classes at the time and am not used to giving up, however I realized that the teaching style was not enough for me to understand the content well enough to get away with just going to class. In order to do well I would have to read through the book and work extra problems, and this was time I did not have between all my other classes and research. This led me to withdrawal to spare my GPA and mental health. The highest grade you can earn at my university is an A+ and I came out with all A+'s that semester, so I guess this stands as proof of what I said.

I do not like lying and feel as if my reasons are not at all justified. Even after dropping the class I was still working around the clock for the entire semester and still felt run down and depressed at times, so I am being genuine when I say my mental health wouldve been detrimentally effected. I am afraid my reasonings will make me come off as a quitter when things get tough (something I cannot image most schools and programs are looking for). It is my only withdrawal and I see none happening in the near future, as I have learned my lesson the first time.

I am currently stuck working on my thesis proposal. I know what the thesis will be, more or less inside and out. I have a committee, including 'important people in the field'. It's more than half done, I have most of the materials, I just can't push myself to finish it for a number of reasons.

The main trouble I have is that I think parts of it (parts that are really important for motivating it and pushed hard by my advisor and important to motivation to the thesis/funding) are largely 'crank-ish'. That is to say, I think they are really grandiose, nonsensical, and delusional. I can't make much sense of these claims when I actually look into the details of how it would work. When I ask him reasonably basic questions about the problem it is addressing, it's mostly apparent that he doesn't understand basic aspects of the problem and how they could or couldn't work. Generally speaking, I feel like someone working with a scientist from a science fiction movie where they say cool sounding future stuff, but when I look up what they're talking about it's mostly gibberish or reheated ideas that aren't quite coherent.

I have also had problems more than a couple times in the past where his skills/opinions don't line up with his claimed past in pretty brazen/flagrant ways. I don't want to get too specific, but stuff has been flubbed in ways that really shouldn't happen to anybody who isn't a complete beginner, and he'll get angry or deny it when I point out the obvious mistake that is happening. On the other hand, I can totally say the opposite as well, where I can say almost for a fact that he has to be brilliant in some categories, even if not when it comes to basic skills/critical thinking in others. This just makes things more confusing, since I pretty regularly hear things I know are 100% wrong or nonsensical in categories that are more well understood.

I really don't know what to do. Just trying to talk to people (including my advisor) over their egos is super intellectually exhausting to begin with, and now there is an added layer of me feeling potentially coached to pretend that what I'm working on makes more sense than it actually does or becoming delusional or a crank myself, which I really don't want. It's wreaking havoc on my mental health and sort of feeding itself as a problem on my psyche, and making it harder and harder to make progress. I don't want to get up in front of people and try to argue it's a good idea in ways that I don't think make sense, but I also want to get a PhD to make good on all the time I have put into this, and it's tearing me apart.

Currently, I am planning to take a gap year (or two) after earning my bachelors in biochemistry before continuing on into either a masters or PhD program and I am in desperate need of some advice regarding jobs outside of academia.

I am a bit lost as of right now because my original intention was to go straight into a masters after undergrad, but do to mental health-related stress I feel like I really need a break away from academia to figure things out. I sort of realized too that since high school I have truly never had a chance to sit down and truly figure out what it is that I want to do in life. 

I’m mainly taking the time to also determine if I truly want to go for a PhD or not. I enjoy research and came to love microbiology in the past two years, but I still do not know what area of microbiology that I’d want to go into during a PhD program. I also feel that personally I shouldn’t consider a PhD program unless I’m 100% committed and I know that this is without a doubt what I want to do in life because I know it requires fucking commitment.

At the moment, I am curious to either work in industry or find a technician position. However, I am not certain too what types of jobs are even out there. The past few years I’ve worked solely at my university by being a teaching assistant. What I’d like the most is some form of job that will help me learn new skills and give me experience that I can use later in life, either outside or inside academia. 

My plan in the spring before I graduate is to take two courses that focus on the biology and chemistry side of industry GMP.

biwmuj,3pt1415926,t2_3naa04bw,"Considering Mastering Out Due to Multiple Reasons, Looking for Similar Experiences","Hello everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I am working towards a PhD in a STEM field at a public university. For the past few months, I've had doubts about whether it is still worth it for me to continue to work towards this. I know I have imposter syndrome, as well as other mental health issues, such as anxiety, perfectionism, FOMO, and maybe more. Let me give you some background.

&amp;#x200B;

I attended undergrad at the same school I'm attending now. I have been in graduate school for 3 years, and I am due to take my comprehensive exams in the summer. My first year of grad school, I entered as a Master's student, with hopes of finishing that degree, working for a bit and maybe coming back to do a PhD. In the spring of that year, my adviser suggested that I switch to a PhD instead. He clearly saw something in me, and also stated that it would be smart to do it now, since it would be more work down the road if I wanted to get my PhD later. I agreed and decided to do it. Fast forward two years, and now I have no desire to attend class, have not published one paper yet, and am still unsure of what I actually want to do research in.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to note that my adviser is a ""scatter-brain"" of sorts, and it seems that he gets distracted easily when I suggest something new I'd like to look into. This has resulted in a paper I worked on for over a year that hasn't been touched in about 3 or 4 months, because he hasn't looked it over like he said he would.

&amp;#x200B;

I would also like to note that I am seeing a therapist, since the beginning of this year.

&amp;#x200B;

I've sort of made a personal decision to not do anything drastic until after I take my exams, but I'm losing focus on the now over this and finding it difficult to study, do work, and attend class. I recently reached out to one of my professors about the issues I've been having, as well as an issue with not being interested overall in the course they were teaching. They said they understand (to put it simply), and are happy to talk over a drink about their experience and why a PhD was right for them.

&amp;#x200B;

I've researched jobs and it seems that for the type of person that I am (I like having instructions on how to do things and then doing them, I don't like making decisions however I do like adding my two cents about things), and it seems like a Master's may be the better choice for me. But it would also feel so great to finish and beat that dissertation and get the doctorate.

&amp;#x200B;

So at this point, I feel like I have no one to get advice from regarding this. Everyone I know either has a PhD or is working towards one, and I just wish I could have some insight from those who decided it wasn't for them and how things turned out. (Note, I don't feel comfortable asking my peers, at least not yet).

&amp;#x200B;

I would appreciate any insight that anyone has. These past few months have been really difficult on me mentally, and I feel like I'm at a breaking point. Thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I am considering mastering out, but I feel like I have nobody to talk to about this.",2,2019-04-30 00:01:45
cyf9y5,martaestrela03,t2_n7wk9,Starting my PhD and I need some counseling!,"Hello fellow academics!

I'm starting my PhD in Public Policy in two weeks, and I think I need some advice on what to do.

I'm a 23 year old student, and I've just finished my Master's in Management and Health Economics with a pretty good GPA, and my thesis was related to mental health policy, which made it possible for me to write a chapter on a national report. I've also been part of some projects for some competitions since my BSc, which also helped me to gain skills related to research. Besides this, I was invited by a professor to give two seminars at my old university - to which i'm returning now on my PhD.

Now, the thing is: besides the aforementioned (none of which were a job, and all were a ""one time thing""), I don't think I've made much else, and I'd really like to start working on research, and maybe starting to teach some classes.

How should I approach my professors - the ones from my PhD and the ones from my BSc, since they're from different departments? Should I focus on trying to get a PhD scholarship first, or should I try to participate in ongoing projects?

Thank you all in advance!",2,2019-09-01 20:42:13
c2khgb,RainWolfheart,t2_o9dvb,"Theatre undergrad conflicted about what to do next, need advice","I've got 2.5 semesters left with my BA in Theatre with minor in Women's Studies at the University of Ottawa. It has come to my attention that what I was originally envisioning—picking up next September at the same school with a two-year MA, taking a few years to do some studying/work abroad or elsewhere in Canada, then returning to Ottawa permanently to get my PhD and teach—isn't realistic, because most people are expected to work in places they didn't study at. I hadn't realized that, but it makes sense.

This is a really big conflict for me, because I finally thought I had found a career path, but I don't know if I can achieve it in a way that will make me happy. I have a lot of personal reasons to want to stay here:

* Even if I study and publish primarily in one language (English or French), I want to work in a bilingual environment, and Ottawa is kind of the only place where I can do that, in theatre. That's why I came here in the first place.
* This city genuinely feels like home, more than any other place I've lived. I've got some great friends who are settled here, it's close but not too close to my family, and I'm finally starting to feel like part of a community (beyond just theatre/university).
* The first couple years of my BA were rough. I was really depressed and in an unhealthy relationship. It's only in the past year that I've gotten my shit together (turns out I have ADHD!), and I'm *genuinely terrified* of losing all the confidence and relationships I've built up by moving to a new city. Making friends as an adult is hard.

I see the merits of studying elsewhere. But I don't want to embark on that if it means I'll never be able to come home. But, then, if I'm ultimately not going to end up here anyway, I want spend a few more years before moving on. The way I see it, my options are:

* Do my MA abroad, spend some time working, then try to get into a PhD program in Ottawa with that outside experience. This would probably be the best career choice, but put kind of everything else about my life (friendships, family, mental health) in a more precarious position in the short-term.
* Do my MA in Ottawa, and figure out what to do for a PhD program, knowing I can't stay in Ottawa. This feels like the best option in the short-term, but is really scary long-term, because I don't really want to end up living permanently in Winnipeg or whatever just because that's the only place that would take me. Also, if I do my MA in Ottawa, my program is almost entirely paid for by scholarships, which is a huge perk I'm not guaranteed elsewhere.
* Give up on my dreams of doing research and get qualified to teach high school instead. AKA, giving up, but this would probably be a safe choice.

Everyone around me (TAs, theatre profs, director of graduate studies) seems to be encouraging me to do my MA here, but that seems to contradict what other people say (profs in other departments, articles I've read), and the career paths of most of my professors. They're probably the best people to be asking, but that will have to wait until the fall.

Basically, I'd really like some advice from people who have been in similar situations and/or theatre academics who have advice specific to this field. Am I missing something obvious? What is realistic?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I really love the city where I'm doing my BA in Theatre and I'm scared of losing everything I've found here by doing my MA elsewhere; but if I stay here, then I probably won't be able to stay for my PhD, too, and I can't decide which is better given my career goals and mental health situation.

byy2ir,akapine006,t2_2yr73017,[Seeking Advice] Health problems getting in the way of making an important deadline,"Hi all- looking for a second opinion here in terms of how I should approach this subject matter with my supervisors.

To keep things short, for the past 3 weeks I've been suffering from on and off vertigo-like (?) symptoms which I initially attributed to my low blood pressure. This includes: loss of balance, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, inability to focus (sight &amp; mental thoughts), temporary black outs, etc. It's not severe enough that I've gone to the ER/hospital for it, but it's made me bedridden for a while. Some days I'd be perfectly fine and functional, but some other days I even physically get up. On bad days I try to keep up with menial/less cognitive-demanding tasks, but it's been aggressive enough that my paper writing process has ground to a halt.

As of now we're looking at a mid-July deadline to publish a review that I've been working on in a special issue. I haven't completely lost hope, but my secondary supervisor (Postdoc) has recently really been pushing that I send her anything that I might have on the manuscript so that she can have a look, which I am not completely ready for. My main supervisor (Prof) has been very supportive and not really demanded any text from me, but I still feel quite guilty for not being able to be more productive.

All in all, I am just trying to get over this feeling of helplessness and guilt for not meeting my supervisors' expectations. Additionally, I'd appreciate any advice on how I should communicate with them. They know that I am ill, and that I am trying to get better (hoping to see a neurologist soon), but it seems I have not communicated to them well enough that my illness is severe enough that I might not meet the deadline.

ddlmxt,spensirl,t2_jlu53,Mastering out of PhD programme,"Hi, UK student on a fully funded doctoral training programme at a russell group uni (not sure if that matters at all!) 

Basically, I am exactly one year into my studies and I am really not having a good time. I have been working on a project which isn't giving me any positive or interesting results, and I am not really enjoying the day to day work like I thought I would. I have also undergone some really big mental health stresses whilst on the PhD programme, and am now on a dose of anti depressents for anxiety and general low mood. I came straight to my course from Bsc, without a masters in between, and over this year I have pretty much come to the conclusion that research is not for me. I am very bad at quitting things, but this is clearly effecting my health through stress and I don't know if it is worth it anymore.

My upgrade is in April, and I a) don't think I have enough novel data to pass and b) I don't know if I can face another 2.5 years of this anyway. I was wondering if anyone had any experience of asking the university themselves to be put on the masters programme, or to be mastered out. I can probably write up some sort of thesis full of negative results, and reviewing the relevant literature, but I don't think I want to take this any further. 

I also don't want to seem ungrateful to people that have helped me, or invested funds in me, but I don't really see another way forward other than just leaving outright now. How should I go about discussing this with my supervisor, who is by all means nice but very professional- there isn't really a strong personal relationship between us. 

It is also worth noting that an undergraduate has just taken up a project connected to my research topic, and I am supposed to be helping/ mentoring him. Would I be messing everyone around by leaving? I really want to have as little tension as possible in this situation.",2,2019-10-05 10:46:00

&amp;#x200B;

He did his PhD research in liver cancer, and is now at a very well-known cancer research institute as a postdoc. He's only been there a year and a half, but hasn't made any strides in his research. His PI is largely ""checked out"" of the lab, as she travels for conferences etc for most of the year, and is past the traditional retirement age. Despite attempts to form relationships with peers, they are mostly nose to the grindstone and relatively anti-social. His PI during his PhD was also a nightmare, extremely unhelpful and unsupportive, sort of just skating by on tenure.

Long story short, there are plenty of industry/biotech companies in the area. He has no interest in climbing the academia ladder. He just wants to do science and not ""take his work home"" with him. He's willing to put in the work (he currently spends 60+ hours in his lab, 7 days a week). As a scientist myself, I firmly believe he's just had a long stroke of bad luck, and needs to change his environment completely. I think pivoting outside of his niche/comfort zone to learn new assays, techniques, and areas of research would be a welcome change. I think he needs to make himself more competitive since the job field is so immunology-heavy, and he's more molecular-focused. 

&amp;#x200B;

My main question is how to frame this positively in a cover letter, or in interviews. He's apprehensive about the process because he doesn't want to come off as a ""failure"". Any tips, key phrases, or helpful advice you can offer is super appreciated.

d4stcg,sunrot,t2_174nip,Dropping out of a four year university to go to community college.,"I am currently a freshman at a four year private university and am seriously considering coming back home and just taking community college classes. I have only been enrolled as of the fall semester (a few weeks in) but in this past week, my mental health has taken a turn for the worse. The classes are not hard, they’re challenging since I was in the pre-health track, but I enjoyed them. It wouldn’t make sense to finish out the semester, because I was only signed up for classes that would fulfill my major, a major that I am not entirely sure I am interested in. I am currently 20 years old, and took a gap year to Japan so I was considered “non-traditional” by my school. I have been away from my family twice before (I was also an exchange student in Germany for 1 year when I was 15, same program) and lived independently, so I know that is not the issue. This past summer before enrolling, I had no intention of going to a four year university until the spring, so I could work and get my mental health in check. Then, I visited the school I am currently enrolled at, and everything seemed good on paper, so I enrolled last minute. I have been battling with my anxiety and eating disorder really badly, and the free health and counseling services at my school have been working really slow. I recently had a panic attack and called my mom crying saying I was driving home that evening (I live three hours away). My family wanted me to go to community college originally to save $$, but I was resistant because that wasn’t the path my friends were taking, and I wanted the “college experience.” Well, at the school I am going to it’s practically non-existent. While I love the big city, there is a “every man for himself” mentality. This might just be the transition to adulthood...but I am seriously just not ready for it. I want to be with my family, and make a slow transition. In addition to that, I had a job lined up before I left and now I cannot even find a job where I am living in college. I thought the “college experience” and the “quality” professors and the big city life would all make up for the debt I will have accumulated but now I am freaking out because I had that panic attack, I am weary about my major, the school I am at feels like a commuter school (except without any sense of community)....and all the reasons mentioned above. Sorry this is all over the place, but that is where my mind is at right now. I want to know if I am not the only one??

d3v98v,pi-corna,t2_39zx4ods,Should i trust my gut about potential supervisor? [TL;DR at the end],"Hi everyone, I am a [M.Sc](https://M.Sc) student and I am currently reconsidering the choice of the prof who will have to follow me for my thesis and I need some advice because I currently don't know what to do. Thanks in advance.

The story (rant) needs a bit of introduction. I will post a TL;DR at the end soooo don't worry guys I won't waste much of your time.

In my country my degree ([M.Sc](https://M.Sc) in Molecular Biology) consists of one year of lectures and a one year internship (inside or outside the university) that ends with a thesis defense, and that's great, yeah, cool. I was very struck by a subject in particular and decided that I wanted to do the internship in the professor's laboratory that held two classes in my degree course. The one on the first semester is mandatory while the one on the 2nd semester is optional, but I wanted really bad to be in that lab and the best idea was to follow the optional course (btw, it was interesting and easy so it didn't bother me at all).

This particular professor has a really nice and well-funded lab, publish on good journals and several people work there.

I talked to him at the end of the lectures (1st semester) and he seemed enthusiastic about my interest in the subject, yeah, cool, maybe my dream-lab wants me to join. When I took the written exam I was, according to him, the best of the exam session and then I passed the oral exam. I somewhat had a bad feeling about that professor's behavior, but I couldn't rationalize it so I went over it, maybe I was just irrationally paranoid.

I took the second course that was more practical because it would provide me with useful knowledge for the internship and it seemed that it was a matter of time, at the end of the class they literally ASKED me if I would join them this October (remember this for later) to work on a little-explored field of the subject, super cool, fuck yeah. So I took the optional exam and waited for the results.

I scored 93.33% at the exam, I did obviously good and I wasn't worried at all.

When i came in his office to see what I did wrong he told me that he gave me that score because I made a distraction-driven error on writing serial dilutions. No practical/conceptual error, it wasn't even a miscalculation, it was clearly a single oversight that propagated and invalidated the answer, and he also agreed with me on that. The fact is that he told me that he was worried that i could screw something serious in the lab because if i made that SINGLE idiotic oversight I might oversee other important things in the real lab practice, he told me that in case I could do a one-month trial in his lab and that if I oversee something he would basically cut me off, the worst thing is that he told me that maybe I won't be able to start in October but in March (because he's waiting for an other Master student to graduate) and it pissed me off because you can't tell me something so important if you are not sure you can keep the promise, considering that starting the internship late means graduating late and paying more university fees and I'm not rolling in dough.

His behaviour started to bugger me, A LOT. He gave me the impression that he doesn't care at all about my intellectual ability, he did not say a word about the fact that I used informations outside the program to answer an open question in a creative way (but with a sense); all he cared about was that idiotic mistake. More than anything else, it seems that I shouldn't make mistakes instead of learning from them.

I think I'm worth much more than the professor thinks. There are far more respectful professors (and that I respect more than him) who have said that I am their best student. A couple of them said they are willing to give me the internship but they are slightly less good (not bad, mind you). Given that at this point I feel I have temporarily lost interest in the subject, my gut thinks that it is better to change direction and be followed by a professor who respects me, my mind and my capacity for critical reasoning but I also think that I'm overreacting, but I surely felt disrespected.

**TL;DR**: lost respect for my (ex?) future supervisor that: changed his mind about the start date of my internship, said to me that he have to reconsider my application because of a STUPID oversight on a not-very-relevant written exam. The problem is that his lab is well funded, he publish on good journals several times in a year and that carrier-wise is a good choise to join that lab, but my gut tells me that it's not worth to damage my mental health.

I'm sorry about my English, I hope it was at least understandable.",2,2019-09-13 20:39:24

cnwtaz,RandomAccountToUse1,t2_4bhwhqy7,I'm an undergraduate who got fired from the lab I was working in-- should I even bother applying to grad school?,"Background: I'm a rising senior in undergraduate, on track to graduate a semester early (so at the end of 2019), majoring in Neuroscience.

I've been deeply involved in research for the past 6 years now. I started working in a lab my Junior year of high school, and as soon as I started undergraduate, I joined a biochem lab fall semester of my freshman year. In that lab, I worked for the duration of my freshman year, the summer between my freshman and sophomore years, and for all of sophomore year. The summer between my sophomore and junior year, I did an REU (Amgen) in a neuroscience lab, and after some reflection, I decided that starting in the fall semester, I wanted to leave my lab that I had worked in for my first two years of undergrad and join a lab more suited to my interests (neuroscience).

I'm going to stop here and make a note-- at the risk of sounding like I'm tooting my own horn, at this point I felt like I was a superb grad school candidate. I had years of different research experience, I really really liked learning (I usually read papers in my free time, for example), and my grades in undergrad were really good.

So fall semester of my Junior year of college I joined a neuroscience lab, in line with my interests. I work there pretty uneventfully for the semester, but at the end of the semester my PI sits me down and out of the blue tells me that he's going to have to fire me, since he had been monitoring my work and thought that I wasn't cut out for research since I was too ""erratic."" That really sucked at the time, but I picked myself up and I applied to labs again over winter break, and I joined yet another neuroscience lab my spring semester of my junior year. This was a new PI, so she hired me as a lab tech and the lab for the semester and the summer was just me and her. I had my own project and I thought I was doing really well, until one week I was doing IHC and used the wrong secondary antibody, and ruined a set of tissue. My PI informed me that since she was new and didn't have very much tissue to do experiments on, and because I had ruined a set, she couldn't trust me to run any more experiments with them. She said that hiring me was a mistake, and that she should have ""hired a senior research technician instead."" We had had a good relationship, but once again I had gotten fired out of the blue. 

So here I am now. I've been really involved and passionate about research for a really long time, but for whatever reason, I got fired from two labs back to back in less than a year. I've talked to other grad students, friends involved in research, and faculty at my school, and opinions range from ""that seems really unlucky, it's not a big deal"" to ""yeah, everything that happened seems justified."" I've also done a lot of reflecting, and I've realized that I don't *love* bench work. I think bench work is fine, but my real passions are in learning and teaching. I like talking and thinking about science, and I think all these years actually doing the science has been just a means to that end?

So.... what now? The original plan was to stay with this lab that I just got fired from for a year after I graduated, and then applying to grad school after. But now that I've gotten fired, my graduation is coming up very soon and I don't really have post-graduation plans anymore. Do I try to get a position in yet another lab in the fall? Do I even put these two labs on my resume? My mental health has been a complete wreck the past month, and I've decided to post here in the hopes of someone helping me out.",2,2019-08-09 03:41:30

The topic on which I want to do my research (how access to mental health affects the university academic achievement of culturally diverse [Latino, Black, Native America] males) is not highly studied. 

As I am spending countless hours deciding where to apply based of professors who have similar research, I am coming to realize that almost every school would not be a good fit. A lot of the programs seem to be really great programs, but none of these said programs have faculty with experience in this field. It makes sense as there was very little research as I worked on my masters topic.

I am wondering what is the best way to identify Ph.D. programs to apply to? There are some schools with a professor who has somewhat relevant research, but it is not specifically the topic I want to do. Further, I have not come across one program with more than one professor with similar research topics.

I knew she was stressed but didn't realize how much until I recently saw evidence of it on her physically which has scared me.

We have had a tough year, moved to the US leaving friends and family far behind, we have a young child, and new jobs which we had to establish ourselves in. She has only been in this lab for under 9 months and maybe these are ""teething problems"" but I worry how she will be able to keep going for the 4 or so years of contract she has left.

The way I cope - by giving myself time outs to come here for example, by not working beyond a time of day, and not working weekends if not absolutely necessary don't work for her - if anything they stress her more. She has had mental health support in the past and I am trying to get her some more.

Do you have something that has really worked for you?",2,2017-09-14 14:32:41

I don't really see a future with my current major though, and now considering to switch &amp; redo a master abroad. I'm thinking about applying to a conversion master in software engineering, but the admission requirements page specifically said academic performance at bachelor level is crucial.

I was loving life. My marks were excellent. I was on track for a PhD. Then, I was made redundant. My mental health has suffered immensely. I'm burnt out, and don't find academic writing rewarding anymore. I still love reading journals, and can explain my ideas verbally, but committing them to paper sends me into a full-blown perfectionist panic.

She'd give me unclear instructions on things to do, I'd do the tasks to the best of my ability, but then she'd berate me for not doing them properly or too ""mistake-ridden"", even if I asked questions to clarify what she meant. I'd hand in work to her by the deadline she'd ask me to hand it in by, but then she'd say as a dig at me that I struggle to maintain deadlines. She's said I have no dedication to her and her lab, when all I've done is be as responsive and available as I possibly could. I've tried my best to salvage this relationship, but I don't know what to do anymore.

I was able to take this job through a recommendation from my undergraduate thesis supervisor, but I'm scared that quitting this job won't just reflect badly on me as a future doctoral candidate, but on my professors for recommending me. I'm scared that this ""black mark"" is just going to come back to bite me in the ass if I leave now. On the other hand, my mental health is very poor at the moment, and this situation is just making it worse.

I go to a PUI and my undergraduate advisor is super understanding and supportive, so I always thought that graduate advisors would be like that too.

7z33lj,no_limit_pineapples,,How personal is too personal? Advice on personal statements for graduate applications.,"I am applying to experimental research programs in the field of psychology (cognitive). The following wall of text provides background on the point I would like to get across to potential mentors, but I have heard from some people that disclosing information on past mental health issues could backfire. I understand their point of view on this but I am personally very proud of my perseverance and I feel that without my previous struggles would not have found a passion for this field of study.  

I have heard several opinions from grad students to professors, mostly varying. I was hoping for some insight from you all! 

Thanks in advance!

I will be graduating this May with a &gt;3.0 but still not a GPA that I am ecstatic about. I will have time to study for the GRE before taking it but I feel that my personal statement paper can be a great selling point for me. At the beginning of my undergraduate career I had a rather difficult time adjusting. Growing up my mother and I struggled with cultural differences (she was born and raised in Beijing), this unfortunately fostered a rather problematic relationship between the two of us. Once I graduated high school my family moved to a different state and I chose to stay behind on my own. Prior to graduating high school I struggled with some mental health difficulties, these struggles followed me into college, which reflected in my grades during my first semester at a university. I made the mistake of not using any of my drops and instead failed out of some classes (dumb, I know). I was eventually placed on academic suspension and decided to take time off from school to try to get my life together outside of college. I sought out therapy on my own, completed it, and slowly got myself back into college courses. I changed my major from art to psychology and ever since have made great strides to success. After getting my suspension repealed I took my GPA from a 1.2 to graduating with higher than a 3.0. I mostly maintained A's throughout the rest of my studies and have really found a field that I feel I can eventually contribute to in the future. I am wanting to pursue research in the field of cognitive psychology. I have been actively involved in labs with professors and graduate students, have a publication under my belt, and am working on more publications in the near future. I know that often times people in the field of psychology are drawn to the field because of personal struggles of their own. Although this is true for me, I do not wish to pursue counseling. Instead I would like to continue growing in the field of research because I really believe that expressing myself in this fashion has allowed me to become a healthier and better self.

4tvgv1,DropOut__Throwaway,t2_zorx2,"18 year old drop out with 4 years of college work littered in F's, W's seeking advice","Hi all, some backstory: I started university in chemistry when I was 14 through a special early entrance program for so-called ""gifted"" students. Long story short, I started out with decent marks  for the first year and a half, then had some family/mental health issues that impeded on my progress and motivation to study. At the beginning of my second semester sophomore year, I was disqualified (kicked out) from the university for having a 0.0 GPA one term (I just stopped going to class and received ""Unauthorized withdrawal""). I hid this from my parents and continued to go the university through their open university program (where non-matriculated students can take classes but pay higher fees). This vicious cycle of dropping classes continued for another 5 semesters, each semester with a 0.0 GPA. I kept convincing myself that this time I'll do better, this time it'll be different, but it of course, that never happened. 

Is my academic career ruined? AFAIK, your academic transcripts follow you around everywhere, and it's impossible to start anew because universities want you to disclose your full academic history (impossible to hide now-a-days with online student clearinghouses).

I've looked into the process of ""academic renewal"" at my university, but it's not what it sounds. You can only do this so called ""renewal"" on courses you took 5 or more years ago. Even if approved, they will only discount 2 consecutive semesters from grade point calculations. To obtain a degree anywhere in the US, one has to have a 2.0 GPA in all college coursework attempted. Right now, my GPA is an abysmal 0.89. 

I enjoyed chemistry a lot, especially my computational chemistry courses. However, it made me realize that I want to switch to computer science instead (I've also been working in the IT field for a year now and would like to progress forward in this area, maybe even transition to academia and get a Masters/PhD)

The problem is, even if I make the switch, I will have to spend up to 2 years full time just just retaking the courses I failed to bring up my campus GPA to a 2.0 or higher since I am not eligible for ""academic renewal"" as per university policy (and most state universities here have similar policies as it's based on a federal law). This whole ordeal of getting a BSCS may take another 5-6 years (I work part-time). It depresses me greatly just to think it about, it seems like I've irrevocably screwed my academic career. It truly honestly looks this way.  I honestly don't know what to do, dwelling on it anymore makes me want to break down and cry. 

Any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated ",2,2016-07-21 05:32:20

56t7i2,FedorianGray,t2_10qm5t,Considering major life change/shift- Advanced Certificate vs. Masters Degree for Statistics?,"Hi All, 

I am considering a major shift in my life/career focus. As an undergraduate, I wanted to pursue a career in psychological research, so naturally I figured a Ph.D was the right move for me. However, I was not accepted out of undergrad (no surprise), and I instead went into a mental health masters program. Having graduated from that, I was struck with the troubling realization that I may not want to be a mental health counselor for the long term. As of right now, I am considering furthering my education in something closer to my original goals. I have learned that I would love to work in higher education, as I did my internship in our university counseling center, and I generally love the atmosphere of higher ed. 

I am thinking about pursuing an education in statistics because it will open up several opportunities for me. I would love to pursue a career in institutional research and advancement, as it would still allow me to do research work while still in a higher ed setting. A local state university is offering an advanced certificate in applied statistical analysis. I am giving this serious consideration. I have also looked at a few online Masters degrees in statistics as well. I would like to avoid an online degree if possible, but I am open to it. 

I have a few questions for the fine folks of this sub. Does anyone have any knowledge of Advanced Certificates for Stats? Is it worthwhile to pursue, and will it help me further my career goals of working in higher ed, or possibly pursuing a Ph.D in the future?

Additionally, would this certificate open doors for me in the working world outside of higher ed? Or would a Master's degree put me in better shape? 

I know I am not in an ideal spot because the Master's degree I have is quite unrelated to the direction I would like to go. Its very unfortunate and I have quite a bit of buyers remorse. However, I am trying to keep looking ahead, and I want to make an informed decision about where to go next. ",2,2016-10-10 17:34:19

fxwdt5,shesaladymouse,t2_55tb6jgj,"Applying for a PhD after years away from academia, poor mental health","Hi everyone,

I’m new to this sub so please forgive me if this has been discussed before. I have had a search but couldn’t find anything similar.

I’d like to apply for a PhD in History at a UK university. The issue is I’ve completely lost all confidence and connections in academia and have no idea how to go about it. My poor self-esteem is making it really hard for me to take the first steps.

Some background: I achieved distinctions in my BA and MA from two very prestigious universities, but I ended up working in NGOs for the last 10 years since graduation because I got sick of sitting in libraries and wanted to feel I was “making a difference”. I have a couple of topics in mind that link some of the work I’ve been doing with my earlier academic interests, although I haven’t found a professor who is working in this exact area (in the Uk at least).

I’m aware from this subreddit of the pitfalls (regarding career prospects and mental health) of doing a PhD in humanities. That’s for a separate post.

What I’m struggling with is how to reach out and take the first steps. I lost touch with all my professors 10 years ago when I graduated. Despite my grades, I wasn’t a remarkable student in person. I doubt any of them remember me. I feel it’s too awkward coming out of the blue to ask them for references at this point?

Additionally, I feel awkward about approaching new potential supervisors. Why would they bother replying to me unless I have connections or some sort of reputation? Should I have a list of publications at this point that they can look up online? A website or Twitter account? I don’t do social media. I’ve also only found professors whose research interests overlap only partially. 

The final issue is funding. I have seen some funded PhDs on specific topics that I would love to apply for. But again, being out of the loop and not having done my theses on those exact topics, would I stand a chance at all? A lot of work is required just to apply for one of those. Do they usually have MA students already lined up but have to advertise it publicly for legal reasons, or are they usually genuinely interested to hear from different applicants? 

Advice on any of this from a History academic or PhD student would be much appreciated!",2,2020-04-09 17:15:15
11sr0e,[deleted],,Quitting Question: Play politics or be honesty? ,"Hello all,

I tried to first search this sub-reddit before submitting this question, but I didn't find any similar threads.  

I have decided to leave my program. I am no asking about whether I should or not. I have felt for a while that I am in the wrong department/field. This has led to general anxiety and at least at the moment, I want to leave academia all together (I want to go into NGO work/ or be a FSO). 

My question is how I should go about it. I am a third year PhD in a humanities department. I have yet to take my prelims. I need to do this in order to leave with a Master's so the last few years would not be for naught. Yet this, like all things in graduate school, require faculty interaction. I see two possible routes:

**Playing politics**: this means I would put on a happy face and continue with the motions as if I were staying. The advantage to this is that faculty would probably be more willing to work with me (who wants to help a quitter?). I do not think my adviser would have a problem if I said I wanted out, but other faculty members are needed to complete the prelims (3 to 4). However, he isn't the most detail oriented person and probably doesn't know what the requirements would be for a terminal Master's so I'd have to talk to the director of graduate students anyway, thus stirring the pot--Academia is gossipy. Also, practically speaking, it is never good to leave a job without a secure back up plan. I recognize this, but the downside is I feel this ""posing,"" for lack of a better word, is putting a serious strain on my mental health. I have recently started taking advantages of all the services available on a college campus, including psychological counseling. My therapist has noted my extreme emotional response whenever I talk about my department. It's not that I do not like these people, I just do not feel like I fit in. The classes that I have enjoyed, and the professors with whom I have good relationships with are all outside of the department (my field is interdisciplinary so this is encouraged, however these people cannot be on my prelim committee because that exam reflects your specialized knowledge). 

**Honesty**: This is by far my preferred route. I feel like posing is a waste of time for all parties involved. It has me applying to funding sources for next year that I do not even want and would not be able to use until I pass the prelims anyway. We are funded for 5 years but my ""dissertation"" would require me to travel so more money is needed for the hypothetical project--are you starting to see how this would make someone lose it a bit? . The problem with this is that the requirements for the terminal Master's are not clear as state earlier (this is a PhD program and terminal Master's are for the booted). 

 I assume the work of a terminal master's would just be easier for both me and faculty. I am not lazy but by leaving, there are many other things I have to do in the next semester and a half (apply to jobs/fellowships for Master's Programs etc). 

So what do you think? Keep worrying about egos/departmental politics or secure myself a slice of sanity for the remainder of my time in grad. school?

6w9isv,BornOn8thOfJuly,,Would you tell a professor if you had bipolar disorder?,"I'm a doctoral student. I have bipolar disorder.

As some context, I'm e-mailing a professor to see if I could audit her class. I am currently registered, but I have some publishing commitments and hoped to be all but dissertation by the end of this semester. However, her course would be useful for a chapter in my dissertation, and it would be a real shame if I missed out on it. Yeah, I can do those readings on my own sure, but in the social sciences and humanities, learning in a group can really be helpful. The other is, I'm not doing exceptionally well right now, though functioning. Im doing worse enough that my medication is going to need to be adjusted, and that can be a crapshoot in terms of energy, and even how much time that is being sucked up in terms of running around for blood work and stuff. 

And so, I am e-mailing her to ask her if it would be acceptable for me to audit the course, as well as if I were to take her class if said chapter would be acceptable for the final paper. Going in to the course, I had been planning on writing the piece I am committed for publication this semester for the final paper. But, it does not match up well enough. We had talked about this Thursday, and so I spent the day yesterday and today trying to figure out if I could connect the paper to the course better somehow without jeopardizing or changing it drastically from what I am committed to write about. Then yesterday someone brought up the possibility of auditing when I asked for an opinion.

So I'm kind of e-mailing her to update her to say, ok so I can't fit that original paper into the course, but I have this other one I could write, would it be ok?  And also, as I'm trying to figure out what to do, would auditing -- having access to the readings and coming to class to partake in discussion -- be an option for your course?

And then I am wondering of disclosing my mental health struggles right now to give some context and explanation as to why I'm so concerned about workload this semester. Just telling her, I'm registered with disability student services, here is why. I don't need any accommodation right now, but just so you know where I am coming from as I try and judge energy and workload this semester, because I really don't know how this semester will play out in terms of treatment. And also that I think it is maybe best to just be totally up front and transparent about it.

But, I am also torn if maybe that's a bad thing to do. If it's too much information. I don't think she would discriminate against me by all means, and I think she is a sympathetic person. But still, maybe it isn't the time or situation to tell someone. 

My illness has only really been debilitating enough I've had to register with disability student services for two semesters -- this is the second semester. So it is still kind of new and stressful to navigate that system. And the time crunch to figure out what the hell to do this semester is big -- have to decide by monday.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your insights. I've emailed the professor and heard back from her. I wanted to take care of this quickly, and when I saw janemfraser's advice, it made sense to me, and that's what I did. All (I think) is well in the world. She replied back. It looks like I will audit. ",2,2017-08-27 01:25:35
62rv4a,moojumpedoverthemoon,t2_5btc9,Methodology help - psychology PhD,"I'm conducting some qualitative research on staff understandings of perinatal mental illness, in order to explore how staff teams in perinatal mental health services make sense of perinatal mental illness.


This came about from looking at how psychology generally has moved from a medical model to a psychological model to understand and treat mental illness.


The idea is that there are qualitative studies looking at how mothers experience perinatal mental illness, and these studies suggest that they understand their problems in terms of psychological issues (adjustment to change, lack of social support) rather than medical problems (hormone changes etc).


However, there aren't many studies looking at what staff think and how staff therefore treat mothers. There are guidelines, which predominantly suggest medicalised interventions with psychological ones to support them. I want to explore what staff think, and whether or not this is in line with what the guidelines recommend.


I want to do this using focus groups of perinatal mental health teams, as I feel capturing the team dynamic will be more useful than capturing individual constructs, as treatment decisions are made in teams. Additionally the teams I have spoken to would prefer to do focus groups than individual interviews.


I've looked at using critical discourse analysis, thematic analysis, frame analysis and repertory grids.


I feel critical discourse analysis is too language-focused and the idea of a 'social problem' does not fit well.


I'm not sure if I can use repertory grids to study teams.


I've not been able to find much literature around frame analysis, although it looks very suitable!


Thematic analysis appears overly simplistic for my aims, and I can't currently justify using it unless I have a solid rationale for rejecting alternative methodologies.


I'm floundering and I would really appreciate any guidance anyone can give, or just space to bounce off people and come to a justified decision!",2,2017-04-01 10:05:43

kuinkh,Time-Equipment9261,t2_9r7kvmcm,How to move forward?,"Note: Made this throw-away account for this topic only, will be checking it in the next few weeks/months.

I am currently in what was supposed to be my fourth and last year of PhD (started Oct 2017). I am actually only at the start of my work, I feel lost and helpless - and I don't know what to do. I am going to pour my heart out and hope for the best... I hope that is ok. Sorry for the long text, but it is hard to keep my thoughts straight.

I told myself that I would take the ""winter break"" and try to figure things out. I am working on getting a new therapist, but that will take some time. I should have messaged my supervisor this week, but I still haven't. I can't bring myself to type the e-mail, and I can't decide on what it should say.

1. Am I asking for a PhD that I will do at my own pace over a course of a decade\*? How should I do that?
2. Am I quitting? How should I do that? How can I keep the disappointment to a minimum? ...and how do I stay in the country while I switch my visa over? And what do I do as work in the meanwhile? (yes... I know not all questions are really suited for this subreddit... I am just typing as things come to mind).
3. Am I staying? How can I justify that I will stick to the work this time? Especially with me not talking to them in the past weeks? And all the times I have not worked in the past?
4. Am I here to finish just one paper and complete my contact (until Oct 2021)?

\*(my husband knows it is a common practise for some other fields to do this at our University)

There is an elaborated description of past events below. Here is the TLDR: I was a workaholic in the past (consistently says 60-80h weeks of work and loving it), and now I struggle to put in even 4 hours of work a week. I had more then a few health issues which are mostly resolved now and mental health troubles which were not adequately resolved and I am seeking help for (but this takes time). I have ""started"" my PhD a total of 7 times between my first year and this moment (start 4th and last year) and then had to stop working. I no longer want to be an academic and I do not need a PhD.

Not getting a PhD means:- not having a PhD;- visum headaches/job hunting headaches/learning new skills;- having to explain a 3 year gap in my CV;- failing the people who supported me (my parents, my professors, my husband);- more emotional turmoil to work through- possibly having to pay back a subsidy of 15 000 eur I was given for housing (used to help my parents)

Even with all these downsides, I can't bring myself to focus on my work and do what I am supposed to do. I don't know what is wrong with me, or how to fix it.

*Past events in more details:*

Before my PhD I was top of my class, always working on research, outreach, internships, mentoring, tutoring, science camps... you get the picture. I had always been tough/resilient (raised by single mom, started helping with the bills very young, taking care of myself and then the both of us...). At the start of my PhD I was transitioning from theory/simulations to observations (in astro). I had a postdoc (lets call him *Dave*) as my go-to supervisor. I also have an official mentor (lets call him *Mark*) who is a full-professor. Mark was supportive until a year ago, then he lost faith in me -- and I can't blame him. Dave was toxic to me and starting my PhD with him seriously hurt me mentally. They made me feel incompetent and unintelligent, and since they had a good relationship with other members of the institute my complaints went ignored.

The start of my PhD was not a good time for me - death in the family, housing issues for my parents who live 2000km away, suddenly getting dumped by fiancé of 7 years, harrasment by one of the other PhD students, breaking an arm, physical therapy, and not much help with psychologial therapy.

At the start of my 2nd year I was determined to turn things around. I was actively looking for/asking for a therapist for my work anxieties. I started to build up my confidence bit by bit, started dating, met a great man (who is now my husband, and without whom I could not have gotten through any of this...). I got assigned a new postdoc (lets call her *Amy*). Amy is great, but I feel like I have let her down so many times.

Just a short month after I was making some progress I had a horrible accident - I broke my spine. I had to be bed ridden for 4 months and after that I had so much therapy. I tried coming back to work several times only to be forced to do more therapy due to horrible pain. All this time, I am feeling worse and worse. I had a total of 10 sessions with a therapist, and that helped temporarily, but I am still feeling stuck.

In the 3rd year it was discovered that I had a huge ovarian cyst, and the whole next year was a cycle of fear and pain for me. Not knowing if I will have to get it removed, not knowing if I will be able to have a child (which I had always wanted to). I got another therapist who would take me - they couldn't speak English very well and that was a limiting factor. She let me go after getting better for a bit, and I didn't know who to turn to after getting worse again. My cyst finally stabilised and shrunk this summer, and Mark told me point blank that I had to get going with my PhD if I want to finish it.

And I tried, and I failed to work. I know doing science isn't smooth sailing, but at the moment it feels like doing 1h of work consumes all my available energy. Even running my code and ending up with a bug makes me burst into tears and have an onslaught of negative thoughts/emotions. Back in September there was an online conference, I had to have my camera off for most of it, as I was just crying most of the time, and angry the rest of the time (somehow that is one lvl below crying, I don't know).

I don't know how to make this PhD a success story. Looking back, I can clearly see places where I should have acted differently and I know I can't change it, but I also don't know how to move forward, and how to make sure that I don't get into the same situation again where I get a good job and then ruin it for myself.

dso1rz,blackberry_bonnet,t2_36y0p2e1,Falling behind in classes because of brain fog; can't explain or treat it -- how do I handle this?,"Hi, 

In the beginning of this semester, I was doing great and getting A's on my exams. I love all my classes and wanted/want to go to graduate school. When I thought I might have to drop a class, I literally cried (and ended up keeping it). 

But over the past few weeks I've had a problem with brain fog and fatigue that's only gotten worse and worse. I have a long-term undiagnosed illness (already seen lots of doctors, tried lots of stuff and registered with the disability office), but because of being undiagnosed, I don't know if the brain fog is from that or from something else like mental health or stress or burnout. It may be inflammation related, but my doctors cannot know anything for sure.

But for the past week, I have slept and slept, struggled to get out of bed, missed classes. Even just sitting up at a desk with books is a huge effort, and even when I manage to force myself to ""study"", my brain somehow does not have the power to read more than a few pages or retain information. Because of this, I have already completely screwed up a midterm (after acing the first one), missed two homework assignments, and am missing an opportunity to re-write a paper (deadline in a few days). I am far behind in 2/3 classes. I could probably still catch up, but the thing is my body won't cooperate. I want to catch up more than anything and do better, but it's 4:00p and I'm falling asleep, and when I sit down with books I still don't get anything done. 

I've tried everything I have access to -- unholy amounts of caffeine, B12 and vitamins and energy supplements, handfuls of anti-inflammatories, more sleep and less sleep, pomodoro timers, blocking websites, but nothing seems to help the fatigue and brain fog. 

It is really distressing and upsetting to be falling behind and doing poorly in classes that are vital for my major. I'm afraid I could lose my shot at graduate school. And most of all, I have no idea what to do. I don't even know if I can get an extension on my current assignments because I've already gotten several (via the disability center for more medical issues). Even if I do, how can I do the work better in a few days than I can today (answer: I probably can't)? Is there anything I'm missing? What should I be doing right now? 

I think I need to meet with professors, but what exactly can I tell them? What should I even be asking for?

 I'm already an older undergraduate so I DON'T want to withdraw or take time off, and besides there's no guarantee this will ever change. Usually I have 'bad weeks' and 'good weeks' so hopefully this will improve soon, but there's no way to know.",2,2019-11-06 22:45:54
drb9l5,Dangerdraconis,t2_3twgdiy5,Asked to write a new thesis after months of work,"I began writing my honors thesis about six months ago, and my work has come a long way since I began. 88 pages and several revisions later, I was told that after one more edit, I would be in a good position to choose which chapter to send in as a writing sample to graduate programs. Last minute, I was also told I needed to find one more committee member (I’d previously been told I only needed two). During my first meeting with my entire committee with this new member, I’m suddenly told that this paper is not adequate for applications in this field of study due to the subject matter, and I’m told to begin writing a new proposal and outline. This new member is not my main advisor, and my main advisor had never indicated that my subject would be problematic in the past. In this very meeting, my main advisor and other committee member went from saying my sample was ready to agreeing that I should write about something different for my applications. (To be clear there isn’t anything particularly offensive in my sample. It doesn’t assert anything racist, sexist, or controversial).

I put a lot of time and effort into this project.. Many of my applications are due in a couple of weeks, so I’d been advised to removed a lot of schools from my list. This limits me to masters programs, which is okay I guess, because my goal was to actually complete a masters before a PhD, but I’d put off my physical and mental health hoping that I’d have my applications submitted by November.

I have a pretty strong GPA, GRE scores, research experience, and a strong background in the languages necessary for my program. Everything has been in order except for this writing sample. 

At present I feel sort of hopeless. There are only 4 professors in my department, so I depend on all three of their letters. This means I’m not really in a position to disagree with their plan of action. 

So much work has gone into this thesis.. my advisor had even voiced that he’d been treating in the same nature as he does masters theses... at present it feels as though that work has gone down the drain.. I feel like I’ll never reach the light at the end of the tunnel... 

Has anyone gone through anything similar, and if so how did you cope? How did you get passed it and persevere? If anyone has advice I’d appreciate it. 

TLDR; was asked to restart my thesis after months of work.",2,2019-11-04 02:44:11
btq86g,amanaplanathrowaway1,t2_ru2o4,How to convince a potential advisor to take me on?,"I am in a very desperate situation, and would really appreciate any advice. I am in the 3rd-year of a PhD program. My original advisor left at the end of end of last year; a new professor in a slightly different subfield took me on, but we could never find a middle ground with questions that interested us both.

This week I am meeting with one more professor, to see if they are willing to take me on. But a) they are very skeptical, and b) I didn't have a great experience TAing for them, because of some mental health issues.

The reason they are skeptical is because I've never gone out of my way to express interest in their subfield. I'm extremely interested in it, but had felt like just switching would be giving up on my current line of research. My plan had always been to branch out into it when things were solidified with my primary advisor, but obviously things never got to that point.

I've been in therapy for the mental health issues, and have been making really good progress. The advisor who just dropped me said he's even seen some improvement in my work (which was a result of overcoming some of the health issues).

What can I do during this meeting to get my best shot at convincing them to take me on, even on a trial basis? I know the odds are stacked against me, but I think this is my last option before being booted out of the program.",2,2019-05-27 19:29:09
e8vjkm,foodtravelsleep,t2_9jlsn0y,Struggling with how the start of my PhD is going...advice welcome,"Posting for someone that does not have reddit.

Finished a masters in Pharmacology/Neuroscience in the spring. Work included running animal trials, experiments, brain splicing, minimal amount of electrophysiology, etc. I was independent, in the lab by myself every day and loved it. 

Started Phd this September with the same prof. Have been doing purely electrophysiology since then and can't stand it. I have my project all designed and ready to go, but instead I am being used as an employee per say, doing electrophysiology for an irrelevant experiment. I have no say on what I do, and this is not contributing my to project at all. Despite meetings and discussions with my prof about how this is not the direction I was promised and is wasting my time, it appears this stuff can't be wrapped up until march. Which is nearly 8 months of a 4ish years Phd doing something that is not relevant to my project.

I hate going in to work everyday, my mental health is down the toilet, it is affecting my relationship and time at home, I don't feel like this is what a PhD is supposed to be, and I have seriously considered quitting. I have 2 years of funding until Summer 2021 (scholarship = $1800/month) but my Phd should be complete in 2023 so I am not fully covered. As per terms of my scholarship, my prof was supposed to fund a 3rd year (2021-2022) but he has already said he doesn't have the money for it. 

This week I was asked by a member of my committee to help mark some papers for a small class. Turns out to be 24students x16page term papers that have to be all marked by this Friday. All to be completed on my own time in the evenings. Should I have said no? 

I have heard of people switching labs mid way through a graduate degree. I don't know if this would be a good option or if it is better to stay put, or if it is better to try and switch labs early on (4 months into my degree) as opposed to later on. I would be limited to the same university due to family circumstances. I don't even know how to go about switching labs.

Side note from the actual poster: I don't believe this Phd student is advocating for himself enough when meeting with the prof. Quitting, switching labs, poor mental health, hating work life has never been discussed with the prof, but rather what has been discussed is the frustration with not starting his own project yet and the dislike for electrophysiology and lack of independence.",2,2019-12-10 19:42:39

fdieki,MistyMeow,t2_7k8iy,How do I know if working in academia is suitable for me?,"Hi all, 

Long time lurker on this subreddit and finally gathering enough courage to ask this burning question I've been consumed with for some time.

A bit about me... I'm from Australia, currently studying Communications but focusing on English literature and Digital Media. I am half-way through my bachelors, but previously spent a year studying a different degree. This journey helped me discover my love for research and writing, and I have been intending to pursue research within the field of digital humanities.

My university over the summer offers a research program where you help an academic with their work. In 2018-19, I did this program for the first time and while slightly disappointing because the academic was a bit disengaged, it was immensly fulfilling to work on a project I was passionate about. 

2019-20 I entered into this research program again, this time assisting an academic with a literature review in humanities (sorry to keep things vague). I chose this project because I thought I was passionate about it, had a personal connection to it, and did extremely well at a class earlier in the year that contained content underpinning the larger project. While the program has officially ended, I am still working on my share of the work.

I am feeling extraordinarily guilty that my work is now a month ""overdue"". My supervisor is aware and completely fine with this as she is still working on hers and the submission date for this article isn't until later in the year. And while I have been dealing with some major life changes through this 4-month span (starting a study abroad, mental health, etc), I feel like a massive failure and it's affecting my ability to actually just complete this thing. Every time I attempt to start I feel extremely anxious, and because a lot of the concepts are very complex and not necessarily my area of speciality, I feel like even when I am able to write, I am not doing the content justice. 

All of this is making me question whether I'm really cut out for a career in academia. With my tendency for perfectionism and pre-existing mental health issues, just finishing this project - which should be really simple, since most of the sorting and coding of the literature is done - feels like a behemoth task. 

I don't really know what I'm asking with this post. What does it take to make a career in academia? I'm hoping that the anxiety I have surrounding this project is just because it's not something I am 100% passionate about - but in the real world, in the work place, how often do you get to always work on things you're passionate about? I feel very alone right now, and not sure how to overcome this hurdle - I am the first in my family to pursue university, so I don't really have any blueprint to follow. I also don't know how to handle my supervisor, because while she is ridiculously kind, understanding and funny, I can't help but feel like I've let her down. 

I hope this makes sense, I'm sorry for the wall of text.",1,2020-03-04 19:38:09
fb5yme,doug_gumprecht,t2_4dkl5hzn,Which field should I go into for grad school/PhD program? How difficult is it to go into a different field for a PhD program than your undergrad?,"I’m currently a 3rd year cultural anthropology student (I’m in the U.S. so I have one more year left of undergrad after this). I’m strongly considering applying to grad schools/PhD programs next year but I’m becoming increasingly interested in sociology and psychology. It’s not that I don’t like anthropology anymore, I do want to finish my bachelor’s in anthropology and I’d still consider it for my PhD, but as I’m reading more sociology/psychology books and articles for a class that’s focused on memory I’m becoming more and more interested in sociology/psych so I think I may want to pursue one of those subjects for my PhD. I’ve also always had somewhat of an interest in these subjects so it’s not like sociology and psych are “out of the blue” things for me or that I haven’t thought about them until now. I just haven’t had a chance to read much on these subjects until now because I’ve been busy with ethnographies and anthropological theory. I know my research interests would be the most important factor in this decision but I want to do research in the U.S. on subjects that could be done in all 3 fields (how relationships work, sexuality, mourning, mental health/illness, and things like that). 

So my main question is which field should I apply to based on “job market” or my chances of getting into a program or which program would be more beneficial in general or anything else that could factor in? My other question is if I were to switch from an undergrad in anthropology to a PhD in sociology or psych, how difficult would that transition be if at all? My decision obviously doesn’t solely rely on the comments but I’d really appreciate some opinions and insights since I don’t have any family or friends who have went for their PhD before. I’m also going to ask my professors and other faculty at my university but I do want to know some more opinions. Thanks! 

TLDR: Going to get my bachelors in cultural anthro next year and strongly considering going for my PhD in either anthro, sociology, or psych. Which one should I choose and would it be difficult to transition from anthro to sociology or psych?",1,2020-02-29 02:38:34

86neep,kittyface93,,How to get real with your advisor about major illness impacting your work?,"I'll try to keep this short. I'm a second year U.S. PhD student in the social sciences and I'm working on my second year research paper requirement right now that I'll submit for my MA. I've had a lot of health issues, including mental health, since before I started the program, and it's definitely impacted my work a lot. Last year I was diagnosed with thyroid nodules (in addition to major depressive disorder, which I'd already known about for a while), and this impacts my voice quite a bit--esp. since I'm a TA and have to speak in front of large groups frequently. I've also more recently been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, which is finally an answer to the unexplained symptoms I've experienced most of my post-adolescent life--extreme, debilitating fatigue and total lack of energy(to the point of fainting occasionally), nearly constant dizziness and motion sickness, crazy headaches, joint pain, etc etc etc. It went undiagnosed largely because of other more obvious symptoms I wasn't experiencing (e.g. no weight gain or hair loss) so doctors just dismissed it as ""stress"" (ugh) until I finally saw the right specialist. 

Problem is, currently there is no end in sight. The medication isn't working so far, and I'm still so tired all the time that I can hardly function. The final version of my MA paper is due mid-May, but needs to be reviewed by my committee first and my advisor before that. Since it's derived from a course paper last year I already have a good deal of it done, but there's still much much more to do, and I haven't given it to my advisor yet to read. With all the other school work as well as my part time serving job, the paper hasn't gotten nearly enough attention. My advisor wants to see it and actually emailed me last week about getting it to her (I had told her I would by March 12th), but I can't send it to her yet, not in its current state. That week I had an especially bad episode that landed me in the ER, so bad that my parents flew from halfway across the country to take care of me. I haven't replied to her email yet because I honestly forgot in all the commotion. Now that everything is relatively stable again, I need to get in touch with her. 

Has anyone ever had to talk to an advisor/supervisor about serious health issues impacting work, and/or had to ask for an extension because of it? OR, even better, is/has anyone here ever actually BEEN an advisor who could offer their perspective? I don't know how to go about responding to her. I have no script for this. She's generally nice and kind of understanding (well, usually), and knows about my thyroid nodule issues, but I have so much anxiety about telling her how it's affecting progress on my work. I have this fear that she'll be so disappointed in me when I tell her I need more time before I can send her a draft--just a couple more weeks--and so I keep neglecting the issue, making it worse. So yeah, any advice would be MUCH appreciated.

8v4bst,TheMirMorLab,,[Recent Grad]Suggestions on going back to school to Pursue a 2nd (3rd?) Bachelors degree or Masters?,"Good afternoon /r/AskAcademia, I'm in need of advice. I recently graduated a few months ago after 5 years of Education with a Double Major in Business &amp; Marketing and a Certificate in Supply Chain Management. I graduated with a 3.01 GPA, and was wondering what's the best way of turning the knowledge of the certificate into a more comprehensive education that can help me land employment/internship offers?

I recently learned that I was 4 classes/1 Semester away from fulfilling the requirements for the Supply Chain Degree, and could've possibly graduated with 3 Degrees and solidified my seriousness in presenting my education in Supply Chain. I've been applying for internships to a variety of companies, but it feels like they're looking for undergraduate students or students with more relevant fields. It seems that when I present my resume, having the two former Degrees/Majors at the Top, and Supply Chain as a simple certificate is damaging to me when they could opt for someone who's an actual Supply Chain Major. 

What route would you guys recommend in the ""going back to school"" route, that could help me land connections, internships, and ultimately employment?

For some more background: I was dealing with some financial and family issues during the first few years of my college education that affected my mental health and will to perform. I did end up recovering as a person, performed better in the last 2 years scoring mostly As and some Bs which did help me raise my GPA to 3.0+. 

I went into the school blind and found my true passion four years into the fact, but being only a semester away from being a ""Supply Chain Major"" feels like something I need to complete. With that said, am I eligible to apply to universities as a transfer student even though I already graduated with two majors and a certificate, or should I simply opt for a Masters program in Supply Chain Management?

I feel like the years passed by too quickly, and that circumstance forced me to simply go with the flow instead of going out-of-state and truly finding myself without the encumbrance I went through during my formative years.  It would also help that transferring it would start me off with an ""academic blank slate"", and also open up the internship opportunities only offered to undergraduate students. 

This would seem like my best chance of showcasing the ""current me"" who works hard and is capable of graduating with higher marks and the will to learn. What do you guys think, should I pursue this route or go for a masters program?",1,2018-06-30 19:33:00

I sent my results section to a co-author that specializes in analyses (but I have a very, very arm's length relationship with them) and has told me that I have used and outdated/simplistic pipeline (univariate analysis with a straightforward regression analysis in order to extend a genotype study done earlier, using the analytic method they used in that paper). She really wants to redo all the analyses from scratch using a complex multivariate analysis that I am in no way familiar with or capable of performing. 

I told this to my PI and she disagrees with the co-author, insisting that the multivariate analysis would only delay the paper and wouldn't change the take home message at all. I'm caught in the middle of the two of them and I'm either sleeping all day or going 2-3 days without sleep due to the sheer anxiety this is causing. I really want to see a mental health professional about this but waitlists for non-suicidal new patients are quite long. I don't want to push this second project as fast and as hard as my PI wants me to (I'm only in my 2nd of 5 years with the first project already published and the third and final project still having a couple years before it is ready for analysis). She's already told me that I've delayed on it (which admittedly I have) and is really pushing hard to get this out ASAP. I'm trying to go with my PI and convince my co-author that this complex reanalysis is wholly unnecessary but she's having none of it and will refuse to let me publish something that she doesn't give her personal stamp of approval on.

8h8cqr,Weird2018,,Can I even do something with really bad social skills and mental health issues?,"Hi. Throwaway account here.

I'm an undergrad currently doing a research project at a lab and honestly I'm getting so frustrated. The project is interesting and all people I've worked with so far have been very nice and enthusiastic. I get enough mentoring, maybe to the point where I feel a bit like I'm mostly doing what I'm instructed to do (but I guess as an undergrad that is reasonable and I appreciate it, also I still do a lot myself it's just not me who's coming up with the big ideas). Hearing stories of a few of my friends this is really one of the better labs here, so I guess I'm kind of lucky with that. [TLDR: Undergrad doing research in a cool lab.]

So far so good. I guess in this environment it's impossible not to realize that the others are not the problem, but it's actually me. I'm rather hard working and don't perform too bad I guess (some of my grades could be better, maybe me GPA is already to bad for anything anyway, but this is also the result of a cramped curriculum), but I have terrible social skills, to the point where I'm probably a pain to be around. You know I have social anxiety and it was really bad when I went to the lab for the first time, now it's a bit better, but I still do stuff like say Hi to people in a bad way (like I enter a room full of people hanging around and say Hi when I enter only to realize that I don't know anyone) out of anxiety. However the biggest problem seems to be communication. I guess the worst is that I tend to interrupt others when speaking, I really want to stop that, but it's so hard to unlearn this. Also I struggle not to dissociate in conversations which I think makes me look stupid or even uninterested in what other people say, though I always try to listen, but sometimes even that does not work. Sometimes I'm unable to put into words exactly what I want to say and I wish I was able to contribute to everyone speaking at a meeting (I've been in the situation before where someone else ended up mostly listening and taking notes, but not saying much all the time). [TLDR: I have no social skills, to the point where I'm a nuisance.]

Last year I tried therapy for the first time for half a year and it did only end up make me realize how big my problems actually are. I went there for social anxiety, but this is more like a symptom than the issue. I quit because I'm not financially independent and kept having to justify to my mother because she has to handle the financial stuff (well this is a different story, but let's just say it will not change until I move out which will not be before I have a salary and yeah our University does not offer free therapy only at most 5 counselling sessions per student) and also because I realized that specific therapy was not going anywhere. [TLDR: Currently not in therapy, but have been last year.]

I'm mainly frustrated because besides feeling like a shit person I also wonder if I will make it in time getting better. I really think of this more of a multi-year process where I will first have to move out and then start actually having a social life, but by that time I would have rather already started on a PhD. I guess that won't happen, I am positive no one wants to work with me for a longer time and it is even my fault. Also who will even recommend me for such a position?

Like I'm wondering if I'm not just wasting my efforts, because I won't be able to use what I learn anyway due to my issues or grades. (It's a STEM discipline, but I'm mostly interested in a rather niche field, compared to a few of the other ones.)

I mean what do I do? Do I just keep working and trying anyway at the risk of it all failing due to my personal problems? Or should I hope it will better by next year? (I guess I will have to talk with my mother again about the insurance thing rather or sooner anyway.) Should I just do the master's degree and then go look for industry positions where in the worst case I can go to another company. (But I guess without a PhD I might end up not being able to really work in the field I'm most interested in, at least not on the same kind of projects.) Idk if I was even able to condense what my real issue is in this post but it's just so frustrating that I don't know, like I feel I have many opportunities but keep wasting them. (Another example is an exchange semester which I was really thrilled about but due to complications I was not willing to apply for it at the relevant time, so there is not going to be one during my studies.)",1,2018-05-05 15:51:18
9rgwl3,jennytulls,t2_8ty1m,Is getting my doctorate worth the time being away from my daughter?,"WHERE I AM NOW: 
Just graduated with my master of education in clinical mental health counseling May of '18. I'm a Licensed Professional Counselor - Intern and work as an adult case manager at a local mental health authority getting my 3k hours to be fully licensed.

As a single mom, I don't see myself going into private practice, too risky. Although I'm going to do some research into it. 

I like the idea of research, teaching, a more flexible schedule (depending on the university).

I've spoken with a number of my professors at length about what it is like to be a professor at the university I just graduated from so I have an idea what my days may be like. However known this may change depending on who is chairing.

WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT:
Becoming a counseling professor would allow me to be able to move to a bigger city and have enough $ to live in a safe neighborhood and provide for my daughter. I also may stay where I am. I will hopefully be around more mature people and less drama (?)? I'm burned out as a case manager and dont see my client base  changing much once I'm an LPC. The population at my job is extremely intense and demanding.

MY RESERVATIONS:
My daughter is 2. She basically had a sperm donor. My mother is basically her second parent. 
I would have childcare the days I have class and on weekends while I'm doing homework.

I'm afraid I'll miss her growing up for 2 years. That I'll be so stressed and worn down and busy that I won't be able to enjoy anything with her because I'll have work, school work, class, cooking, cleaning, and a 3 hour round trip for class too.

TL;DR I am burnt out as a case manager and fear I'll have the same issues as an LPC since it is the same client base so want to get my doctorate to become a professor. But it's a 3 hr round trip and I'm a single mother of a 2 year old working full time. 

Is getting my doctorate worth the time being away from my daughter? Personal choice I know. I want feedback.

Thoughts? Advice? Something I didn't think of?

f6idha,SOSpineapple,t2_555ejelp,I want to quit my PhD but I don't know how to tell my PI,"TL/DR: mental health is suffering and I don't know how to tell my new PI that I want to leave the program.

I am a first year grad student studying microbiology. I moved across the country for what I thought was my dream program. In a lot of ways it is, everyone is very nice &amp; I've made a few solid friends &amp; I am co-mentored by two PIs who are both very patient, kind and understanding. However, I hate it here. I have absolutely no interest in what I'm doing for my research or what I'm learning in classes. I miss my friends and my family and my boyfriend who are all thousands of miles away. I thought I wanted to do research forever, but I am 6 months in and already exhausted by the day to day work as well as the entire atmosphere around me. I spend my time day dreaming about doing literally anything else. I've developed a panic disorder and I have severe panic attacks multiple times a day, almost every day. The idea of doing this for 5-7 more years feels like staring down the barrel of a gun. I've ended up making multiple calls to my campus crisis center. I honestly don't know how no one has noticed that I spend every day on the verge of a breakdown. My therapist is recommending I take a medical leave of absence, but I know if I did I would never come back. I have basically decided that I need to get out, but I don't know how. 

I am fully funded for the next \~18 months on a grant, after which I would apply for fellowships &amp; such. I feel awful because by an unfortunate coincidence, I would be the fourth person to leave this specific project (all bc of personal circumstances, not the PI or the project itself). I also know that I was chosen for this position over other graduate students, meaning that by leaving I am wasting a year of my PIs' funding and leaving them with no one to work on this project, when they could have chosen a student that may have stayed the whole time. 

As I said before, I am being co-mentored and they are both great people. I don't know how to even start this conversation. One of my PIs is also a very new faculty member and I have read that having a PhD student quit can negatively impact chances at grants &amp; tenure. I really don't want to negatively impact my PIs' and I don't want to be the one who ends up sinking this project by leaving. I've barely even started on it. 

I am thinking about asking to change my degree objective to a masters so that I don't leave with nothing &amp; maybe I could help wrap this project up while I am around. I don't know how well that conversation will go, or if its even possible since I only started in the fall of 2019 and am not very far along, technically still in my fourth rotation. 

Is there any advice on how I can start this conversation with my advisers without burning bridges? Is there a typical way people approach this gently &amp; gracefully?",1,2020-02-19 22:11:45
f5c7t7,knowingmeknowingyoua,t2_4i93cp6v,Seeking advice re: mitigating circumstances,"Not an undergrad but a LLM student and have a question. I’m hoping people here might be able to help. 

I currently have a distinction in my coursework (73) and am in my final year. 

This past December while working on assignments which I submitted in early January, I was suffering from undiagnosed bipolar disorder which was gravely impacting my mental health/life in general. As I was only made aware of my diagnosis in mid-January, I did not submit any mitigating circumstances claims. I can appeal directly to the university though. 

That said, I received two 2:1s on the coursework returned (67/69). The remaining assessments would be an exam (70%) and an essay (50%) respectively in those courses. 

I’m beyond devastated though many of my classmates would no doubt be pleased with my marks. I’m wondering if it’s worth submitting an appeal to have my circumstances considered or whether the fact I might have to redo both pieces of work is now a lost cause, especially in light of the upcoming strike action.

f512sz,lloza98,t2_gwka2,How should I approach discussing mental health with professors?,"Hi everyone, so recently I've been going through a rough patch and started going through therapy. I've been hindered academically, as a result, this semester, so I emailed my professors explaining the case, seeing what I can do to improve, and if there's any way to make up any missed work (with a note from therapist attached to prove legitimacy). I tried to be understanding since I know it's a few weeks into the semester, and luckily 2/4 were glad to work with me to make up the work and catch up. One didn't reply at all and the 4th said that it would be unfair to other students if he provided any special consideration for me. Obviously I'm going to be biased since I'm the one seeking help, but how do you all (either as students or professors) recommend approaching this discussion. In my opinion, it's not necessarily unfair since it's not as if I was slacking based on laziness and I want to receive this extra support just cause I had a change of heart. I can kinda see why he thinks providing extra support is unfair, but under the circumstances, I feel it's reasonable. I am open to hearing any advice/tips, or maybe things I can do to maybe discuss this further. I don't want to overstep or seem disrespectful by replying again in an impolite or unprofessional way. Any info/advice would be greatly appreciated :)",1,2020-02-17 01:47:09
8kwurg,mattioso,,How does one frame research through inductive reasoning within the relevant literature?,"Hi all,

Going to try and keep this as brief and as clear as possible, I've proven to not be the best at explaining this question to others today so I'm hoping for the best here!

Undergrad dissertation in the UK, conducted primary research interviewing ex-prisoners about diet, health and exercise practices and values. Approached this from a completely inductive standpoint, no assumptions of theories pre-established to test against their responses. I wanted to sit and listen to what they had to say to formulate ideas from, with a few prompts/open questions about the topic loosely if they hit a wall.

I've been asked to conduct an approximately 2500 word literature review to frame my work within the academic field, and I'm at a bit of a loss as to what is the most appropriate way to do this. 

I began reading around the topic as much as possible and broke my work down into five prominently spoken about topics: How poor prison nutrition fuels deviancy, difficulty managing weight within prison, ailing mental health help in institutions etc. Through conducting thematic analysis in my transcripts however, I've identified five key themes such as: Food as a form of autonomy and control, exercise as a part of the identity, newly formed codes of hygiene etc.

As you can see the themes explored are completely different and not at all consistent with one another. I'm unsure how I should go about this. As I mentioned I struggle to articulate what my real issue is and what I see as my potential workarounds, so please see the below mock methods I feel are available to me.

1 - I change my literature review and read around the themes I've found through my research. I state outright ""these themes emerge through academic study etc etc I will later contrast them to my own work and use it to situate its place within the literature etc.""

2 - I change my literature review to match my themes and pay no conscious mind to it. I simply conduct a literature review, 500 words roughly on each of the work in my emergent themes, then later in my discussion of results compare and contrast it.

3 - I keep the themes I have researched as a general inspection of the most prominent study within the field of research, writing as though I have not conducted my research yet. I then go into the discussion of my results, and am more than likely able to draw analysis less between literature and my results than I would in option 1 or 2. 

If anybody is able to make sense of this issue and offer me any advice on the matter please do let me know!

Thanks for reading,

9q2zf3,roseitr,t2_165kq4,Applying to research masters programs with one 'F' grade in my taught masters degree course list.,"I'm applying to MPhil programs in the UK. I've consistently done well at the high school and university level, with grades usually among the top 5 in my programs. However, in the last semester of my taught masters program earlier this year, things were difficult for me mental health wise. My university was politically unstable, with an almost two month long boycott of formal classes by many students and teachers. It was incredibly difficult for me to balance mental health at the personal level, and political and academic instability at the institutional level. I ended up recieving a 'F' in one of my courses (A- in the other three). I am now taking an extra semester to finish my credits, and the 'F' grade will not appear in my final transcript once I make up for it.

al1dhp,TheatrePlode,t2_11y6gx,Advice about end of year viva and report,"Hi, I’ve posted in here before and got good advice. 

I’m currently a first year PhD student and have serious mental health problems. I took a month off sick before Christmas and got my deadlines pushed back and I’m about to take an interruption in order to recover, but it’s been delayed for over three weeks due to sorting out funding issues. 

During these three weeks I have, understandably, been very very ill and so haven’t really done any work (about 6 pages on my lit review and some lab work, my lit review currently stands at ~5000 words). 

So now I’m worried that this will be held against me or not considered a valid reason for not having worked as much when it comes to the report and viva at the end of the year. I’m obviously behind and haven’t done as much as my peers have now (though I’m a month behind), and I’m worried the people marking both won’t consider this. One person in admin has said that though they have a note of my struggles it ultimately makes no difference, and yet a colleague has said that I should keep a record so I can rightfully explain what’s happened and it should be fine. 

I’d of thought that it would be considered and would explain why I might not have done as much as everyone else, but I don’t know what to think about it. If it isn’t going to make a difference then there’s little point continuing the PhD.

I'm a Science student performing an undergraduate thesis (not sure if that's a standard term, it's basically a year-long laboratory research experience). I am totally overwhelmed by concurrent commitments, such as applying to medical school, extracurriculars, and continuing work from a past summer job. Due to these factors and my resultant poor mental health, I have been slightly-to-moderately underperforming in my thesis course.

I am going to reach out to Academic Counselling to discuss strategies to manage workload, stress, and anxiety. I am wondering if I should also reach out to my undergrad thesis PI, and if so, how.

We have a weekly meeting so currently I am planning to at the end of the meeting devote 5-10 minutes to: 

* briefly explaining why I have been having difficulty so far, not as an excuse but to provide background context for brainstorming ways to improve

* propose strategies to better fulfill my thesis obligations, and get his input on any tips he has for workload management

* establish plans for better, more proactive communication in any future instances where I am overwhelmed to the point that thesis performance may be impeded

There were extenuating circumstances, an overall lack of discipline/direction, and a series of mental health issues which contributed to my poor marks (we're talking mid 60's). However I don't want to make excuses for myself.  At the end of the day I could have done better but I didnt. 

So I'm taking a fifth year. I got my mental health in order (new medications), and started taking school very seriously.

Here's my background. My final Bachelor's degree grade was neither excellent nor terrible. Average, I would say. This was mainly due to the fact that the first two years were incredibly though and the selection was fierce. The few of us who did graduate didn't have stellar grades (apart from the 1/2 math geniuses).                           
Everything changed with my Master's degree: I got the highest grade in every exam on the first try, and I graduated with the highest grade with a thesis in operator theory. Not bragging: I am extremely proud of my accomplishment and I truly think that I did an incredible job :)) I have very low self-esteem and believed for the longest time that something like this was simply beyond my abilities.

I realised that I really want to pursue a PhD in pure mathematics (functional analysis and operator theory in particular).  I spoke with my thesis supervisor and he encouraged me. He gave me one name of a professor who is willing to work with me but who unfortunately doesn't have available funding. 

So, now here I am frantically googling and writing emails and browsing universities sites. The whole application process is really draining me and making me anxious. Everytime I spend more than two hours looking for PhDs or potential supervisors I start to feel waves of anxiety and discouragement and overwhelming. 

* I guess that my biggest insecurity is my Bachelor's degree. I know my Master's is excellent but I keep thinking about my Bachelor's and beating myself up about it. I imagine professors looking at my CV and thinking ""yikes"". I would love to hear from someone who was in a similar situation (that is, not academically excellent but got into a PhD program). Also: should I cover the reason my Bachelor's was not excellent in my cover letter?
* What are my chances of actually finding a PhD by emailing potential supervisors out of the blue and then applying by mentioning their names? How many supervisors I should email/applications I should submit? 
* I should also mention that, since PhDs start in autumn and I didn't want to waste 9 months just waiting for one, I just started a full-time job at a consultancy firm. I am very anxious about this because I am afraid it will take precious time from my PhD quest. Everyone around me, however, made me realise that spending all day every day looking for a PhD probably isn't a good idea and that it would seriously compromise my mental health. So now I look for PhDs on nights and weekends. I am still very anxious about this though.

Maybe things will turn around and I can get a good grade, maybe I will get a D or an F. I can’t tell right now. 

I spoke to my professor about this matter, and explained that I have documentation for mental health issues and that I’m concerned, and wanted his advice on how to proceed. Not only did he not give me any advice on how to move forward, but he completely invalidated my circumstance and said I’m “not trying as hard as [I]  could.” I left having a panic attack. And now today in class he offered help to everyone except me. I don’t know what to do. 

I don’t want to drop it and retake it next spring, especially since my schedule will be no easier then, and it will be the same Professor teaching the course. But I’m so far behind and I have no idea what to do, and am doing. My work load *might* lighten up in a couple weeks so there is a chance I will be able to catch up, but I can’t tell rn. I’m planning on talking to my advisor and another professor who I work under and trust, as well with some of the  administrators that work with documentation and accommodations. I just don’t know im regards to grad school how Ws looks versus a low grade.

TLDR: I’m having a bad time with health issues and an way far behind in a class required for my major. The professor was totally unhelpful and made the situation worse when I spoke with him regarding the possibility of me dropping the class. I don’t want to screw mused over for grad school by having a W on my transcript, but don’t know if a D or F would look worse. Any advice on how to deal with the course status, or with my professor would be greatly appreciated ",1,2019-03-21 16:59:15

axytz2,Divyarathi,t2_381i20s6,CRISPR | Cas9 Tools – Global Market and Patent Landscape Report till 2025," The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) is an innovative genome editing tool that has recently transformed the arena of human genetic engineering. CRISPR/Cas9 can modulate gene expression in plants, humans, and animals based on an RNA-guided mechanism. The CRISPR/Cas9 programmable nucleases are the preferred choices over traditional genome editing technologies, which is attributable to ease in target design, the facility to target multiple sites in one step, and predictable off-target sites. The global markets for CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing were estimated at $1.22 billion in 2017. It is expected to reach $5.3 billion by 2025 growing at a CAGR of 20.19 per cent.   

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/h3vi4mzs2ik21.png

 The technique is being effectively employed in therapeutics development, and research and design tools. Large biotech companies like Millipore Sigma (earlier Sigma Aldrich), Thermo Fisher Scientific, Toolgen, Genecopeia, Horizon Discovery, and Agilent Technologies and pharmaceuticals like Novartis, Vertex, Bayer AG, AstraZeneca, Evolva, Juno Therapeutics, and GE Healthcare have skin in the CRISPR game exploring novel techniques to evolve their drug discovery and development processes. They are forming strategic alliances with crucial CRISPR technology companies like Crispr Therapeutics, Editas Medicine, Caribou Biosciences and Intellia Therapeutics to devise gene-based therapies for various genetic diseases.   

 As the research and development investment in the technology is growing by leaps and bounds, the technology’s potential has been explored in newer areas of animal and disease model development, drug compound and target screening, and agriculture and nutritional health products. The ambidexterity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in locating and altering specific genes is assisting researchers and scientists in understanding diseases using cells and animal models. Cas9 system has helped in achieving significant advancements in drug discovery and precluding genetic as well as cardiovascular diseases in humans. Novel treatments for single-gene disorders such as cystic fibrosis, haemophilia and sickle cell disease are being researched using Cas9 tools. This technique is anticipated to be useful in the prevention and cure of complex conditions, such as cancer, heart disease, mental illness, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.   

 In 2017, the global CRISPR-Cas9 mediated drug discovery and development market are expected to jump to $1,305 million by 2020 and further grow by a CAGR of 23.8 per cent over a period of eight years from 2017 to 2025. The technology has the potential to develop genuinely personalized treatments and therapeutic medicines. The Clinical therapy market is expected to contribute significantly to the overall CRISPR-Cas9 tools market by 2025.   

  CRISPR-Cas9 tools will play a multifarious role in agriculture by enabling the industry in editing crops to make them more nutritious, enhanced taste, disease resistant, and less susceptible to drought. Agriculture and plant breeding application segment is restricted in growth by several potential regulatory requirements and ethical apprehensions. Established agritechs like DowDuPont, Monsanto, Syngenta, and new entrants like Pairwise are also extensively active in the CRISPR landscape. Industrial biotechnology and animal biotechnology together will contribute modestly to the global CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing market   

 Product type-based market segments include editing tools, cell lines, animal models, and plant breeding products. Regional-based market segments include North America, Europe, APAC and the Rest of World (RoW). The North American market has the maximum number of companies dealing with CRISPR-Cas9 products or services. The Chinese government is heavily committed to CRISPR research and has awarded more than 23 million yuan ($3.5 million) to 42 CRISPR projects.   

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/k268xmt33ik21.png

 CRISPR-Cas9 patent landscape is dominated by universities and research institutes over commercial companies. Out of the top 15 patent owners in the CRISPR-Cas9 patent space, companies represent approximately 40 per cent while five universities and four research institutes rank among the top 15 owners. US and Chinese academic institutions are actively pursuing research activities in CRISPR domain.

A lot of the schools I am interested only offer psychology doctorates (with master degrees completed while in the program). I think getting a masters is beneficial because I am supporting myself through school and [in theory], supporting yourself with a masters degree should be easier than with an undergraduate.

3gw3yk,bdg124,t2_nl9xw,"Undergraduate Transcripts, Mental Health, and Graduate School","Hey Everyone,

I want to pursue a career in academia, but in the last two years while on track on complete a double major undergraduate degree, I began to suffer from acute symptoms of major depressive disorder that made it very difficult to complete assignments. Also during that time, I became romantically involved with a girl who had spent time in a psyche ward for attempted suicide and was suffering from similar symptoms. Our relationship only worsened things. 

So, I began receiving 'I' incompletes in courses, while at the same time explaining the situation professors and making special arrangements to eventually complete the required material to get an actual grade. The 'I' incompletes began to snowball, became too overwhelming, and many turned to Fs after a period of time as per university policy. My GPA plummeted and I was academically dismissed, despite an appeal with a formal psychiatric evaluation. 

My question is: When I think I am healthy and prepared, should I return to my former university and attempt to salvage my transcript by contacting former professors to see if they might be willing to accommodate me further, or apply to a different university and 'start over', taking advantage of the credits that may transfer?

I'm in a different geographic location, so applying to a different university is convenient, but I would also have less credits and have to spend more money. If I went back to my old university, I would have to face the likelihood of my professors telling me that it is too late for them to help me (I actually already know at least one that has said I've waited too long to make up the work) and be left trying to correct a low GPA.

Since I want to work in academia, the state of my transcript has been hugely stressful for me. I have been thinking about pursuing a second undergraduate degree in a STEM science it's something I've been interested in and there seems to be more of a demand for faculty in those subjects. This would also give me more coursework demonstrate my abilities and that I could maintain a great GPA.

started of my university in 2011 with doing my first year in early learning &amp; Child Care, wanted to stay home with my child and make money by having a day home.  Few months later I left my Husband at the time and became a single mom and returned back to my old job in healthcare Did not finish this program as the practicums would have required me to quit my job to work for free. 
 I could not fathom the thought of not being in school, so I started to searching for a University that had distance learning program in nursing (no luck at the time). I found a Bachelor in Health Administration program. Which was not what I wanted, but would allow to advance in my  current job and move to other management roles. My first semester was demanding, I passed but not with my normal 80-90 marks more 60-ish.  I then registered for my second semester which started in September, had to change my courses around  because they required approval that I was not granted(should have clued in at that point). Called my advisor and she came up with course I should take and got registered. At the ended of September it was brought to my attention by the program that I had only been doing my senior level course and I was not going to able to pass my current course with out having the basic background courses as I was registered in a heavy research course, four year risk management course , third/four year HR management course. I have currently withdrawn from these course and have started an appeal process with the University. All my professors  seemed dumbfound on how I was able to registrar in these course  expressed that I was wronged and set-up to fail. Registers office view so far  is there is official prerequisite and they required course so they do not see and issue.  Each of my professors have called me to encourage me to stick with this program. As they feel I would do very well if I was set-up in correct course for skill level. 
**Problem**: I want to be an RN, working as a  breastfeed consultant or with children with mental illness. I now have the option to take a distance LPN program. LPN is alright it seems like a good stepping stone to getting what I want. downside is after I finish the two year program I will be making double the LPN starting wage. Most University's where I live no longer offer a bridge program  for LPN to RN but there is still one University that offers it currently. I would enroll in right after my LPN program is complete. Other option is to take a Bachelor in Science majoring in Human studies (4 year) then do the RN post degree. 
I have no clue which is best, thinking LPN program which bother me because having a University degree is important to me . I need to finish something I wasting time and money at this point. I'm losing confidence in my ability to make the smart choice when it comes to my academic's.

**TLDR:** wasted two year of university keep switch programs. can figure out  if I  should enroll in a Bachelor of Science Majoring in Human Studies then take a post nursing degree or should I take LPN college diploma than take a LPN bridge program to get RN.

I can’t keep up with their constant demands and neediness, and feel like unless I award them all 100%, tell them that they’re geniuses whilst also listening to their (often extremely upsetting) stories about how, for example, they were abused as children, and act as counsellor, they will complain about me. In fact, sometimes they do.

alk2ur,404successnotfound,t2_349wkeed,What if life gets in the way of going further? [Humanities],"I'm just frustrated and crushed right now, extremely demotivated. I'm an undergrad in humanities and I fucking love what I do. I'm very passionate about the field and I'm hoping to get to grad school.

I feel my profs (and academia in general?) are harsh and unrealistic about grades and grad school applications overall. One prof who's a major (*really* big shot) figure in the field says he writes recommendation letters to only students who have taken 400 level courses with him but he teaches 200's only and one 400 every three years. 

Another says he doesn't feel comfortable writing a letter for me because I'm lacking a specific component in the way I perform (he was basically telling me to be narrower and address straightforwardly the readings instead of making connections with other things) and although this is fair enough of a critique I'm upset that he throws my request out the window based on this single aspect. 

My department as a whole accepts applications to their graduate program with GPA's no less than 3.5 on the basis of securing funding (which means if you have 3.4 you're fucked). Another prof said he was reluctant to writing me a letter because he doesn't know me well enough and his opinion of me will depend heavily on my grades (and to my misfortune the first class I took with him I got a C, but thankfully I can retake this class later). 

The fourth prof hasn't answered my email about a follow up for a letter since last summer (he left the department last year).

I'm overwhelmed because I can't do it all and I don't know what to do if I don't achieve my goals. I have a CGPA of 3.06 (3.15 for my program only) and I've had to deal with so much shit during the last three years that I'm discouraged by the fact that there's never enough to at least make me feel reassured that I'll go to a grad school I want (not the unreputable one that leads no where).

How can I be the straight A student when I have to work at least 20 hours a day to barely make ends meet financially, deal with toxic family issues at the same time, and mental health problem from an accident I was involved in at the beginning of my studies (thankfully it got better but it has impacted my academics which I slowly have fixed by retaking courses)?

I've been to conferences (one of them was outside the country), I've organized one too, I've been involved in my field for undergrad journals and in any teaching experience I could get. I think my sample paper is decent too. I was hoping building a little of experience on the side would help my chances, but then the prof I met with today said it just shows passion but nothing substantial enough. 

After leaving the prof's office I ran into a 50 year old friend who's doing the graduate program at the department and he was talking about how he doesn't need another degree and this is not that important to him. All I could think about is that he's a lucky bastard and I wish I was in his shoes instead. I know plenty of people at my university who got 3.7+ GPA's because they could go at their own rhythm and didn't have to work part-time on the side. All the time I just think other people are fucking lucky, even the profs. I just want to be in their shoes, in front of a classroom and teach because what they do is so amazing.

People say a graduate program is much harder than an undergrad but to me they forget the most crucial point which is that in undergrad you're not paid to write papers and be at the library. You have to deal with studying *and* work *and* other problems going on in your life. I wanna know how you guys dealt with this.

GPA GPA GPA GPA is all I hear from profs and my academic advisor. Yes it matters and I understand that. But how the fuck am I supposed to get A's when my life isn't peaches and cream and requires me to devote my time to a lot of bullshit on the side?

First, because my undergrad was in humanities so I'd have to probably take science prereqs for any intensive science grad degree and I can't afford lots of classes out of pocket. Second, because I'm unsure what careers would still be viable even once I have profound vision loss. 

Topics I've always been interested in include mental health, psychology, and neuroscience. I'd also be interested in healthcare careers that are hands on, if it's even possible to do so with worsening vision. 

If anyone is in a healthcare related discipline I would love some insight into possible careers or programs. Thanks so much! ",1,2018-10-05 19:32:24
9klmth,Moontide,t2_6jkol,"My former P.I/Thesis Advisor went nuclear against the whole lab, me included. Advice appreciated","Tl/dr: I can't get a rec. letter from my thesis advisor because we do not see eye to eye anymore and I don't think it is my fault that this has happened.

Roughly two years ago I joined a bioinformatics lab for my Masters, my P.I. back then was an amazing mentor, she was patient, insightful and rewarded independent thinking and proactiveness. We published four papers together and went to a few conferences, so I was pretty damn sure that I would get a good recommendation letter (especially since I was also a T.A. for her class, extra-officially).

Last year we had some drama happening in the lab, a postdoc was basically just playing computer games in lab all day and leeching off the graduate students' work, the P.I. got (understandably) mad at the whole lab and fired the dude. After that she was never really the same and got progressively worse month after month, starting to verbally abuse her students in front of the whole lab and stopped relegating the good projects to us (she would just work on them herself and publish alone or with her collaborators).

During this time I was in an internship in my dream university in the US so I thought it was just a transient thing, but as soon as I got back and told her of my desires to pursue a PhD in the US she completely ""disowned"" me, going so far as removing me from the lab communication group since I were ""already with a foot out"", in her own words. This happened a few months before my thesis defense, which she went out of her way to make as complicated to schedule as possible.

I am not going to ask her for a recommendation letter, as I have no idea if she will actually write about what we accomplished or if she will sabotage me. I know this potentially looks bad for my application as she was my thesis advisor, but is there any way I can communicate her descent into spitefulness (obviously not with those words) without making it sound like excuses? I'm pretty sure she was struggling with mental health issues and a lot of stress, and that she also probably felt betrayed for trusting so much in her students and having them stab her in the back, but it seems unfair that I should get penalized for those things.

Anyway, thank you for reading thus far, have a great day.",1,2018-10-01 23:43:58
a1zlv2,LongjumpingCrab,t2_2p7ml3iu,Research as a non-traditional CC student; Questions about getting into grad school,"I'm a student in my late 20's who has completed a bachelor's degree and I am currently attending a community college so that I can change careers. My hope is to get into a graduate program, although I am far from having the details hashed out as of now. 

As is the nature of community colleges, this school does not support much research, but there are several tenured professors here who actively involve themselves with research outside of the school. I learned recently that one of my professors (who I will be taking for an extremely important class next semester) is beginning research on a topic that is of great interest of me. I expressed this interest to her and asked if I could do anything to help. Not only did she say yes, but she said that if she could find enough for me to do she may be able to add my name to her paper.

I apologize for my ignorance (academia is unfamiliar territory for me), but I have a few questions--

1) What does ""adding my name"" imply? What impact would that have on me compared to if I did research with her and wasn't listed on her paper? I certainly plan on working as hard as I can on whatever tasks she gives me and I am hoping that I can be as involved as possible (given my limited background), but I know that publishing is a big deal in academia so I'd like to know if having my name listed makes a difference. 

2) What should I expect to be asked to do, and how should I prepare? For what it's worth, data analysis is at the core of the project and a large portion of the grunt-work involved is within the area of expertise of my new field of study. That being said, the research also requires knowledge of a domain that I have not studied formally but is somewhat closely related to my original field of study and my professional background. As far as I'm aware, I will not be expected to do much regarding work within that domain, but I hope to read up on it over winter break. My professor herself is not an expert in that field, but she has found a collaborator who will provide the expertise needed in that subject. Will reading up on this serve me well? I already have a decent amount of knowledge in this area, but I would like a deeper understanding of it. Even though I won't actually be doing any work within that subject area, am I smart by studying it in my free time?

3) As I mentioned earlier, I hope to get accepted into a graduate program. Will taking my prerequisites at a community college hurt me? Unfortunately, my school has a very bad reputation, and that reputation is not unwarranted. However, I have gone out of my way to take professors that maintain high standards and I feel that the education I have received here has been great. As sad as it is, the nature of my school is such that professors have to fight quite hard against an administration that does not support academic rigor, and I have no doubt that the universities I will be applying to (all local) know this. My GPA in my first degree was between a 3.5 and 3.6, but I suffered through severe medical and mental health issues throughout, so it is scattered with F's. One of those F's is in a basic course that covers material in the subject I hope to get a master's in. I failed because life happened and I was too stupid to take a medical withdrawal-- the grade has nothing to do with lack of comprehension; I did not attend the second half of the semester and did not complete the work and had so much going on in my life that dropping the course wasn't what I was thinking about at the time. By the time I apply to grad school I will have taken a higher level course and will have presumably done well in it, but I worry my undergrad GPA will hurt me. However, as of now I have taken 24 credits at community college, all of which are classes that typically have very high fail rates. I have a 4.0 and have received the highest grade in the class in all but one of these classes (and the professor of the one I didn't receive the highest grade in went out of her way to offer to write me a recommendation). I'm worried the 4.0 won't mean much coming from a school with a bad reputation, despite the fact that I feel confident I could do just as well at most schools. How much does school reputation and ""old"" GPA play into grad admissions decisions?

The reason I worry so much about grad school admissions is that I will need to stay local for grad school, and although there are a plethora of universities in my area, there are only two with programs I'm interested in and after doing some research, I found out that one of the schools I'm interested in is a top 20 school that is very well-regarded in the field I would be applying to study and do research in. The other school is one that I am more familiar with, but I am less interested in the program they offer. I can only assume that it would be very challenging for me to get into the top-20 grad program given my non-traditional background, but I'd like to find a way to become competitive, if possible. Do people with my sort of history ever get accepted into top 20-programs? Any advice on what I can do to improve my chances? 

Much thanks to anyone who reads my post!",1,2018-12-01 03:43:38

So I started a new position at a university just over a month ago (I know, it’s early days)
I’m teaching part time, and doing my PhD part time.
I moved to a new city to do this, away from all of my friends and family, and so far feel massively disillusioned with the whole process.

The department is not really in my field of expertise, but there are adaptable elements which I thought would make it okay. But it seems like a totally different world within which I feel both misunderstood and honestly just not at all smart/up to it.
As well as this, during my first supervisory meeting I was told that the man I signed up to work with will now actually be retiring before the next academic year...

I’ve never taught before and have terrible anxiety about that starting next term and feel that I’ve been given too much responsibility for someone of my position.
And on top of it all I haven’t made a single friend down here. I feel like my mental health is already beginning to suffer.

My mind keeps flitting between:
1) Staying and trying my best (though it’s 4 years and with an as yet unknown new supervisor as of next year)
2) Looking into transferring (unsure of UK university policies on this)
3) Just calling it quits before I’m too far in?

I’m in the process of trying to start up a mental health workshop for postgrads at my university (as there is currently very little support). The idea is that postgrads are often the first to notice and be in a position to respond to a mental health problem in their fellow students- so I want to equip them with the skills in how to support them (as well as covering what they can do for themselves). To make sure I cover everything, what kind of problems do you guys see or experience? Do you feel you know how to access help for yourself or for others? Is there anything that, if you were attending this kind of workshop, you feel should be discussed? 

I appreciate that most of you will have already gone past your postgrad studies, and may have students now- in which case anything you can add from that point of view (issues you see, possible solutions) would be great. Also anything that works really well at your university would also be amazing to hear!

9y4nau,petticoattails,t2_2i7cw571,Can you change your methodology in the field if you aren't getting support?,"I am in a quandary and would really appreciate advice!

I had applied for a PhD scholarship with an amazing supervisor and took up the offer. The funding stipulated I had to be attached to one of my supervisor's projects. While the topic didn't necessarily appeal to me, I was buoyed by the thought of working in a team with great academics.
Initially, my supervisor and I had settled on a mini-ethnography in the developing world country that the project was located in. I had reservations because I do not speak the local language and knew this country to have very patriarchal structure that makes it difficult for women to be mobile. Tbh, my parents are from this country, but I'm American, born and raised abroad. 
In spite of being attached to a project, I discovered I would have to arrange everything on my own. I found a rural NGO that said I could come and they would help arrange a stay for me. However, since I've been here, it's been very difficult to get data. Since I cannot speak the local language, I've had to engage a translator. This translator is actually a young girl 'on loan' to me from another NGO and since she can't speak English, we communicate in one of the national languages (which I speak very brokenly). She's fine as a companion, but since I'm doing research in schools, I've been asking the NGO if I can use one of their employees who speaks English to interview parents and teachers, whom I want to ask deep questions. I've repeatedly stressed that I'm willing to pay for the translator and a driver out of my savings. I usually take the buses to the rural school (it takes 1.5 hours to get there) but haven't been able to stay longer than noon, as the girl's parents want her back before dark (understandably). This means I haven't been able to interview parents, who return home in the evenings. Without a driver and a reliable translator, I feel quite crippled in what I can do. The NGO also wants me to do quantitative data analysis for them, even though I'm a qualitative researcher. 

I'm sorry this is long! Basically, I want to change my methodology from an ethnography to interviews with children, parents, and teachers + observations of lessons and return home in 3 months instead of 6. This is because it's a real struggle for me to get data, and I lack the resources I need. Is it okay to change like this based on my experience? I believe my supervisor will support me, but I'm worried over the quality of the data I will get. I'm also very isolated where I am and am currently struggling with both mental and physical health issues.

9wrqkc,zmcsays,t2_q9tr9,[UK] Considering a PhD but looking for some input,"Hi everyone! I know this is a decision that is ultimately up to me but I was hoping for some input from people who've made this choice beforehand etc.

I just got my dissertation feedback for my MA and I'm really pleased with it - got a distinction (so a distinction overall too) and both first and second reader have encouraged me to continue to doctoral study. 

This is something I've wanted to do on and off since I was in high school, but I'd stopped thinking I was good enough for it when I got a 2.1 instead of a 1st at undergrad. Now it seems in reach again, but I still have a lot of reservations. I'm worried about job prospects (another three or four years study for potentially not having a well-paid career after) and the mental health drain in particular, but also not really knowing how to know which course is best, when to begin planning etc, how to find funding and so on.

I would do this in a couple of years at the earliest, maybe around 2022? I need some time to do other stuff first I think - is that leaving it too late to get back into academia? I don't want to lose my skills etc. 

I know this was all ramble-y and if anyone has maintained interest this far, thanks very much! Is a PhD worth it? It's what I've wanted for years but I don't want to make the 'wrong' choice.

I registered for the 2017/18 academic year and completed all of the modules apart from the dissertation, which should have been done this summer. I have been granted an extension for health reasons. 

I have struggled throughout the course as I don't enjoy most of it and I have lost a lot of my motivation. My project supervisor provides very little support as he works full-time in industry. To make matters worse, I have to use a programme to generate data (MCNP) and I don't have a clue how to use it, so the dissertation is going nowhere at the moment.

But, this early in my career, I am already finding it extraordinarily hard to keep a balance between things that keep me centered, calm, connected, etc. and school, which will soon be work. I am assuming it will only get worse from here, this being the junior level in my education.

The above is really important to me, living as much as I can in the present has been really significant in mainting my mental health. But, the work is also important to me, it's the most at home I've felt in any professional environment. But it just causes one to be so busy - I don't have time for the things that used to keep me centered, calm, etc. I'm getting the sense that I'm engaged with two opposing outlooks (happiness comes from being calm, finding peace vs. happiness comes from knowledge, you must dedicate yourself to its pursuit)

So I'm wondering how people have balanced non-achievement-centric notions of happiness/fulfilment with work in academia. Can the two co-exist.

Btw, I am not seeking ""if the work isn't fulfilment on its own, it's not for you"" type answers. I disagree fundamentally with the notion that any work can be fulfilment on its own to quite the level I am referring to. To the degree to which it can, it certainly is for me. But, I do believe there is more to life than ""pursuits"", ""endeavours"", etc. (hope that makes sense) and so I'm seeking perspectives that share that in common.",1,2018-11-03 14:49:48

I'm a current masters student finishing my degree in mental health counseling, and have a few questions.

My primary role is as a therapist, but I find myself enjoying the little bit of career exploration/academic success more than traditional therapy.

i'm finishing up the first semester of my PhD at a top 10 university for ChE. long story short: i don't think chemical engineering is for me. i've met with dozens of professors doing all sorts of research for chemical engineering and i haven't connected with one or found a project i like enough to establish a connection with the PI and group. many of the faculty members who topped my list of potential PIs are at another campus 4 hours away. in addition, i haven't been happy in general. my mental health has never been the greatest but this is the first time i've ever felt that a community has been unsupportive. i dealt with some setbacks at the beginning of the semester that interfered with attending class, and since then, my graduate advisor has been urging me to ""consider other options"" and that ""i act like i don't truly a PhD because i'm not showing enough interest"". i have filed disability documentation but didn't have them at the time because i'd just moved here and was trying to find new doctors. i'm guessing my professors now think this about me as well since she will send me emails to check up on me and CC them, and since they're on the committee, chances of passing my Q exam are probably pretty low. i don't think this is true, and if it it is, i don't know why i'm specifically being called out of from my 55-member class. anyway, it's definitely contributed toward my mental health worsening, and i've learned in the past that it's not worth waiting it out and seeing what will happen.

making this decision has been really rough for me because despite not enjoying my time here, i love learning and i love being in an environment that constantly gives me the opportunity to learn from experts in their fields. i've been attending many seminars in the chemistry department and even sitting in on group meetings to hear what current research is up to. my initial goal was to find a PI involved with pharmaceutical research since i've had an inkling since starting undergrad research that i'll be looking toward the pharma industry for opportunities as a research scientist. ChE does offer pharma-related research, but most of it at my school is heavily focused on the biological side of things and i've always loved chemistry more. 

the only reason i'm hesitating with officially turning in my form is because i do want to finish my PhD in the future, but in a different field such as synthetic chemistry, medicinial chemistry, or pharmaceutical sciences where i'll be involved with drug synthesis and studying their reaction mechanisms. i have my BS in chemical engineering so i'm sure i will have to take some pre-reqs (possibly at a local community college?). but realistically, i do need to take it easy for a while; the transition from undergrad directly to grad school burns a lot of people out even without my circumstances. i want to hopefully take one class next semester and after this semester's courseload, i'm honestly really excited about finally taking a chemistry class again. 

so i supposed i have a few questions: 1) i didn't receive the best grades this semester once my mental health took a nosedive. will it be difficult for me to find a well-regarded chemistry PhD program who will accept me with that on top of being a PhD dropout? 2) are there general pre-reqs that aren't specific to most schools that i should look into taking? 3) is anyone studying or performing research related to drug synthesis/pharmaceutical technology who would be willing to provide insight on what the field is like right now?",1,2018-12-10 22:54:46
apvdix,harassDoc,t2_37ki4h7n,Sexually harassed by postdoc supervisor and forced to quit.,"I was forced to resign from a postdoctoral position in a major research institute in the US after being sexual harassed by my postdoc supervisor. It's been 4 months since I resigned, but I'm still struggling to move on from what happened.

It started a couple of months into my postdoc. He started leering and staring at me in public and moving too close to me during one-on-one meetings. At one point, I moved away from him slightly when he started getting too close, which made him really angry. I also tried to keep the door open when we have our one-on-one meetings which made him so angry that he started criticizing my work in a loud voice. He also made everyone believe there was something going on between us. I stopped talking to him during social gatherings and generally stayed away from him. He also started bullying me and putting down my suggesting during group meetings. It effected my self-esteem so much that I stopped speaking up in meetings altogether. He brought up my lack of participation in meetings during a progress review. I made excellent progress at the beginning of my postdoc and had my first manuscript ready in a matter of months. But after the harassment started, I got so depressed that I couldn't focus on my work and my progress suffered.

After putting up with his abuse for over a year, I reached my breaking point when he invited me to go to a conference with him. It was a small conference with several interesting talks, but it was on the other side of the country and there was hardly anyone I knew attending it. So I didn't want to take the risk. I made an excuse about a prior commitment, but he didn't buy it. He got angry and started to bully and harass me even more. I was so depressed at this point that I tried to commit suicide. After several days in the ICU and a week in the hospital, I recovered, at least physically. I went back to work a week later. I didn't tell anyone what happened, but my postdoc supervisor made it clear that he knew. He mentioned in passing that he has access to anyone's medical record, and in another instance, made a snide comment about me trying to kill myself for my work.

I handed in my resignation a couple of months after this. I wasn't in a place to apply for jobs let alone go for interviews while I was there. So I quit without having a job lined up. I also started seeing a therapist around this time and I think my mental health has somewhat improved since then. However, I'm still so traumatized by this whole experience that I can't seem to bring myself to apply for jobs. Every time I see a job I could apply to, I get paralyzed with fear that the same thing will happen. How do I move on from this and go back to work? Any advise or suggestions will be greatly appreciated.",1,2019-02-12 16:52:55
aouveb,brownidegurl,t2_7gmob,Path to FT composition teaching without PhD? Help me weigh options.,"I've taught college-level writing for 8 years, and I know I want to do this work long-term. I have explored non-teaching academic work (advising, teaching-learning centers, scholarship coaching/writing) and none of it interests me unless it's in the classroom, student-facing. 

I think a CC or SLAC is the right place for me, but I'm at a professional crossroads and the best path is unclear. While there are no right answers, I'd appreciate any advice. Thank you for reading.

**Me:** I'm 32, healthy, and realistic about the bleak state of academia yet naively determined to stay and improve things. My husband has a lucrative tech job, and is open to relocating as long as he can find work. We'd like to have kids someday, but it's not urgent; we'd like to adopt.

**Background:** I earned a fiction MFA in 2014 from a once well-regarded but becoming-defunct state school program. During the program, I quickly discovered that I enjoyed teaching more than writing, so I graduated with nothing published and a mediocre thesis novella. Still, I worked hard, added value to the program, and formed strong relationships with advisors and mentors. The 2/2 load also gave me 3 years of teaching experience, which helped me land my first adjunct gig after graduation.

**Teaching experience:** I've full-time adjuncted first-year writing, first-year seminars (writing-related), and upper-level professional writing at several colleges (state, private, CC) 2014-2018, in addition to tutoring at the CC writing center. I'm good at what I do; my classes fill quickly and both peers and superiors are impressed by my teaching skills and professionalism. I'd also say I'm competitive, at least locally. Shortly after I took the below job, the staff director at my CC writing center offered me his job, but I declined because it doesn't involve teaching and I'm not really interested in WC work.

**Now:** In 2018, I began a hybrid writing center administrative assistant/teaching staff role--a colleague recently became the director, and encouraged me to apply. 

This role has great opportunities. I'm gaining new skills (managing/interviewing/hiring the WC's peer tutors, assisting the English Department chair with revamping the first-year writing program in preparation for reaccreditation in 2021, designing/facilitating an accompanying faculty training, etc.) and I get to teach.

However, this school doesn't feel like home. It's a religious institution, and I don't share its conservative values. Moreover, my salary is low enough that I'm still adjuncting to make ends meet, which is tough on top of full-time hours. The department chair, my director, and my faculty mentor know my current role isn't a good long-term fit.

**So, where do I go? Options:**

**Get FT where I am now, and use the title to leverage another FT job at a better school.** 

* *Pros:* The chair has stated repeatedly that he'd like to hire me as full-time TT so I don't abandon ship. Although he can't conjure the salary line, I think the offer is sincere--this school is small, with a proven record of hiring/promoting from within (I've seen several such promotions in my short time here, including the president.) He's assured me that I don't need a PhD, and that my MFA is a terminal degree.

* *Cons:* Perhaps this strategy isn't viable. Also, getting FT only to leave is unkind, and the position may never open. There's one FT English faculty member of retiring age, but it's not certain he's going anywhere.

**Get a PhD and cross my fingers.**

* *Pros:* A PhD (probably in Rhet Comp) will make me a more competitive, conventional applicant. I took a Rhet Comp research methodology class during my MFA and really enjoyed it. Provided my research could directly help students and teachers, I think I could survive a PhD.

* *Cons:* I'm deeply ambivalent about getting a PhD. I like research for its potential to reveal new truths and help people, but I don't enjoy writing lit reviews, the pressure of publishing, or the rat race of conferences, networking, etc. The stories I've heard about academic hazing frighten me, and I'm still sitting on $35k of debt from my MFA. This sub advises people *AGAINST* getting a PhD with the expectation of a job, and that's exactly what I'd be doing. I know colleagues who got PhDs only to end up exactly where I already am--lecturing for $40k/year, NTT. Finally, I'm just not sure I want to work that hard. I like spending time with my husband, going to the gym every day, and my mental health. Although my husband supports my goals, my steely devotion to full-time adjuncting the past 4 years has been rough on us, both emotionally and financially. Even the paltry stability of my current full-time role has been a game-changer, and I'm hesitant to throw that away for 5-7 years of god knows what.


**Don't get a PhD, and wiggle into a FT lecture, staff, or admin-with-teaching role.** 

* *Pros:* I'm actually happy doing half-admin, half-teaching right now. Challenges are within reach, my schedule is flexible, and I can prioritize teaching. Maybe I'd be happiest finagling myself into a better version of what I'm already doing.

* *Cons:* These positions are rare and the pay may always suck.

**Publish something and try a more traditional creative writing route.**

* *Pros:* Colleagues of mine who've published even modestly successful books have gotten FT TT jobs.

* *Cons:* My MFA cured me of the desire to write; I have no idea where to start. I love books and stories but abhor the ""writing community"" and its pretension. Also, the aforementioned colleagues are teaching in rural places, where my husband is unlikely to find work.

**Return to adjuncting, but seek stable part-time work.**

* *Pros:* I have MFA acquaintances who spend half their time freelance writing/editing and the other half writing. A sustainable side gig would allow me to adjunct long-term. I enjoyed many things about adjuncting--the freedom, the flexibility, and the escape from faculty drama. And if the pattern of downsizing and budget cuts in academia continues, I know I'll always be able to find work!

* *Cons:* I'd miss my faculty colleagues and being a part of the university community. Although some colleges where I've adjuncted made an effort to involve/respect me, I could never escape the paradox: Adjuncts are both wildly valuable and totally worthless. Faculty have treated me like a queen when they needed last-minute courses taught, only to drop me without a word next term. Accepting that I'm a subhuman cog for someone's machine is a mindfuck, and voluntarily objectifying myself requires toxic mental acrobatics and a taste for masochism.

fgu2vn,Wavedeli,t2_2wx04u66,Research Lab Advice? Feeling Stuck,"Hello all,

I am a female sophomore student studying Computer Science at a US state university. I'm looking for advice regarding how I should move forward with research in my next few years of college.

I have been involved in research since last summer, and I largely enjoy the process as someone who loves to learn. I have been in two labs; although I was making considerable progress and producing viable data while working with the first lab, I ultimately decided to transfer to my current lab because I thought their work aligned better with my future career interests and the work environment was better (I would have someone to shadow; in my first lab, the only person I worked with was my professor, and he was mostly absent since he was busy). However, I'm not so sure if I should stay anymore. What I am trying to figure out is whether I am truly disinterested in the topic, or if it's more due to my experience with this lab so far that has both failed to meet my personal expectations and expectations that any researcher would have.

*(\*Note: I have a TL;DR at the end in case you'd like a summary instead)*

I'd like to point out before I go on that I am not intentionally ""research lab hopping"" for more letters of recommendation. In fact, it's quite the opposite--I wish I could find and stay with the ""right"" lab because it is time consuming to become trained for and accustomed to different research. I'm more concerned with finding the right fit in terms of career interests because I intend to go on to graduate school and I'm still trying to figure out what I'd like to specialize in. ""PI/lab personality"" matches are also important for me to ensure I'll work well and effectively with my PI and fellow lab members. On the other hand, I feel that, from what I've read on academic Reddit forums, to find an almost perfect match is to strike gold in our current academic environment, so maybe this is all wishful thinking.

**Reasons for Wanting to Leave:** (not exhaustive; just a few reasons) 

1. I don't feel like a valued member of the research lab. When I first joined the lab, I wanted to become more involved right away in not just their research endeavors, but also their community outreach events, so I offered to assist even though it meant going out of my way (it wasn't great timing because I had a narrow window between classes). I showed up early, as my PI requested, to get trained with the equipment, but they ran out of time to train me and then told me they didn't need my help anymore. I even asked if I could help relocate equipment for them, but they made it clear they didn't need help. There are other times in which I was asked to help, showed up, did some work, but was dismissed in the end (I won't talk about them in detail to avoid revealing my identity). I realize that these events are important for our lab because they are crucial chances to showcase our work and potentially receive grant funding or attention from companies for partnerships, but if our PI and more experienced lab members are never going to allow newer members a chance to help (and maybe make small mistakes because that is a part of the learning process), how can we become better researchers? It makes me feel devalued and discouraged, and moreover, like dead weight.
2. There aren't many opportunities for me to get my questions answered without a short reply of ""look it up on Google"" or ""ask your partner."" To provide some context, I'm one of those students who rarely asks questions without first trying on my own and researching online. At this point, I still don't necessarily have the background knowledge to understand some of the articles/forums I find, which is when I ask questions toward my partner, and then PI. Unfortunately, my partner is currently a senior undergrad, so although he has a little more experience than I do, most of the time he also does not know the answer--and I don't expect him to because he is not a graduate student. When I ask my PI, he tells me to ask my partner to show or explain to me. I feel stuck because I cannot flat out tell my PI that my partner isn't always helpful because it would be throwing him under the bus when he hasn't necessarily done anything wrong. Considering that I left the first lab for a better ""support system"" in which I could work under a more experienced student, this frustrates me a lot.
3. This one is connected to point #2. My PI gets visibly frustrated and upset when my partner and/or I do not understand something, so now both of us are sometimes scared to ask for help. We know that our PI is hard on his students, but some encouragement (not necessarily the hand-holding kind) would be more beneficial as an unsure researcher. Sometimes I feel that he's disappointed in me or that he doesn't like me, but of course, I don't think that's necessarily true. I'd just rather be in a more nurturing environment where I don't need to constantly question his opinion of me. 
4. My workspace isn't the most ideal. I'm usually required to sit on the ground for hours, which hurts my back. The space is really small, so we can't arrange for alternative seating. My alternative workspace is not in the same building, so I can't do substantial work there.
5. My research has been going slowly, and my PI also pointed it out. I realize that research is supposed to be slow, but my progress almost makes me feel like I'm not cut out for this specific research topic (\*cue impostor syndrome\*), especially compared to the progress I made on the other research project over the summer. However, I need to put this into perspective because during the summer, I was working 40 hrs/week, and I've only been able to dedicate &lt;7 hrs/week during the school year toward this project.
6. I still haven't received sufficient onboarding training specific to my project. My PI sends broader information for all his students at the lab to review, but none of it is specific to my project, so I need to look to Google for help.
7. While our projects are practical, I feel that the work that I do won't impact as many people as I'd prefer. It's not to say that I think my lab's work is superfluous, it's more that our lab's mission doesn't align exactly with my personal goals. I want to feel that I'm doing as much good as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I Would Stay:**

* PI is empathetic toward students. He recognizes the importance of mental health and encourages students to occasionally take time off for self-care. This is important for me because I do have pre-existing mental health issues, and his attitude makes me feel safer in our lab environment. I know that some professors don't necessarily hold the same beliefs, and I'm just a little tired of having to figure that out the hard way.
* His lab is a great way for me to combine my interdisciplinary interests, which is why I joined in the first place. However, I just don't know if this is the right lab to explore those interests anymore.
* PI is willing to fund my research work so I don't need to look for an additional job. I can focus on research.
* I'm anxious about finding a new lab. The professors that I did enjoy taking courses with are not in my major. It's not to say that I didn't enjoy my major-specific courses; it's more that they work with a different topic of interest within CS. If I cold-email professors just based on their research, I might end up with a professor that might be an even worse fit. Professors are also busy, so contacting them and looking for a new lab might take a long time. Staying with my current lab would work incredibly well with my personal timeline for beginning my thesis this Fall.   
Alternatively, I could ask to rejoin my first lab, but I don't think that will work, and it's not a lab environment I would want to work long-term in despite the progress I had.

&amp;#x200B;

***TL;DR:*** *I'm currently in a relatively ideal research lab environment, but I'm finding that I starting to lose interest in the research that we do. Not sure if this is because I am truly disinterested in the topic, or more because my experiences working with some of the lab members (including PI) has diminished my overall interest. I think it's definitely a mix of both. Should I stay, or should I look for a new lab that may end up to be an even worse fit with less benefits?*

&amp;#x200B;

If I stay with my current lab, I could suggest for a new project to work on, but I wouldn't even know where to begin searching for new ideas. Additionally, how would you suggest I discuss with my PI about my concerns?

&amp;#x200B;

 I would appreciate any advice! Thank you in advance, and for reading this far (if you did).",1,2020-03-11 08:47:56

I hope everyone is doing well during the quarantine/shelter-in-place. I know how difficult this time can be due to the rapid change to online classes and teaching. 

This year, I am conducting a senior thesis concerning mental health and communication. In light of recent events, there has been a lot of up and downs with students continuing their projects. 

My study happens to be online already, but the recruitment process has proven difficult. We usually have a pool of participants associated with the university; however, communicating with that organization has not been the easiest feat with the department also having to accommodate for COVID-19. 

My study is examining college students (ages approx. 18-25) and my study has been approved by my institution's IRB. I do not believe that I can recruit using mTurk because I need a student population. Does anyone have any recommendations for methods or software of recruiting participants during the time of COVID-19. 

tl; dr: The pandemic has made recruitment of participants for my survey difficult. Are there are recommendations for software or methods that could help me recruit college students for a questionnaire.

kepf9v,Special-Ad7748,t2_95hut8d0,(Grad Student) Need help discerning the progress report of my advisors,"Hey good people of r/askacademia.

I’m a 3rd year Neuroscience grad student. Had a bad quarter. I failed my quals and had a few rounds of failed experiments. Honestly this year has been a wash. This quarter was a busy one for me. I...
1) wrote an Nrsa f31 proposal 
2) got married
3) studied for (and failed) oral quals
4) began writing a review paper on my own.

All this without a laptop, and financial and mental health struggles (been hitting up the local food bank each week but I know so many of us are in that same boat). Additionally, my family members cut me off for living with my fiancé before we got married.

Anyways it’s been a trying semester and tbh it’s taken every bit of energy I had just to hold myself together. Today my advisors were taking stock of my progress and aptitudes. They noted I have an aptitude for writing, but am not great at benchwork and my project.... well I can put all the data I have accrued from my entire PhD thus far on a single poster. They noted my habit of singularly focusing on one thing until it is finished and encouraged me to get more skilled at multitasking and working on things in parallel.

We are also scaling way back on the ambitions of my project. 

Maybe I’m a bit touchy because this quarter -and year- have been a lot, but I feel crushed, like I should master out and start a career elsewhere. I have a retake for my qualifying exam in a month and a half and the continued setbacks are draining my motivation and hopes of succeeding.

kg4rpr,LillFeather,t2_3fzr0js,Conflict with Dept Chair - Again,"Apologies in advance, but this is a long one. As the title indicates, I have recently had a major conflict with my department chair. This is not the first time it has happened, and both times had to do with me asking questions about his course which I am teaching on.


Background on the course: this is an Introduction to European Literature course for 1st year students who then have to decide of they want to continue to study literature at all (so about half of any class is entirely uninterested in literature at all). Half the group is international and taught through English, the other half is taught through the local language. I teach that half.


My boss had revamped the course for this year and was very excited about the changes he'd made, but unlike the etiquette at this institution, he didn't inform or involve his teaching team at all at any point. This meant that everything was sprung on the teaching team last minute. This is where the first conflict came from: he released the mandatory texts a week before the seminars started, and for week 1 chose an article which I see as too difficult (and honestly ill-fitting, but I didn't say that), especially for my students who don't do the course through English. I contacted him about this and explained my concerns, making it clear that I understood we couldn't change the text anymore and instead asking for help in making it accessible for my students. The result was a stream of aggressive messages about how, as I am ""so young"" and still new to the job (1st academic job post-PhD, started last year) I obviously don't understand anything, ending with the setting of a disciplinary meeting the next day. He then spent the entire meeting smiling and telling me I'm so talented etc. and that he's just worried about me self sabotaging by worrying unnecessarily and ""giving the students ammunition"" before the course even began.


The second conflict was this week. He asked me to check the translations of the exam. I noticed that some of the questions were from last year's exam and no longer fitted the content of the course, at least the way I had been teaching it. I will admit a mea culpa here that I had been confused by the new course design and instead of asking for help, decided to just do my best to do right by my students, and follow the instructions I got at my disciplinary meeting as well as the syllabus contents. I should have asked my boss for help during the course, but I honestly am scared to talk to him and hoped addressing the topics in the syllabus was sufficient. When I reached out to him at the end of the course and, mistakenly (another mea culpa), in the group chat for the teaching team for the course asked about these questions and if the content was present in the lectures (which my boss gives), as I had not focused on it in my seminars at all, he proceeded to belittle me and (between the lines) vaguely threaten me. This was another incessant stream of messages full of screenshots proving just how wrong I was, again, in the group chat ""in front of"" my colleagues. I will not go into details about what was said out of fear of being identified, but it came across as extremely vitriolic. I got defensive and the conversation ended there.
Also, although I understand that I may not be in the right here and everyone in this department is doing their best just to get by, it has been extremely hurtful to have received no private messages from my colleagues who witnessed this - not to say I'm right, but at least to check if I'm okay.


After cooling down a little I decided the best course of action would be to send a long apology email to soothe the situation. I am not sorry at all, but I am very concerned about my career. Me getting this job was nothing short of a miracle, and the way the system works here any progression in my career is fully dependent on him - I cannot apply for a promotion with my Faculty, he has to nominate me, and my job is temporary but can be made permanent, dependent on him, again. His answer to my email was lengthy, and although he was no longer angry it outraged me again. The typical ""I was not angry but shocked and disappointed"", together with a strange mixture of talking about how amazing and talented I am, together with him expressing concern about my insecurities which lead to defensiveness, and my social ineptitude leading to a failure to fit in with the department, with a dash of kind understanding that as an inexperienced and young person I am of course in a different position and he has done his best to take care of me and has (in his words) spoilt me, leading to anger and envy from senior colleagues. I have seen no evidence of this, and feel he's trying to manipulate me into being insecure with my colleagues instead of confiding in them.


I think I took the pressure off the situation for now, but I am looking for another position as this is entirely unsustainable and damaging my mental health. I, perhaps mistakenly, consider myself to be sensitive in some areas but very tough professionally, yet he has me terrified and walking om eggshells anytime I have to get into contact either with him or those in the group who are close to him. I have talked to some colleagues about this, and they agree that he's outrageous, so it is nice to know that this is not some kind of hypersensitivity on my end - but it does not take away the creeping sensation that my boss is a bully and to involve HR or even just to tell him about how his behaviour towards me is inappropriate and damaging me would end my career here. A step I might have been willing to take, if there were any positions available elsewhere.


I love my job. I love teaching (not always and not as much as I have to, but still), I love research, and I dearly miss going for coffee with my colleagues or chatting with them at the office. Because of this I am deeply worried, and it is starting to affect me, especially being in lockdown. Since puberty I have not felt as deeply insecure as after his latest email to me. Am I being gaslit, or am I right even with the mistakes I have made? A tough question for people without the full context I am sure, so perhaps more of a rhetorical one, but one that plagues me nonetheless. I have not heard of any other colleagues being treated like this (the golden child who is also an idiotic piece of shit), but tbh I do not think anyone else ever questions him. I know I should dissociate and, as a colleague adviced me, ""fly under the radar"", but I don't know how to do that. I guess I am looking for a place to vent and get advice on how to get by in this volatile situation.


TL;DR I suspect I'm in an abusive relationship with my boss, who my career depends on entirely for now. What can I do to survive this situation, as I love academia and - aside from him - my job?",1,2020-12-19 09:23:05
kghfwg,sorry_scared_student,t2_6awgs4ne,Academic misconduct - consequences?,"Sorry if this doesn't belong on this subreddit. Throwaway for obvious reasons. It's a long one because I feel guilty and want to get it off my chest.

\--

I graduated from a UK university with an integrated Master's degree (MSci) in July this year. My mental health had been declining ever since my second year, but really nose-dived just before the first UK COVID lockdown, when I was working on my final research project. I had to rush to get what little results I could before the uni closed, as I would not be allowed to return before my deadline - I actually had to sneak into the lab the day after it closed to weigh the very, very few samples I had. However, the weighing balances were completely messed up - presumably from a very recent move between labs - and I couldn't get them to work properly. I panicked and measured what I could, but for one result I was getting a negative reading whatever I did, despite it having visible mass. In my stressed/anxious fog, **I wrote a random, potentially-plausible-but-maybe-not number down and not the actual number I was getting**.

Once I snapped out of it, I freaked out, because obviously this is falsification, i.e. academic misconduct and just bad unethical science. What then made it worse was that my anxious/depressive spiral got so bad, I basically did nothing for the next 3 months, then wrote my entire dissertation and recorded my seminar in the 4 days before the deadline, without sleeping and only fueled by caffeine... meaning I didn't remember that I falsified the result until a while after, and **it was a fairly large focus of my writing.**

Somehow I passed everything, so I was awarded my degree and got a good grade. I spent the last 6 months working on my health and now I'm thinking about finding a job and moving on. However, recently it hit me out of the blue - **my supervisor kept my samples** **and has my lab-book and disso for her records**, so if she ever decided she wanted to check what I'd done (if a bit unlikely, because she should remember it was a hot mess from start to finish and my results certainly don't mean anything), she would be able to tell it's fishy (on the massive assumption my non-falsified results match what she weighs them as) and do something about it.

If she finds out, what are the most probable consequences going to be?

\--

**TL;DR - in a moment of complete stupidity, I falsified one of my results, and it significantly affected how I wrote my MSci dissertation. My supervisor could potentially prove it if she was ever inclined to, and I am worried about the consequences, however unlikely.**

**Is this something that could potentially get my degree classification changed or even revoked? Or is it too small-scale to be worth worrying about?**

(I know it's just an undergrad paper and will never have even the slightest impact on the scientific community, but I feel really guilty about being a bad scientist. I also have no intention of pursuing a PhD at all (not just because of this though) and while I'm tentatively looking at industry grad schemes/science-adjacent jobs, I'm perfectly willing to take an office job and never look at another scientific paper again.)",1,2020-12-19 22:10:18
kkp4g0,Mysterious-Memory-73,t2_1rz7fs5t,Taking a leave of absence from the PhD due to mental illness,"Hi all,

I'm in my second-year of a humanities PhD at a top-ranked university in Canada. I've struggled with mental illness throughout my entire life (diagnosed bipolar disorder) and feel as if my health has just gotten worse during this program and especially during the pandemic. I've dealt with these issues before, including having had to take a few months off during my undergraduate studies after being hospitalized. I really thrived during the MA, but I think that was in part because less was expected of me than during the PhD and there was a clear end in sight (my MA program was only 12 months whereas average time to completion of my PhD program is over 7 years and often goes beyond the guaranteed funding period).

Over the past year and a half, I've noticed I've been ignoring my mental well-being in order to keep up with constant deadlines, research, writing, TAing and RAing duties, administrative responsibilities, etc. and that I am just burning out and am not sure if finishing this program is even worth it (especially considering I've been doubting recently if I want to be in academia). I think it might be in my best interest to take a leave of absence for a semester or two in order to get my shit together. I've already finished coursework and would take time off after I complete my qualifying field exams in the summer. I would be ABD at this point. 

TL;DR: Basically, I was wondering if there were those out there who took a LOA (especially because of mental illness) and what you did during your time off, and ultimately why or why didn't you decide to return to the PhD program?",1,2020-12-26 20:18:34

I am not gonna make a throwaway account because honestly I am not embarassed of this episode in my life. I don't know if this is the correct place to ask about this though.

I was in 2nd year in my college when I suffered from a sexual assault leading to me suffering from severe PTSD. I have had minor Dissosciative Identity disorder from my childhood due to highly volatile surroundings in my home and this assault from someone I trusted broke me completely. I went into isolation and it took me 3 years to come back to college and graduate. 

So this is my question. If I go for interviews whether government / private, should I tell them about my mental health issues if they ask me about the extension? Or should I say I was suffering from health issues.


What would you do in my position? 
Is it okay to tell interviewer that you have/ had mental trauma?

So, my previous semester was online and it sucked. I wasn't as much as productive as I thought it would be. It was very hectic and I lost my mental health in the final days as a result of which I kind of screwed my final exams. I got free on 4th of December but ever since that I have been feeling guilty of not doing enough or learning enough in my previous semester.

 I thought I'll just revise whatever I didn't learn then or I'll just start prepping up for the next semester in the December break alongwith some pending things such as meeting up with friends/watching pending movies/getting house repaired and what not.

Turns out that I could not get anything done apart from getting the house repaired. That task was done in around a week. Rest of the time I just stayed in my room on social media and procrastinating.

Now, December is done and my classes for next semester starts tomorrow. Now, I regret about not spending enough time with my friends or family and just wasting most of December.

I've noticed that this is a cycle. This happens around every summer/winter break and the following semester.

How do I deal with or get rid of these feelings? Please Help.

But, it turns out that I simply set myself up for failure since I was failing in like half of my classes, not doing so well in my internship and I wasn't maintaining communication with my research advisor. Most of this was due to election anxiety (I am an Internation Student so a Trump presidency would have been it for my dreams in the US) and also poor mental health in this seemingly endless quarantine. However, Biden being elected was a glimmer of hope and I was able to correct course in almost all of my courses and was also able to become productive at my internship however, I did not communicate with my research advisor at all. 

Basically, I have lowered my course load for this spring semester and I am able to manage my time at the internship and I have found ways to lower my anxiety as well. I want to reach out to my advisor to start on a Research project but I don't know how to do that. Can you guys please advise me as to what I should do. 

I forgot to say this but the project that I was working on at the start with my research advisor wasn't what I liked but i thought that maybe sticking with it will turn out ok but it didn't. I think my advisor/professor gave me a small project because I was taking the Upper level Machine Learning class but I have finished that class now and got an A. 

So, with all of this in mind can you guys suggest to me how I should contact her and how I can ask for a project that about Machine Learning and is actually interesting.",1,2021-01-05 17:37:05
k16zk3,ManicSheep,t2_80ct6kus,Tenure Track is slowly killing me. Need a mentor,"TL;DR: On a 2.5 year tenure track. Doing my best, which is not good enough. Stressed/Anxious all the time and feel insecure. Tenure review is in 3 months. Don't think I'll make it before then without getting a breakdown. Desperately needing a mentor :(


I am 35m, and in a niche sub discipline of psychology.

I moved from my home country as an Associate Professor (really cosy job) to a European Country. I took up an Assistant professor position and the changed to a tenure track. Been here 4.5 years now (on the tenure track for 1.5). Due to local labour legislation they could only offer me a 2.5 year track (where others have 5). Just note that my residency here is dependent upon my academic position.

The tenure criteria is really vague, and applied differently to different people. Where one got tenure with 3 publications, 1 PhD competed and 200k in grant money (with no academic citizenship), and another with 30 publications in 5 years, 2 PhDs and 50k in grants didn't.

Since jumping on this position I've been working my self to the bone. 18 to 20 hour work days (6 days a week) have become the norm. I've been quite successful with publications so far (12 papers published, 7 in review, 12 chapters, 3 edited books, 3 special issues etc) with an ok h-index (18), teaching Im putting in alot of effort and get high ratings (4.2/5), completed around 23 master theses and 13 bachelor ones. I'm also an associated editor for three journals and do a bunch of other external stuff. Grants less lucky... Only one big one of 155k and then a few smaller ones when I need them. My single PhD student is on track but his language capability is holding him back. Anyway I digress... Basically I'm doing alot (5 to 7 times more than others in my department on my level). 

The problem is the bar keeps moving and the subjective requirements keep changing. Nothing that I do seems to be good enough, and then I put in more hours and work longer to meet them. Like all.of a sudden we have a list of 5 journals we may publish in (all of which are unrelated to my sub-discipline), my teaching load increased significantly both due to corona and that my other colleagues didn't want to teach X course anymore (Also refused to..share any content of the course so I had to generate things from scratch)... So it was given to me. The funding I have to bring in has increased from 50k per year to 150k (o and where I am really good at getting companies to fund my project's.... This doesn't count!) etc. So nothing I do is good enough.

When I have interim performance discussions with my line manager there is no appreciation for what I do (Also for the department) and it's always about what I should do differently.

On top of this is the fear attached to being kicked out of the country because my visa is attached to the position. 

The stress and anxiety anxiety caused by all of this keeps me awake every night. The 4 hours I have to sleep each night... Is filled with restlessness and nightmares. This tenure track thing has made me feel so useless and insecure about myself. 

I have to submit my tenure documents in January and there isn't much I can do at this moment anymore. Usually there is also a mentor assigned to Tenure Trackers to help check documents and applications and things... And this also hadn't happened (I think corona got everyone distracted).

So I'm not sure what to do. But my mental health had taken a massive toll since starting on this journey. Don't think I'll make it till January without having a massive breakdown.

Seeing that I am not sure what this tenure review process involves, but I have to submit like Documents and reflections on things... I just wish I could test my things with someone. Not sure where or how to look for a mentor :(

Sorry for the long post. Just needed to get this out.",1,2020-11-26 02:58:01
krssds,goose_talon,t2_4y430alh,Editor determines a reviewers to be unnecessarily harsh,"Hey all,

I am a recently minted PhD in organismal biology (USA). I graduated in August after having to work outrageously hard to prove myself to my absent yet hyper critical advisor. See backstory [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/f0fyhs/phd_advisor_left_for_8_months_not_sabbatical_and/) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/fwu7x4/i_feel_really_bad_about_my_phd_thesis_esp_now/) Since posting that about a year ago, 3 of the MSc students quit the lab and the advisor has still not returned from abroad (of course citing COVID, but still).  He has no more active students that I am aware of.

In any case, I have published 3 of my chapters from my dissertation and I recently submitted the 4th. I have two more in prep. I say this not to brag, but to emphasize how unnecessarily critical my advisor was about my work and productivity. I received expert feedback on this 4th chapter from multiple external colleagues and mentors and was strongly encouraged by my new PI (a very reputable and established scientist with whom I am doing my postdoc) to submit the paper.  I submitted to a mid range journal, nothing flashy, but considered good.

I submitted this as the sole author because my advisor did not wish to be listed as an author.  This one chapter we disagreed on considerably, and I was left to do the entirety of the project with very minimal support from him. While I do think some of his critiques are valid, it is also somewhat outside of his scope, and I fully believe that I addressed his critiques in the text of the paper.

After a fairly long wait, I finally received the decision from the editor. There were 3 reviewers, and 2 of the three were kinda outrageous. They used words like ""horrible,"" ""disappointing,"" ""over ambitious,"" and mostly had ad hominem rather than scientific feedback. Almost nothing they said was constructive. They both voted to the reject the paper.  The third reviewer was the opposite -- very supportive, incredibly detailed and constructive comments, and edits which amounted to minor revisions.

The editor determined ""Major Revisions"" and said that the paper was absolutely suitable for publication in the journal and described reviewers 1 and 2 as ""unduly harsh"" and unconstructive.

The thing is, because of the small size of the field, I am able to guess who all of the reviewers are. Reviewer number 1 is an old riend/colleague of my advisor. He was actually on my my PhD committee until he quit a month before my defense, unapologetically, and told my advisor it was because I positively reviewed a paper that he rejected!!

Reviewer number 2 is also an old colleague/friend of my advisor. He was not as harsh but as #1 but was also ad hominem and dismissive.

Reviewer number 3 is a younger scientist and colleague of mine. He has no conflict of interest in this paper being published, and in fact has even said that he had a similar idea for a project! so if anything, there some level of competition between us. We are both on the job market in an extremely small field.

When reading the reviews of #1 in particular, he used the same exact language as my advisor and it leads me to believe that he consulted my advisor on this review.  I do not believe it was a coincidence because the parallels are just uncanny. This makes me believe that my advisor is actively sabotaging my work.

While I am extremely grateful that reviewer 3 was scientific in their review, and that the editors were able to see through the unscientific approach by reviewers 1 and 2, I am still left feeling incredibly anxious, disappointed, and concerned for my future in this small field.  My mental health really suffered under my advisor in the last year of my PhD and this is dredging up all of those feelings.

I suppose I am asking for advice from anyone who may have been through a similar situation?  I'm guessing there is nothing I can really do, but its just a troubling situation. I fear that this could be a constant problem for me whenever I attempt to publish without the \~ blessing \~ of the old guard.

I am considering the following programs:

* Master's in Public Health (MPH) with a focus in health policy and management
* Masters in Health Informatics (MHI)
* Masters in Healthcare Administration

hezess,medschoool,t2_70rpi3dd,Political Science PhD or Medicine,"Over the past two months, I’ve realised that doing a PhD in political science and working in academia is probably my ideal career path. My previous degrees are in economics which makes me miserable. I greatly enjoy academic debate, following research and discussing it etc and came to this conclusion after realising that most people I look up to or want to aspire to be like have PhDs. However, I have mental health issues and I really need structure in my life and I often get really depressed about how little I have accomplished. I have a place in a PhD programme in Singapore that doesn’t appear to be valued very highly anywhere. I would like to reapply to somewhere better but I don’t think my chances are good because I lack research experience (I took a lot of research classes but didn’t actually do any research so I know the theory and know how I’d R, STATA and Python but not in a research setting) and I’m not happy with the current offer. Furthermore, I am not excited about having to teach at all. I also feel a lot of uncertainty about getting into a PhD programme and also about the job market and getting an academic job when I graduate. Ideally, I’d like to work in Canada to be close to my family.

In comparison, I have been interested in medicine for most of my life and have a few offers as well but they’re really expensive so I don’t want to commit unless I’m really sure. I have access to some of the curriculum and I loved some of it and sometimes it made me wonder why I spent all of undergrad and masters in social sciences when I could have been doing this (I had the option after high school but decided not to back then). I am not as quick and it doesn’t feel as natural as social science but I do feel sort of at peace. I am, however, a ridiculously self critical person so I do find myself second guessing sometimes. I second guess whether the clinical aspect about interacting with patients is suitable for me which is obviously the most important part. Most significantly, I really started second guessing myself during COVID-19 as I don’t see myself as some kind of hero that sacrifices themselves to save lives and started feeling scared, not excited about running to the hospital to help in every way I could. Medicine does seem ‘more worth it with mental peace’ to me although not ‘a perfect  match but with a lot of anxiety and uncertainty’ that I would consider a political science PhD.",1,2020-06-24 11:32:03

I think there are a lot of other factors that weigh in to either option. However, a huge priority for me is mental health. After doing this master’s I just do not feel mentally stable and I am concerned that a PhD would worsen my mental health. For example, I am writing an essay and it is utter torture. I am sort of questioning my commitment to writing and especially academic writing...Is this necessary for me to research? Do I really have something to say? Or am I merely just interested in reading theory for pleasure? 

I am truly considering whether or not having an employable degree from somewhere like a T14 law school would be a better option for me. But again, I have heard the job market for law is horrible and to what extent is this true in comparison to a humanities PhD?

I understand that neither are perfect options because there are corresponding financial or opportunity costs for each one. But alas, if faced with this decision what are the pros and cons for either/or? Or what questions should I be asking and considering so that I can figure this out?",1,2020-06-26 02:09:05
hi8q6r,ktitts,t2_3377ybik,What else can I do? (Job Search),"I graduated last spring with a BA in Psychology. I really want to go into neuroscience, and realize getting a BA wasn't exactly the right track to go on. I'm now almost finished with my MS in psych. I'm a first gen college student, so I really didn't know what I was getting into. It wasn't until junior year I realized my passion for neuropsychology. That being said, I was only able to squeeze in an advanced chem lab and a physiology lab. So my lab experience is present, but pretty small. I also went to a small liberal arts school, so not sure if it holds much ground.   


I was published, and presented my research at a conference. I did an internship at a mental health hospital, and did independent research with faculty. All of these experiences are more social psychology directed, so not sure if they really hold weight.   


I guess what I'm wondering is...will I ever get into any lab assistant positions that aren't social psychology? I've applied to over 40 labs across the US in the past 9 months intermittently with no takes. Did I literally screw myself by not doing more scientific lab work in my undergrad? Is there anything else I can do? I really want to apply to PhD programs in the next year but fear I won't have recommendation letters from a lab that can back me up.

kamz9z,Ok_Currency_6191,t2_7erx1fqp,Transphobia in academia? How to handle?,"Hi,

I am ftm trans and attending college for the third time (dropped out twice) and I'm wondering how to address the transphobia I've been experiencing? I am a part of a scholarship that meets weekly for a project and the group i am in consistently uses my dead name as a joke. In the same weekly meetings, I've been deadnamed by other students and referred to as she/her or a girl, even by the professor. The professor called me a woman and used she/her for me, and apologized and has never slipped again. However, my groupmates who i work with consistently and talk to every day almost, will call me a girl or use she/her and have made jokes about my deadname. This is not the only circumstance that i have come across while attending this school. When i first got accepted I went to ask if there was a way to use a nickname for my classes as I did not want to be called my birth name (i have not petitioned for a change of name yet which is also a part of my real name). I have been able to do this in my previous college and wanted to see if it would be possible here. However I was faced with a lot of hostility and anger from the lady at the front desk who demanded i show proof. overall my experience has been uncomfortable, save for the few understanding professors. However, the whole scholarship thing has really been taking a toll on my mental health. I feel like i'm crazy for feeling upset about this and that i shouldn't bring it up. However, i don't want these people to think i'm okay with them using my dead name as a joke or that it's fine for them to continuously use wrong pronouns. I'm a pretty understanding person when it comes to these things too, I try to be patient and understanding as possible but it feels personal at this point. We've been meeting for months now, consistently, and I am presenting masc. I feel like if it were not for my legal name being displayed all over my online classes, i might not have these problems, however theres no way I can change that, especially not now. anyways, any help or advice is helpful. please let me know. thank you .",1,2020-12-10 20:07:20
k9goun,standcam,t2_11skcp,[Advice Request] Anyone ever experienced co-authors who are using their seniority/authority to block paper submissions?,"Hey all

I have a dilemma here that is costing me quite a lot of sleep/my mental health and I'm not sure what I should do in this situation:

During my PhD (3.5 years in UK) I produced drafts of 4 first author papers. 2 were published in reasonable journals (Impact Factor 5-10) before I had my PhD defense. Now (as a postdoc in another university) I am really struggling to publish the other 2 drafts. The reason I am struggling is because my supervisor insists that I work with the 2 co-authors (one of whom have also moved from my PhD group) on the paper drafts due to their superior experience in the field, as they have each been in the area for nearly 15 years. However both co-authors keep using any means possible to delay any of their contributions to the paper, with excuses such as teaching, exam marking, Covid etc. In the last 3 years or so since defending my PhD I have majorly revised the drafts for both papers almost 5-6 times each and sent them to the co-authors, only for them to virtually neglect the drafts each time despite responding to me via email that they'd work on it which they of course never follow through with. I have like 20 emails in which they have promised to look at the paper and return a draft to me in 2 weeks but most certainly never follow through with. 

I believe under normal circumstances I could  - as first author - simply submit without any input from them seeing as I've given them enough opportunity to voice their feedback; however this is where things get complicated: **My PhD supervisor has forbidden me from submitting the papers without input from both co-authors, despite knowing all the above about how they have delayed looking at the papers.** Disobeying my PhD supervisor could put my career/reputation in danger given how highly reputed he is within my field. (I've seen several colleagues - PhDs and postdocs - have their careers heavily jeopardised as a result of submitting papers without permission from the supervisor and as a result straining their professional relationship). Unfortunately, since both my co-authors have tenure/a large publication record already they are under less pressure to publish and so getting them to even look at my paper/give any feedback is impossible. I have been patient with them all these years and been as polite as I can - and even at one point tried to offer co-first-authorship to one of them in an attempt to get them to prioritise this paper more - but nothing has worked and they have barely even budged. It is driving me crazy that they are clearly too happy to damage my publication record - for which each first author paper makes a significant difference at this stage in my research career - just because the papers do not affect them much. Seriously, I have always been polite and co-operative towards them, I really cannot understand their intentions.

Does anyone have any suggestions please what I should do in this circumstance? I am out of ideas as to how I can make sure these papers get out in time to avoid stunting my publication record, and at the same time not destroying my professional relationship with my supervisor/co-authors? (I need the former as a referee for any further postdoc applications.)

(I do also have 2 first authors and 2 second authors from my 3 year postdoc - a lone project btw - which I am nearing the end of, but I feel like these two papers are going to be wasted otherwise if they are not published soon.) 

Stay safe, everyone.",1,2020-12-09 00:19:30

j2ty3o,unofficial_supergirl,t2_3a6hbkki,Am I doing the right thing?,"
Hi Academics,

Firstly I'm really sorry for how long this post is, and if I'm in the wrong subreddit to ask- but I hope you have time to read it and offer some advice.

I'm struggling a little bit, as I don't have many people to ask for help regarding this. My own parents aren't great, and I've grown up in a really toxic, emotionally abusive household which resulted in quite a significant anxiety disorder. My mum has suspected (undiagnosed due to how mental healthcare works here) bipolar disorder, and comes from a really shallow and narrow minded family herself. My dad is a boat steadier and has a tendency to completely ignore anything that isn't pandering to my mum, thus letting her get away with a lot. To compound things, I also have a profoundly disabled brother, whom I adore and I also count him as one of my best friends, but it is a difficult situation with caring for him as well as being in a crap place with my parents. We do get a lot of community support and help, and whilst my parents are great to my brother, they have nothing left to give to the rest of us. My older brother pretty much abandoned us when he could, and my older sister moved back in with her children after escaping an abusive relationship. As you can imagine, home is an intense place and I pretty much brought myself up due to the unintended neglect that resulted from the pressures on my parents of having a disabled child- but this means I often don't have anyone to go to for advice so I hope to find some here.

Last summer I graduated from my Bachelors Degree in Geography, and I focussed my dissertation on disability inclusive disaster risk reduction (a mouthful, I know). This is an area I'm really keen to go into, as I have experience with my brother and I'm really passionate about social inclusion and safety for all. I managed to do fairly well at university, even though my brother was really poorly and at times it was touch and go, my dad had a double heart bypass, and my mum frequently abandoned us to travel for long periods of time. I studied away from home but I came home pretty much every weekend to cook and clean and generally hold things down. Obviously with Covid, university was suspended and I graduated in absentia as we were all asked to go home. At home, things deteriorated as cabin fever set in, with my mum and dad turning really nasty and horrible to me and my sister.

This meant that I applied for a postgraduate masters course under a lot of stress, and it was an absolute miracle that I was accepted. My undergraduate supervisors and tutors were really keen for me to pursue postgraduate study, and even discussed my potential willingness to go on to a PhD, as my goal is to work in developing inclusive policy at regional, national, and maybe one day international scales however I recognise I lack significant skills and qualifications to get me on that career path. Pre-Covid, I was accepted to work as a retail stock manager at a world sporting event which unfortunately was cancelled and my contract rescinded, but the money and prestige earned from working in this role would have significantly financed the living costs associated with my masters. Of course with covid and having immunocompromised family members, it's not as though I can just go out and work which is what I would ordinarily do, but doing so would put my brother's health at risk and I can't face even balancing the risk of losing the only family member I have a good relationship with yet. I had really wanted to move out again for my masters, but as teaching is mostly remote, I can't justify the costs of moving and renting with the limited funds I have available.

In order to circumvent this, I've been emailing charities and organisations that may have contacts who can point me towards bursaries or beneficiaries, but I'm really struggling to have any financial luck. I was approved a loan by Student Finance, but as it goes in the UK, it just about covers tuition and leaves very little on which you can cover the costs of additional things such as textbooks, travelling for labs, and just general existence. I would like to know where I'm going wrong, so I'm pasting a template of what I use and adapt for each individual organisation (after I research and personalise to ensure it's bespoke) that I contact regarding any funding. 

I also wonder if I'm being too big headed and arrogant, and if it is presumptuous to think I am even worth someone going, do you know what, let's give her some money to pull her through. I think that may be low self esteem and self worth associated with my anxiety, but I am actually concerned as my parents often call me arrogant and self entitled. I don't even know if going ahead with postgraduate education is even a good idea considering everything that is currently happening, and if I've overestimated my abilities and capacities. 

Conversely, I do think that if I secured a small bursary to put towards the costs, it would stand me in very good stead if I do go ahead with applying for a PhD- and most importantly, whilst many organisations haven't been able to offer funding or bursaries, I have been offered two fantastic volunteering roles on projects that help children who are classified as young carers as I myself was. I did a lot of volunteering for vulnerable young people pre-pandemic, and I really missed being able to do so which means that these organisations have offered me one lifeline in that I can actually do something even if it's over zoom and not necessarily in person. 

I guess what I'm asking for is some reassurance and advice on what I could do to improve my messages, or maybe if people knew organisations that may be able to help? Or, if any of you were in situations similar to mine and how you overcame it. 



The email template I use: 

I am writing to you to enquire whether you have any information regarding scholarships, bursaries, or sponsors that are available to young adult carers. I have recently been accepted a place at the University -------  to study an MSc in ----------, having completed my undergraduate degree in Geography at the University -------- .
 
My interests stemmed from having been a carer for my profoundly disabled younger brother since I was five years old. As I grew older and more involved in his care needs, I was struck by the extent of the inaccessibility in our lived environments. By my early teens, I had significant caring responsibilities for my brother to the detriment of my own education. My school attendance rate was 60% due to these responsibilities, and yet I developed a sense of injustice at the battle we fought to get my brother his statutory right to formal education. I contributed to essential meetings of adults at tables with my feet barely touching the floor. My contributions were simultaneously instrumental to the recognition of his needs, and dismissed by the very people who did not allow me to the child I should have been. This battle catalysed my teenage activism, leading to years of campaigning, volunteering, and fundraising through my distinct lens and experiences as a young carer.
 
Being an aware campaigner stimulated my interest in environmental issues and spurred me to my degree in Geography at the University --------, which focused my interest in the complex relationship between human society and our physical habitat. There is increasing recognition that greater resilience and sustainability against climate instability is necessary. However, the means to do so is reserved for the privileged with education, material resources, and crucially, without disabilities. Continuing upheavals such as the current COVID-19 pandemic highlight the importance of planning and international cooperation.
 
At ---------, in between coming home to look after my brother and mum on weekends, I developed a specific interest in disability inclusive disaster risk reduction, which I subsequently researched in my undergraduate dissertation. My interest in accessibility, as well as my grades in certain modules made me stand out to my lecturers, who encouraged me to continue pursuing my academic career and guided me to this taught masters at the University ---------, in the hopes that I would gain the additional skills needed to continue onto a PhD specialising in disability inclusive disaster risk reduction. This is an area of growing importance and relevance to our lives, not simply due to the widely recognised uncertainties within climate change, but also the growing global and regional instabilities worldwide.
 
My aspiration is to work in inclusive policy making, as I want to use my capabilities to compensate for the lack of disability-inclusion in disaster risk reduction, considering the multifaceted issues we are facing. Studying at the --------- would give me the opportunity to further refine the research skills I gained from the University --------- in a field more relevant to my interests. As you can understand, the lack of research in this area, my experience as a carer, and my interests in filling this research gap puts me in the unique position of having the potential to do so. Whilst the drive and the recognition is there, the financial burden of doing so may be a preventative factor. I have taken the maximum post graduate student loan available, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and my parents’ own financial concerns in the economic upheavals, I am keen to find additional scholarships, bursaries, or sponsors if there are any available. This would make it a lot easier to continue my work as an unpaid carer, as well as developing my academic contributions towards ensuring the safety and security of people with disabilities in disaster situations.",1,2020-09-30 20:23:59

I am currently in my third semester at AUB (American University of Beirut) in Lebanon pursuing a master's degree in English language (linguistics). it is the best university in the region and has a reputation internationally. I got a 100% scholarship and this is why I entered this program. 

I must say that I knew the program was weak and nothing like what I want, but it was a great opportunity and in my country, options are almost non-existent. 

I have been having breakdowns and increased anxiety and frustration since last fall, but now it has gotten to an all-time high. I feel like a zombie and im doing the worst academic performance in my academic history. I stopped caring about quality and I just want to submit things and get them over with. it is worth mentioning that around last fall, a revolution in my country started, coupled with an economic crisis, and now we are all on lockdown due to Corona. I feel like I finally exploded and hit rock bottom.

Today during online class, we had a peer-review on our lit. reviews and mine needs the most work and rewriting. I literally muted my mic and started crying right away in the middle of the class just thinking about having to re-do it. this is where I completely broke down and I am seriously considering dropping out. I am so confused because I am in my third semester, so I still have a semester and a thesis, but I really don't know if I can keep going. 

I discovered that I don't really want to do linguistics as a career and noticed that I am much more interested in sociology and anthropology. I am now taking a break to weigh my options and see whether:

1- I should start a new bachelor's degree in social sciences in my country or abroad

2- I should stay and continue my master's (at the expense of my mental health)

3- I finish the courses and try to do my thesis abroad? (I highly doubt that would be manageable)

and these are just what came to my mind directly. 

I am not even sure I want to do a Ph.D anytime soon. I feel like this whole experience made me discover that I don't want to spend my life in academia. it should be noted that my classmates are also bothered by the pressure of the semesters but they seem to be interested in what they're doing and have their goals clear and grounded in academia.

I feel very alone in this and that no one understands, hell, I don't even understand, but all I know is that I want my career to be something that is social work oriented and do research that has impact on problem-solving in the real world. linguistics just doesn't do that. I love languages and im a linguistically intelligent person, but I discovered that I would prefer to read about it as a hobby and not as a career especially the research part of it. I am really lost and I feel stuck.

I would appreciate any tips or advice you can offer.",1,2020-03-18 18:10:31

I will try to keep this post as brief as possible because it is probably a busy time for most folks at this point in the semester. Basically, a cohort member in my year was recently absent for about three weeks due to mental health issues and a particular lab related incident with his advisor among other things. I recently saw this cohort member attend class remotely (my campus is one of those that lets people choose online or in person) without the camera on and had considered a possible ""welcome back"" message of sorts to them (singular ""they"" to keep gender anonymous). However, I am uncertain whether or not that would be the professional thing to do and if that sort of message would, even on a personal level, be considered acceptable because it would otherwise bring indirect attention to something they (singular) may otherwise wish to put aside. 

Another variable in all of this is that incident that spurred their mental health issues does (unfortunately) involve another person in my year as well and there is definitely a burned bridge with that particular member. In addition, this is our first semester in the program. I am worried that reaching out may affect ""diplomacy"" with this other cohort member if I do so. Even if there is a conversation with that member, I am worried about even the simplest small talk further straining the relations between all of us.

So far, it is clear to me that a literature review is a critical examination of literature written about a certain topic. In my case, the topic is *the effects of social media on mental health*. I already have my three sources which I will be reviewing. (All of them say that the effects of social media on mental health are negative) However, there are a few things I would like to know.

1) How do I write the introduction? Considering the literature review has to be around 600 words only, I want to keep my introduction as concise as possible. Do I introduce my sources and briefly summarize their findings in the introduction? Or should I just stick to introducing the topic itself?

2) Do I critically examine each source individually **or** do I examine the topic with help of the sources, like a mixed bag, criticizing the sources while doing so?

3) Any tips on writing a literature review this short, in general? It is possible to stretch the word count to 700-800 words (which I will probably do), but even then it is still on the short side IMO.

j6t8xe,VictoriaSobocki,t2_k9clm,"Seeking advice: PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Legal Disruption/AI/RoboLaw (25F, Denmark)","Hello everyone

Hope this is an OK place to ask.

I’m a 25 year old woman in Copenhagen, Denmark, and I’m currently doing my master’s degree in law school (at University of Copenhagen) and doing an AI course as my last elective course.

I wish to work in a game changing/revolutionary field and to shape the laws and policies of the future. I am interested in making a PhD project with futuristic relevance and of practical use – not “zero-research project” that will collect dust.

I’m thinking that several papers would be a good fit for this AI course, rather than a book/monograph.

I like researching things and would like to make an impact in the AI-legal field – and I have an excellent professor/possible PhD supervisor, who is super engaged/enthusiastic, intelligent and creative (I’ve heard this is important when making such a project).

I am already thinking of doing my master’s thesis in this course, so I will be working more with this professor than I have with other ones.  
 

**Here are my PhD questions and concerns:**

1. Is it a good idea with regards to the job market to do a PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Legal Disruption/AI/RoboLaw? (Course description: [https://kurser.ku.dk/course/jjua55235u/2020-2021](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/jjua55235u/2020-2021)). Is it “too new”, or is it a growing pioneer field?
2. Can a PhD help me with regards to shaping future laws and policies? Would I be able to achieve the same in the labor market in terms of influence on legislative work?
3. How many hours a week do you put into it? How is your mental health and social/family life? Do you have a job on the side?
4. Is it difficult to get financial support for a PhD? Here in Denmark it costs around 217.000 DKK to do a PhD.
5. Is it difficult to suddenly have to be a teacher/researcher without having done it prior to a PhD? Did you feel a bit “lost” at the beginning?
6. Is it possible to get into a PhD programme if you have sort of average grades, but a very good project and motivation/“fit”?
7. Would you call a PhD an “outdated, expensive pyramid scheme to please professors’ egos” as one of my friends has called it? (I try to hear all sides before making a decision).
8. Is 25-26 years old seemingly “too old” of an age to start a PhD? I’ve also heard this from some people. I don't think it's true, though.
9. Can you modify the project as you go along? How much can you modify it?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your time and have a great day.

It’s mental health awareness day, and I realised I cannot do this any longer.

j9u9vt,TAdudeman,t2_56bf53a3,Postgrad student here. I feel like reading research papers is impossible and it's affecting my mental health. How do you do it?,"Hello all,

I am a business student with strategy as my major. I find the concepts intriguing and interesting, but reading through the papers feel completely impossible to me. I am linguistically strong compared to my peers, but the reading itself just feels like banging my head against a brick wall, and what I thought was a decent English vocabulary seems to be completely in my own head. I have a midterm exam in approximately a week, and I need to recap 27 papers in that timespan, while simultaneously working on my other classes. I have paid attention in class, and I feel like I have an okay grasp of the concepts, but when I'm trying to read I just get overwhelmed.

I can get through one sentence, and suddenly I catch myself drifting off, and I need to go back. The jargon used in these articles seems unnecessarily complicated and hard to understand, and I drift off because I can't keep my focus due to the articles being written the way they are. I'm not blaming the authors nor the academic circles responsible for the research at all, but rather my own head and its inability to sit out long and complicated pieces of literature.

This has become somewhat of a bad spiral, as it stresses me out to no end that I'm not mastering it, which leads to me putting it off, which leads to stress, which further deprecates my learning. I'm completely lost, and I feel like I might implode soon if I don't crack the code. If anyone of you have some advice for me on how to tackle a) the papers at the best possible way to learn (or memorize if that is all I have time for), and b) manage the stress that comes with it.

I feel like most of my peers can breeze through these now, and it's insanely demotivating, as I've always been a good student and picked up on things quickly. I feel like I'm falling off, and that higher education isn't for me. I honestly thought I had a quicker mind than this.",1,2020-10-12 16:36:58

I'm 24 and I didn't continue any education after graduating in england when I was 16 because of mental health issues pertaining to sexual abuse I suffered as a child. 

I really want to decide... the only catch is... the more I think about it and try to figure it out, the more maddening and confused I get on what is best for me. 

I've looked at so many careers, listed by my interests, pros and cons of the profession, earnings, projected job demand...

I am so stuck I don't even know where to begin! 

The list of careers I've considered so far: 

Veterinarian (My Dad is a vet and I have worked in this field since quitting school- so plenty of experiance) 
Doctor- perticularly an internist, or family medicine
Forensic anything-- except anything IT related. From accounting, to DNA analyst to forensic pathologist and forensic anthropologist 
Radiation Therapist 
Dentist 
Virologist/ epidemiologist 
Clinical labratory scientist


I am INTJ on personality type- 

Me personally I get bored so easy I know I'm going to need a job where everyday is different. I also don't care about the money as much, I want to be comfortable but not rich. I just care about being effective and good at what I do mainly. I want to be useful. I would say my strongest trait is investigative but I can be incredibly artistic and creative. 

I love problem solving and puzzles.

jbpyue,c_hriscole,t2_5jkpxncq,Would dropping my minor ruin my chances of a career?,"So I’m not sure if this qualifies as a “simple” problem and if it will be accepted on this community- but Im freaking out. Im a STEM major (biology) senior undergrad student, and Im not sure how valuable I will look to grad schools if I drop my Environmental Studies minor. However, my other option is possibly tanking my GPA. Sorry for the formal- i’m on mobile... *collective, annoyed groan*

 So, I’m in physics 2 right now, however, some very intense family problems have come up (I’m talking immediate family, terminal illness problems) and suddenly I can barely focus anymore. I wasnt doing amazing in the first place, mind you, but I’ve recently gotten into therapy and i’m *trying* to get my mental health back to a good place. However, i’m on track to get a C in physics. I bombed my first two exams and, admittedly, I did not study enough, but I definitely put myself in a place of major, debilitating stress the week before. My prof told me the only way I could fail the class is if I do even worse on my exams (very unlikely), but the only way I could get to a high B is if I do really, really well (also unlikely). It’s near impossible, actually, because not only would I have to change up my already stressful studying habits, but I would also have to relearn everything for the cumulative final. I want to drop the class and take it again next semester. 

So this is where the issue lies. If I drop the class, due to complete fucking stupidity on my part, I will have to drop my environmental science minor in order to fit physics into my schedule next semester. I am a biology major who no longer plans on med school- I want to go into environmental law or research on aquatic systems/ possibly research in ecology. 

Would I be completely fucked if I dropped my minor? I’m not super worried about the W on my transcript if I dropped physics because, honestly, the circumstances of this shitty year would make it hard for anyone to judge me on that, but I’m not sure if they would be as lenient on me being a regular old average biology major... Or if it would be even worse if my GPA were to be tanked even more by a C in physics. This is the cause of a lot of stress for me, so if anyone could possibly help me I would really appreciate it.",1,2020-10-15 15:42:11
je2m4m,rugoutfromunderme,t2_5l4g4npk,Grad students making our plan Bs - is there space for people like us in academia?,"I'm a 6th year PhD student in a social science department at an institution where it generally takes 8+ years to finish. It's the/one of the top departments in the field. It seems like all of my colleagues are talking about getting out of academia in recent months, no doubt in part due to grim expectations for the job market and possibly also in part based on personal reflection/reprioritization during the pandemic. People who I never, ever expected to leave academia are actively making plans to go. It is sometimes quite sad to me that some of these friends are planning to leave; they are so talented and good at what they do, and their work is important. But they, and I, are considering leaving for two reasons:

1) the job market is insanely competitive and for many people it means 5+ years of prioritizing nothing but work to constantly apply for jobs and move around for various VAPs and post docs before maybe getting a tenure track position, if you are lucky

2) the toxic work culture of academia is unsustainable and not what we want from our lives. I'm talking about the workaholism, publish-or-perish, performative humblebragging about how much one works, the tenure clock, and like i said before - having to be willing to move anywhere in the country/world at the expense of our personal lives and often mental health, sometimes constantly for years.

What I want to know is - - is there space in academia anymore for people who want to work reasonable hours (I mean like 9-6 M-F most of the time)? For people who need to have other things going on that is not work, for people who know they need to rest and do so? I honestly cannot tell at this point. I look at my advisor and the profs in our department and most of them are responding to emails at night and on weekends and just constantly in a frenzy. I imagine that people like me get out-competed by people who just love to work all the time (yes, I know this is unhealthy/unproductive for most people but there are some who just love to work and only work and don't really experience negative results) - - or by super competitive people who are maybe less balanced but are driven to collect everything they can on their CVs. I have done well for myself as a grad student so far, but I value my work flexibility and taking down time when I need it.

Social sciences/humanities colleagues who have been on the job market in recent years - what is your perception? Are there new hires out there who do successfully create work/life balance who are not culled when it comes time to get tenure? Will things be even more cutthroat in a post-covid world? If one needs something like a 9-5ish job to feel like a human being, is it worth trying to stay in academia at all?",1,2020-10-19 14:27:24

I just was awarded an NIH F32 fellowship for the next three years. My annual performance meeting and renewal is coming up next month.

My problem is that I am unhappy and burned out, and I want to let my boss know, but not cause her to cancel my renewal.

I work long hours, usually until 10pm, and until midnight or 2am twice a week. I also have three kids and a wife at home, and working these hours means that I can go a couple days without seeing my kids, and my wife picks up a lot of slack.

My boss is a great scientist, but she is very demanding. My long hours aren't enough for her, and even though I have succeeded in getting several critical experiments to work that three other PhD scientists failed at in our lab, I get the feeling she thinks that I am lazy.

The long hours, stress, and pressure to produce are having an impact on my physical and mental health. Another postdoctoral fellow just announced that he is leaving the lab for a job at a Biotech firm, and he privately told me that the pressure from our boss was the main reason he is leaving.

BUT, I love my research project. I'm a scientist, and I have a drive to explore and discover things. My family is also not in the position to have me loose my job now.

So, the question is: 

How do I tell my boss that I am burned out and unhappy, and that her pressure is a major cause of this?",1,2020-10-25 01:59:46

going and I have family issues - my nerves are shot and anxiety is eating me alive. I struggle with dyslexia and I wasn't receiving any help at all. I pursued it and have now got some support (very general and nothing at all like what I've received in the past) but I guess at least I'm getting something. I received an extension of 4 weeks and a lot of help from my tutor in guiding me towards where I need to be. However, everything just takes way longer than it seems to take anyone else, and one week per chapter even if I'd done all the reading isn't enough. I've been keeping to the plan but absolutely nothing is complete, the refs are all over the place. Paragraphs half completed, not all particularly well - it's just a complete mess.

I'm concerned as to whether it's possible to get yet another extension - does that ever happen? Will I be charged more fees? Am I best just handing it in and praying that it scrapes a pass?

I feel sick at how badly I've failed everyone. I studied so much to get onto this course and cover the gaps in my knowledge and now I'm failing so badly in what was supposed to be the easy part.

My family are frustrated with me, my sister is likely to lose her job soon and she is struggling with her mental health too. She's been suspended from work for 6 months for a bullying allegation - this person has also accused someone else of sexual harassment, their tribunal was on Friday and they said they believed him (that she harassed him), and now that women has to go back to work. My sister says the witnesses couldn't even be questioned and the things she supposed to have done took place on days she wasn't at work, so her employer let him change the days, saying he must have been mistaken.

I also have a disabled sister and she is constantly shouting and angry at everything; because she has to wear a mask, because she has to sit in the back of her personal assistant's car to go out because the news talks about Covid-19. I just want to go to bed and not wake up.",1,2020-10-25 21:09:29
hmcpsd,Chlorophilia,t2_idccd,Year 1 of PhD and feeling utterly burned out and finished,"I'm sorry for the incoming rant! 

I'm coming to the end of the first year of my PhD (UK) and I'm feeling completely finished. On the outside, everything has gone extremely well. Science is what I love and I was never really able to see myself doing anything else. As an undergrad I finished top in my year at a world-leading university, with lots of research experience on the side that led to two first-author papers. I went straight into a PhD programme at the same university, for a project that I designed myself with a wonderful supervisor. My PhD research is officially going well and I'm on target to hit the milestones, all of this whilst working embarassingly few hours.

Despite this, I'm hating it. My research fills me with anxiety to the point where I often feel physically sick and I'm constantly paranoid that I've messed up and will be outed as incompetent or a fraud, or that my work isn't novel or useful. Writing papers was the absolute worst - despite both of my papers going through with only minor revisions, the stress was almost unbearable. I'm regularly praised for my progress and yet I don't feel like I'm productive at all - I rarely do more than 35 hours a week and a lot of that feels unproductive and distracted, which makes me even more convinced that I'm producing nonsense. And yet, despite not actually working very much, my work still feels like it's taking over my life and I probably spend as much time worrying about my work as actually doing it. 

This is made worse by anxiety about the future. I have few connections in my field because what I'm doing is a totally new direction for my research group. I've always been very independent so persuading my supervisor (who I have a long and good working relationship with) to agree to supervise a project that nobody at my university has direct expertise in sounded fine at the time, but I've now realised how isolated I am. I have a co-supervisor who is more experienced in this field but he is halfway across the world and can be challenging to deal with. I've also become disillusioned with my specialism (numerical modelling) and increasingly interested in observational oceanography, but I have even _fewer_ connections with that area. And of course, academia is one of the most absurdly competitive professions in existence.

So I'm now here, feeling like running away after my PhD. I joked for a long time about running away to another country and starting a farm but things have now got so ridiculous that I'm finding myself thinking that this is a great idea. I just don't see how I can cope with an academic career when I've been so privileged and have had such an easy ride and can't even cope with that. I love the ocean and science and could not imagine doing work that isn't related to the marine environment, but the path that I'm on feels unsustainable. In my head I've already borderline given up but I haven't got a Plan B and haven't got a clue what that Plan B could be because I have no connections outside of academia and not doing something related to environmental/marine science isn't something I could fathom. I'm also pretty desperate to work abroad and I'm very aware that postdocs would be a very good way of doing that. 

I do not know what to do and haven't got a well-framed question to ask here. I know that this looks like a mental health carcrash and it sort of is, but I've had professional help for most of my life so there's not much else I can do about that. I don't know whether I should just give up and try to find something else to spend my life on (god knows how/what). Or part of me wonders if this is just burnout from some combination of never having left the school system and seeing my entire value as a human being as being my science. If anybody has felt something similar or has advice on how to get out of this mess, it would be greatly appreciated.",1,2020-07-06 18:04:35
hmg04x,earthiscubic,t2_dl19g,Should I re-apply for PhD in order to strive for academia?,"Hi this is actually my first post on Reddit as I really need your advice. I am from Singapore, a small but relatively rich country outside Europe, and has recently graduated from one of the top two universities in UK, studying chemistry. Becoming a professor of some sort has always been what I envisioned my future to be since high school. I used to (and still do, I think) enjoy knowledge, learning about new things, and figure out how things work. Oxbridge life, however, has been very stressful and I felt that I was learning more for survival than for the sake of it in my time there. My grades have also been mediocre as a result and I have gotten consistently 2.1 for the year-end exams. My poor work ethics may have caused it as well, as I used to get by with procrastination and weird working hours before university but that obviously does not work in Oxbridge. It also does not help that we are mostly assessed only based on one exam per year, since I produce quality work (despite procrastination as I uphold a high standard for my work even though they are not graded) but have a hard time developing a schedule to revise the whole year's worth of content.

With my year 3 grades I applied for PhD programmes in top schools like Stanford, Harvard, UC Berkeley, Caltech and the other top school in UK. One reason I applied to these top schools is that I want to do PhD close to my SO who has been getting consistently firsts, so we applied to the same schools and hope for the maximum amount of overlaps. Unfortunately, I was rejected by all of them without interview. The applications were done hastily while juggling year 4 work and to be honest, I also felt seriously unprepared for PhD as well as the application since I have only had prior short summer research experiences, so I was unclear which field I want to go in and what's the research landscape like. I also did not contact all of the US PIs for my applications and did not have funding for PhD when applying. 

Dejected, I resorted to applying for PhD funding from a local research institution which, in my opinion, conduct somewhat subpar research and there is a bond of 4 years of service which means I stray further away from my goal of entering academia. I have previously applied to the institution for undergraduate funding and made it to the final round of interview but did not get it mainly due to the type of research I wanted to do (I was more idealistic back then and prefer fundamental research to applied research, which for a small country like Singapore is not practical). To my surprise, the institute rejected me as well without an interview (although this time I stated that my interest is in synthetic materials). At the same time, I received my grades for my final year exam which is still 2.1 and fell way below my expectation. Admittedly I did not study extremely hard for this exam but as it is open book it saves me a lot of memory work and I thought I did better than previously. This caused me to seriously doubt myself and my abilities. I have seen from this sub how stressful and competitive academia can be. If I can't even get a first-class and be selected for PhD, how can I survive the brutal competition during and after PhD to get into academia?

Sorry for the long read but I just want to give as much background to my situation as possible. My SO has already accepted his offer for the other school - he has a bond with the local institution aforementioned and cannot afford to delay a year and apply again. Right now I have graduated and am at a loss of what to do, should I still consider academia and research as a viable career option? I am not a materialistic person and will be satisfied as long as I have decent food to eat every day and a cosy place to stay in. I am considering whether I should explore other career options but I cannot stand a routine job with too much repetition. At least in research I will be testing stuff out and doing something new everyday. Plus, I do enjoy thinking and I still love science. I just don't know if I will be qualified enough and can withstand the pressure. Four years of Oxbridge has already pushed me to the boundary of having mental health problems. I also do not want to stray too far away from my SO. I treat our relationship very seriously and we are both striving for marriage once our lives are settled. 

So, graduate students, post-docs, and academic staff, what do you think I should do?

If I want to continue aiming for research and academia, I will need to gather more research experiences, as well as get funding. My year four project only lasted for about two terms (4 months) and nowhere near publishable level, though I did submit a project report and had a viva on it. My previous research experiences consist of 3x2 months each, all somewhat related to synthetic materials but in different labs. My parents have already supported me through four years of expensive overseas student Oxbridge education and it will not be possible for us to self-fund any further education.

I may also send emails to ask what exactly caused all of them to turn me down. My grades? My letters of recommendations? My application essays? Although they are unlikely to get any replies. 

Of course I can also apply to less competitive schools and PhD programmes, but I feel that just make my chances of going into academia even slimmer. That also does not resolve the issue of funding - being a non-exceptional international student just make it near impossible to get funding from the school itself. The COVID situation isn't making it any better. Singapore is a very small country and there aren't many funding opportunities for PhD in chemistry besides the institution mentioned. 

If I don't go for a PhD, then my life will be significantly easier. But it kind of makes me feel that all the efforts that I have put in until today have gone to waste, and I don't know if I can find a profession that I will enjoy as much. Still, it is better than dropping out of grad school halfway or leaving academia as a junior academic staff.",1,2020-07-06 20:38:34
ia8112,16H07,t2_63ct8rqk,Can't get away from the crushing feeling of how toxic academia is :( mainly due to one of my professors?,"**Sorry for the long post, TL;DR at the bottom (but a full read would be massively, massively appreciated).**

I'm starting my first year of grad school in a few weeks, and I expect to complete a PhD within the next 5 or 6 years. I was quite talented at undergrad, did 2 research internships, got 3 publications (one sole author), and was well-liked by my lecturers. However, since my penultimate year of study, I have started to feel as though academia might not be for me, not because I wouldn't rise to the challenge, but because I am simply not prepared to backstab and fight people to get a position.

One of my professors, for example, questions my friendship with my supervisor all of the time. She doesn't get along with him on a personal level, and has berated me the whole time for working with him, despite him being supportive of me, my research, and my mental health and wellbeing. I have come to the realisation that she is not very nice, and just because she's a senior academic, doesn't mean she is right. I mentioned that I may want to leave academia after a PhD, and she called me a 'sellout' and mocked me. She's made me cry (and I never cry) for getting near-perfect grades, but not as high as she would expect because I have to balance my part-time job and I also choose to do ECs so I'm not studying all of the time. But apparently that's not good enough. There are literally hordes of students trying to suck up to her to get onto her flashy research trips and she hand picks her favourites to go. She has verbally offered things to me, but I think she knows I won't accept, and I think this annoys her. She seems to actively encourage division, too. For example, we had a guest speaker fly in last year, and she said she was only going to let certain people come to the dinner. I fought for my friends to attend alongside me (who she picked), and then, for the other spots, rather than picking who replied to the email first, she then just picked the people she liked, further creating divides in the student body. Her little minions then run events and leave out others (even not inviting people to their own graduation celebration), and she's just creating this supremacy that I cannot stand, and no one can see fault with it (except for me and my supervisor).

I would have stayed at my undergrad university, but all of this, coupled with their lack of funding, drove me away. I am going to be studying in a program whose department is ranked number 1 for my field overall, although a bit lower for my actual specialism. I'm going to miss my supervisor terribly but he said he will help me from a distance, and said that I should go where the funding and high rankings are. 

So now I'm about to start grad school, and I'm really depressed. I'm excited to research and take some really interesting classes that I couldn't do during my BA, but I just don't think I can cope with it in the long run. Even chatting to my future classmates on social media makes me realise that maybe, whilst I have the intellect for academia, I don't have the backbone. Does anyone else feel like this? Am I wasting my time doing grad school? I have to reapply for the PhD (starting off on just an MA, so I can get out), but I've wanted to do a PhD since I was young, and I do love my research, but I just can't see myself working in such a toxic environment in the long term.

**TL;DR**: certain academics and fellow students have made me realise that I can't cope with the ruthlessness needed to succeed in academia (or at least, how it seems to be), but I don't want to leave before finishing my PhD. Am I wasting my time? How can I stop feeling like this?",1,2020-08-15 14:13:37

The work is going good. However it is very difficult to work with him. The professor is irregular with the weekly meetings, abruptly cancels meetings, or at times even forgets about the meeting. 

I have lost count of the number of times he has cancelled or postponed meetings. Still I will try to paint a picture. We have decided to meet three times a week. But in the past four months there have been weeks if not days that he continuously cancelled meetings. 

I am loosing my mind now. I have ranted, ranted and ranted this to my friends. This is taking a toll on my mental health for which I am already struggling because of other reasons. I have informed him about my other commitments and priorities. But nothing has changed. 

The only reason I am still sticking with the professor is the hope of getting a publication out from the work, because the work has been honest and sincere from my side. Getting a publication will mean a lot for my PhD applications.

I am a female student about to enter grad school and I have been working with a particular female faculty member for 2 years now, during my last two years of undergrad. I recently brought up the subject of boundaries with her because there were things we were doing that I felt kind of blurred professional/personal boundaries, and it was starting to be confusing for me as she would always insist that our relationship was purely professional, but to me these aren't professional things to do with a student and it seems more like stuff you'd do with a friend. These things included: 

- Asking me to help her come up with baby names for her unborn child. 
- Texting me about her beef with her dad, how annoying her MIL is sometimes, her mental health issues
- Texting me funny memes from twitter 
- Also texting me during meetings and talks to make jokes about the speaker 
- Inviting me to her family's vacation house for the weekend 
- Telling me that I'm ""like family"" (later said she didn't mean it like that and I misinterpreted her words, although I'm not sure how else you could interpret that) 
- Going to see a movie together over the weekend 
- Inviting me over to her home on a weekend to watch a movie while she is in her pajamas 

These don't include everything that has happened over the past 2 years but they are pretty representative. Like I said I was an undergrad when all of this stuff happened (or had just finished undergrad but not yet in grad school) and taking classes with her. 

Anyway when I brought up boundaries she insisted that this is all normal stuff for profs to do with their students especially when you get to grad school, and that if I thought it wasn't professional I was just misunderstanding things. Is this true? I feel like I'm being gaslit. Are these things you'd consider doing with a student, grad or undergrad?",1,2020-08-08 01:00:12

i8pa4e,1stGenAcademic,t2_6lqbmxb4,"How to Go About Resigning from a Project with Advisor who Sexually Harassed Me and Maintain my Image, Co-PI is New Chair of Department","Anthropology, Master's Student, USA

In my senior year of my undergrad, I was involved with original research (guided by my advisor) as well as being a Research Assistant for a project he was doing with an academic from a separate institution. (I am going to be as vague as possible for my protection). I was going through a hard time per events in my personal life which was impacting my academic work, and found myself in a very vulnerable position. Eventually, I had to let my advisor in on some of the details of why I wasn't as attentive, and he offered advice to get out of an abusive situation. However, the day I moved into a women's shelter, he called me into his office hours and asked if I wanted to explore the potential of a relationship, as well as making other unprofessional comments. I awkwardly left the office hours and a week later he apologized admitting he was unprofessional and going through a personal crisis, and that wasn't how he felt. Since I didn't have the mental or emotional capacity to deal with this at this time, I desperately needed school to be normal, and I wanted to not give up work that I found valuable (on a societal level) and holding the potential to help my career, I agreed to try to continue working with him and maintain professionalism. He hasn't been inappropriate since, but I have realized working with my counselor that I am in a toxic work environment still due to this situation and it isn't good for my mental health to work on this project anymore. I became very unreliable in getting tasks done for this project, and every time I tried to engage I found myself in an awkward emotional and cognitive snowball about the contradictions and unfairness of the situation I found myself in and the objective of the work as well as how I felt bad about not being able to give my 100% which the interlocutors deserved. I have had advice to let myself just gradually slip away from him since I'm starting at the new institution, but due to not being an attentive research assistant this summer, I feel that leaves me looking bad/unprofessional to the new Chair of my department, putting me starting out on a bad foot. I think the professional thing to do is to let them both know I no longer want to be involved in this project in the future (asking to not be a part of the professional conference presentations, other prep for the reports, etc. here on out). I still do however have a chapter in peer review process for co-authorship in process so I can't fully cut ties. I am also unsure how to go about work I need to finish with my original research, and how much I need to let him in on what I'm doing, include him in the review process, or discuss co-authorship on anything I produce. How do I go about distancing myself by asking to terminate my involvement in the project (e.g. format letter/email/video call (since in person no longer able)) what are examples of things I should/should not say, and do you have any advice for this first gen student who does not know the ropes of academia and is still very early on in her career on how to navigate this situation.

Thanks in advance for your advice.

This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons.",1,2020-08-12 23:57:45
i8z2jb,randombjkfan1903,t2_3vmb9vc8,Allegations of miscount by ex girlfriend,"My ex is trying to get me kicked out of university

So I am an international student who studies in the UK, my ex was also an international student who was doing a 1 year Erasmus in the same University.

We had a really problematic break up during the coronavirus lockdowns when we were both outside the UK and she blocked me from everywhere. I tried to contact her a few times (I know I shouldn't have) from my secondary instagram account and my cousins phone and she blocked all of them. I tried talking to some people whom I thought were common friends but they were all very rude to me on text. I accept this behavior to be unsolicited contacts.

So in the end, after being blocked by my ex during the coronavirus lockdown(unable to leave my house) and being ignored by all of our common friends, my mental health really declined I texted her mom (whom I never met) on Facebook and I told her that my ex had some of property in her room back in the UK and I told her that we bought plane tickets together and I would appreciate if they could let me know whenever they could get a refund since the flight was canceled dude to the virus outbreak.

I told her the exact amount of money and gave her a full list of the items that are still under the possession of her daughter. The list included: toothbrush, contact lenses, pyjamas, t-shirts, sweatshirts, hairdryer, bondage, lubricant and condoms. Now before anyone here judges me let me state that I am not proud of this behavior.

So after that her mom called me a liar multiple times and used offensive language against me. 

At that point I told her that I was not a liar and I could send pictures of us but was afraid that sending them without her consent could cause problems. 

She accused me of being a liar again.

At that point I made a google search and saw that I could send non explicit pictures.

I told her mom that I could send non explicit pictures.

She accused me of being a liar again.

I have sent her a selfie of us in a bus. Just 2 people taking a selfie.

She used offensive language again and I did not say anything.

The same day, someone I have never met, a friend of my ex sent me a message on Instagram. Texted me 4 paragraphs of swearing and threatening to kill me. 

I told them I only wanted my money and my property back and was left no other options other than to text her mom.

So my ex complained to the university about me and she still goes around bragging about this complaint while the university doesn’t seem to care about me.

In her complaint, my ex gave lots of fake evidence by deleting some of the messages sent by her and her friends to me. I have screenshots of them.

I have defended myself during a hearing. I told the university that I did these things under these circumstances and I am not proud of them. I stated that I did not mean any harm. In the end, my case was referred to the committee of discipline by a disciplinary officer. This only happens in serious cases.

I really don't know what to expect. Do people actually get kicked out of university for such things? What would you advice me to do during the next hearing?",1,2020-08-13 12:32:41
i9bxfh,mathbiostudent,t2_mw62e,xPost from r/gradschool -- When is it worth spending the time and energy cost to revise and get previously unpublished manuscripts across the finish line?,"Got a PM suggesting I also post here as my topic was perhaps a better fit for here than r/GradSchool

**Background**: I had a recent chat with my advisor about my career plans after I graduate from my PhD. The three options I am considering consist of pursuing the private sector ""data science"" route (more pay, but I've already heard of my colleagues who've gone that route talking about long term job instability), pursuing the research scientist route in a US government lab (interesting work, but funding stability issues in early career and big unknowns with the election coming up), or trying to get on the statistician track at a government agency (my preferred route because of the job stability, work/life balance, and topical interest in keeping vital agencies running). 

I would like to continue doing something scientific in some form, but I'm not competitive enough and do not have the CV for R1 academia. My advisor is respectful of the fact that I am interested in alternative career tracks. However, with the present job climate and economic uncertainty, he said I should also keep my doors open to make sure I can maintain an income stream. He said that I shouldn't rule a research university post-doc out, and should utilize his connections to other PIs if necessary. This sounded like a worthwhile thing to keep in mind; years ago, a post-doc did indeed save my dad after he was fired from his industry job, and he was able to buy time with the post-doc before jumping back to a higher-paying position. 

**The Current Situation**: This leads me to my present area of uncertainty. My publication record is fairly weak for post-doc applications (I got involved with a failed startup during my PhD). My advisor said he could still help me land a position, but that to help myself, I needed to bolster my CV. I have one first-author paper that came out in a respected specialist journal and a middle-authorship on a megajournal paper. I'll hopefully be submitting one more first-author before I graduate. 

Prior to beginning my PhD, I did a post-baccalaureate fellowship and worked extensively on a couple of projects over the course of 2 years. My prior advisor during the fellowship wanted me to stay a third year to ensure that I would publish those projects, but I wanted to change fields at that point and also wanted to go to grad school as soon as possible because I was a little bit older of a student. I had manuscript drafts written up for both projects that my advisor said he would take over at that point and submit, but of course, the manuscripts got filed away after I left, and a few months thereafter, he had moved on to other projects. 

My current advisor mentioned that it would be very helpful for my academic CV to get out papers for at least one of the two abandoned projects and said that just in case I needed a post-doc, getting out one more paper could be a saving grace, even if the paper were from a different field. The mathematical methods I use do unify my research experience across the fields I've been involved in (I'm in environmental chemistry now, but was formerly in neuroscience). My advisor said that the time involved in getting one of the previous papers published would be worth it. Not surprisingly, my prior advisor agrees because he obviously wants to get that work out.  

At a gut level though, I feel that this is a pretty bad idea, which is why I wanted to get some feedback from the community here. For the past few years, I've thought of the abandoned projects as sunk costs now. Because of the updated work that's been published since then in that subfield, I would definitely have to a re-coding and re-running of simulations. Figures would have to be re-done. There would be a lot of additional literature reading in a domain I'm no longer familiar with and the discussion section of the manuscript would have to be pretty thoroughly re-done. The techniques are similar, but it's still a different field, and I'm thinking I could be better off making my existing projects in my present field better. I regret not putting in a little more extra effort at the time to put the work at least on Arxiv, but my hands were also pretty full with ramping up in a graduate program as a new student. The work as is is not Arxiv-able. 

**The Question(s)**: For the sake of covering all my bases then, is it worth putting in the time and work to get one of those papers across the finish line? As a secondary question, for folks in the sciences, what have your experiences been with abandoned projects? I'd be curious to get more anecdotes to help me make my decision.

My current advisor has my best interests in heart, so I appreciate his input. I just feel like my time could be better spent elsewhere, and even if things have been getting a lot more competitive, I have seen people occasionally still getting post-docs with one or even zero formally published first-author papers (though with multiple submitted). Additionally, for the private sector or government statistician tracks, I feel that taking a research university post-doc could be an opportunity cost and that I may be better served borrowing money from family to continue job applications and self-study if I end up unemployed. A post-doc would help me be in a better position to land government research jobs. 

Clarifying on questions a commenter had in the thread in r/gradschool, I would be getting paid to work on the abandoned projects, but I'm thinking the additional time and energy involved in working on those on top of my existing research commitments and thesis writing may not be worthwhile in light of costs to mental health and interpersonal relationships. However, if I end up unemployed for an extended amount of time after graduating, that would also not be good for career development and life satisfaction. The older projects may not only help with post-doc applications, but for private sector gigs because more industry buzzwords were involved. 

Thanks for reading the long post, and much appreciation for your time and attention.",1,2020-08-14 00:36:17
fo8ofo,NaturalRattle,t2_3sm5s6eg,Ordinarily problematic professor being extra problematic during the pandemic (railing on us for what I would think is an understandable decline in performance) - is it worth directly addressing?,"I'm currently in graduate school. Like most, our program has gone completely online as of about 2 weeks ago.

My field, which all my classmates also work in, has gone from being stable to nearly nonexistent virtually overnight. I took a voluntary unpaid indefinite leave to protect my family (I have an immunocompromised dad and grandfather), some companies have closed indefinitely, and the rest are putting their employees/society in relative danger by encouraging them to just work in homes with clients exclusively (shifting from schools and clinics, where we're usually situated). In short, there is no ideal scenario for any of us at the present time and we are all suffering.

In truth, I've always found this particular professor's behavior needlessly petty and problematic. She often makes snide and cutting remarks in her feedback that aren't constructive - seemed more geared to offend than truly direct/guide. She's a notoriously tough grader. Even her clear favorites complain about how overly ""nitpicky"" and ""anal"" she is. I never vibe with professors who have this authoritarian/hardass teaching style, and from a behavioral psychology standpoint (which I've studied at length), it's ultimately counterproductive, but I can understand it in ordinary times. Not everyone is warm and fuzzy. It is what it is.

I have two other professors who have been really supportive during this undeniably shitty time. One sent our class an email with a link unemployment resources in our state, well aware virtually all of us have lost our jobs (or had our hours slashed at minimum), and a counseling hotline number if our mental health was suffering. Another began our first (virtual) class by asking how the virus has been affecting us emotionally and in general - he called it a ""vent"" session, said he was here for us, gave us excellent and comforting advice, let my classmates cry for as long as they needed. Very standup of him and appreciated.

This other professor, though? Logged into my email today to find an extremely curt email - she skipped even greeting us - and told us that our work this past week has been extremely sub-par/poor quality and that she will fail us the next time we submit something similar. Zero acknowledgment of the current crisis. Just that tactless, obnoxious email.

Though I am usually a master internalizer, I'm not made of stone. This REALLY pissed me off. Do I agree our work this week was sub-par? I can't speak for my classmates, but I know my own work quality has suffered some. **To be clear, I don't want a better grade for admittedly shittier work. I just think she could've made the exact same point with much more tact and empathy,** and even minimal acknowledgment of the obvious: her students are suffering. People tend not to do amazing work when they're suffering - or, in this case, worrying how long they're gonna be able to afford to eat.

Now is a time when kindness and understanding means everything. That kindness could be the difference between someone keeping on and doing something to hurt themselves. I really don't think it's melodramatic to say that. I'm personally really going out of my way to check on people because that's a real concern I have - that my friends or family who already weren't doing so well mentally might choose this pandemic as the time to just end it all. I mean, hell, I've been sober for 5 years - I've generally never wanted to relapse more in my life (luckily I have a lot of other sober friends and we've been really leaning on each other to keep clean - grateful for that). Point being, people are at their breaking points. Students are not robots and they're allowed to slip a little and just be human. I found this email very unprofessional and am considering directly addressing it with her, and possibly her superior (probably further down the line, when this class is over).

fopyhb,Anyun,t2_6s242,Gearing up for PhD application... not sure how to find professors,"I want to apply to PhD programs in Community Health/Population Health/Sociomedical Science/etc. My general interests are (1) health belief/behavior modeling with specific attention on the use of fear and social networks and (2) the use/efficacy of mass media and language, especially on the internet (ie memes) in health messaging. My issue has become that I can't seem to find professors that I align with at any public health uni. I did find and contact a professor at Michigan State's Communications Department that works using a health behavior modeling incorporating fear, so I will be applying there - I'm not worried that it's not a public health school, it's a great program but I also think it's super competitive and I might not be the right fit so I need more options. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't seem to find any other public health professors that I align with. I'm trying to find at least 3-5 professors I might be able to work with so I have 3-5 schools to apply to. I've read lots of papers (between 2-5 a week since I started my masters in 2017), chatted up a handful of professors, and searched through uni websites, but have not found work that directly relates to my interest, just a lot of stuff that supports my thoughts and positions but requires the mental leap I make from my work experience to connect to my propositions. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do in this situation? Public Health PhD applications open in August and priority deadlines are at the beginning of December, so I'm starting to feel the pressure. I found some DrPH programs that I'm a good fit for, but I'm too interested in teaching and academia to not consider a PhD. The positive point of DrPH programs is that you don't need to find a perfect match with a prof to get in, just a few profs that are doing work related to your interests - but PhD programs seem different in that you need to find someone basically doing the same research you want to be doing in order to get in (or am I wrong about that).",1,2020-03-25 13:06:59

But I *still* don't have anything to show them, despite the extra time. I'm not doing well in my head - I'm seeing my psychologist again, but that's recent, and I'm flailing and things are shit.

What should I tell them about this? I've also only been working with them for like a month, and 3 of those weeks I've been in iso.

fsxmpz,joyfulali,t2_7mqdd,Leave of absence before comps?,"Hello all - 

I'm finishing up the second year of my PhD program. I am wrapping up my last course this month. Ostensibly, I should be registering for the comprehensive exam during the summer term with the expectation that it be completed (read, written, and defended) by August 31. Certainly, the program will be accommodating extensions to this date given the disruption of the world right now, but I am wondering what my best approach is given my own situation.

I have two school-aged children who are now home and being online-taught. While I'm grateful that their schools are providing online materials and instruction, it is still a lot of parental supervision. My spouse is an emergency physician working on the front lines of the battle and thus is not able to help much with the kids' needs. Of course, being this close to the health crisis is also bringing a lot of stress and worry to our family and I am feeling and seeing the mental health effects.

My supervisors have suggested that it might be wise to request a leave of absence for the summer term and to hope to resume in the fall, but are open to a later return if necessary depending on the state of things. The LOA would ""stop the clock"" on my PhD progression, and would preserve my funding when I eventually resume.  The alternative is to keep chugging along at it and hope that I can eventually dedicate the time, brainspace and energy to complete the comprehensive exam, but in the meantime continue to pay tuition (covered by scholarship). I would continue to receive my funding during that time but it's for a finite number of months so I would risk running out of funding time eventually.

Seems like a no-brainer to request the leave.  Will this be something I will forever have to justify and explain away? Will this make me seem like a weaker candidate later for grants or academic appointments? Should I just try to get through this without a leave so as to have an ""intact"" PhD period?

ftdf7z,Help_Me_Work,t2_57j6e6vb,I need some real help with my career progression. Just finished my doctoral degree with no first author papers to my name and can't land a job as even a research technician.,"I have just finished grad school with no first author papers to my name and I am struggling to get a job. I had mental health issues before starting my degree but was keeping them in check. Failure after failure and an unsupportive supervisor wound me up to breaking point. After finishing my experiments I had a breakdown and just left the laboratory completely, lapsing in good standing (Australia). I assumed I just wasn't going to finish and would let the final submission deadline pass me by. I got another job in a completely different field and every so often, would read through my thesis draft, get too anxious to function, and not look at it again for a few weeks. Rinse and repeat for like a year and a half. With 6 months to the final deadline, I somehow pulled myself together and finished the thing. I submitted last year and my thesis was finally accepted early this year.

Now I'm looking for jobs and am woefully underqualified. I have no chance at a postdoc since I have no first author papers and my research utilized quite niche and expensive technology, so nobody is working with it. I also haven't set foot in a lab for 2.5 years. I'm trying to sell myself on basic molecular and cellular biology experience but that's not good enough for a postdoc, so I'm applying for research assistant and technician positions. I really want to work as a research assistant because it'll be a good starting point to get back to lab work. With that said, it brings tears to my eyes applying for jobs that I was totally qualified for 7 years ago, when I first finished undergrad. And even then...I'm not getting the jobs. I've had two interviews that were really quite crushing - one in particular was a technician position where I felt like I was being interviewed for a postdoc - and now am quite sure I can't even get into my 'sure thing' line of work. And now Covid-19 has made everything worse, and there are literally no jobs in my field to apply for because everything is closed.

I just feel undone. I was a functional, confident 22 year old before starting my PhD. Now I'm a depressed and anxious 29 year old with absolutely no faith in myself or my work. I just want a job. I just want to be able to progress my career. Instead I'm sitting in my parents house, having lost what little work I did have due to Covid-19. How on earth am I supposed to come back from this? I have never felt more disheartened in my life. Because I finally did it. I got my shit together and defeated my white whale. And for what? For crippling mental health issues and 0 job prospects.

I am asking in earnest - what am I supposed to do from here? One of my PhD supervisors hasn't spoken to me in almost 3 years and the prospect of seeing him makes me want to die. The other one is nice but won't help me network for any positions, and I secretly believe he doesn't think I can do it so doesn't want to stick his neck out.

Recently I've gone through some serious family problems, but have continued to work sincerely through them. However when the COVID-19 lockdown was enforced, I struggled to find a safe place to stay, and ensure groceries were available. There were also issues  associated with other basic amenities. 

Also, I've been through some severe personal trauma over the years which began to resurface during the isolation and my mental health has taken a hit. I informed my current advisor of the situationand explained why my productivity has been very low, and how I'm working on building it back up. 

He did not take kindly to it, and gave me 3 days to come up with excellent progress to make up for 2 weeks lost. However, this was just not possible for me in my current state and I struggled to come up with great progress. He called me up, yelled at me for 20 minutes straight and told me he knew that my PhD admit had made my attitude lax. He threatened that if I didn't work extra hard for however long the quarantine continued, he would mess with my admit. He also wants biweekly updates on my progress. 

I'm really worried because this is something I've worked all my life for, through all trying circumstances, and he was one of my recommenders. This has taken a toll on my already affected mental health, and I'm finding it even harder to concentrate.

1) Current State: I have started a PhD in the university I had my Master's. I am in the beginning of my second year. I am fully-funded for the 4 years. I have one second-author paper in one of our most prestigious conferences (machine learning, NIPS). 

 When I started my PhD, I was working on the sub-field X of Machine Learning, and I formulated a new and important problem and proposed a solution framework in my second paper (submitted). I am passionate about X and want to do research in X for the rest of my life. 

2) Problem: It became clear that my professor sees X as merely a tool. She has a problem in mind which I don't think requires X at all. She pushed me into this project with 2 others (both postdocs). This was a project that has been going on with others, with 0 progress. I don't believe any aspect of this problem. She is pushing the problem very hard on me, and is very attached to it.  


3) Question:   I have discovered there is a PhD thesis offer, and the topic is exactly the problem I have formulated and want to work with, in X. I got goosebumps because parts of the offer description are literally word-by-word parts of my under-review paper. This position comes with salary as well. Should I apply? If yes, how should I break this to my supervisor? One angle to go is: my partner is really suffering in this country as she cannot find a job. It is really taking a toll on her mental health.

Hey all, I’m seeking advice on an issue that has been troubling me for awhile as I’m sure someone out there has experienced this before. Sorry if some of this is vague as I need to keep this anonymous, or in wrong subreddit (maybe r/legaladvice is where I need to go..). 

I finished coursework for a doctoral degree in 2014 at a well-known university. The department has a history of being disorganized and anti-social. A few faculty members have just got up and left the department without warning and international students seem to use the program as a perpetual visa-extender as no one is keeping track of who is in the program. 

My first advisor told me to wait a year for data to be anonymized by staff and later on I found out he lost the data but didn’t tell me about it. I pitched other ideas that didn’t make sense to him but professors at other schools thought they were worth exploring. I took a job since my dissertation was not going anywhere and a couple years went by. For a number of reasons I then switched advisors and quit my job with the intention of devoting all of my time to the dissertation for a year.

The new advisor and I set a goal of graduating in May 2020 and by summer ‘19 he said I was on track, but he wasn’t responsive to e-mails or meetings. Fall ’19 approaches and I am trying to submit the proposal asap but I notice he doesn’t open any of the data files, code, or other materials I submit to him and is unprepared for all of our meetings. I send a very light rough draft to get the go ahead to continue working and I don’t hear back for over two months. I turn around the little feedback I got, resubmit a more substantial draft a few weeks later. More than two months have elapsed and I still have not gotten feedback on the draft. This clearly is not sustainable and has negatively affected my mental health more than I’d like to admit. 

I spoke with the provost office about it and they suggested I find another advisor—I talked with one who said he would be happy to help but later punted back to original advisor.  Admin suggested a professor outside of the department but our research doesn’t line up in any way.  So, I’m stuck, again, and feeling like I should drop out and get on with my life- however, I know I will regret not finishing the degree after all these years.

I haven’t heard back from the provosts office and am now looking at legal options. I have been paying dissertation advisement fees for four years with effectively zero dissertation advisement and feel like I’m a part of some white-collar racket.  I know other students in the program are not happy.

Does anyone know how these things go? …is legal action against the school worth it? I’ve read most settle out of court with NDAs, so I can’t find similarities between cases to judge the probability of success here. I really don’t want to get a lawyer, but I don’t see any other option. Help! 

Any advice is appreciated.",1,2020-04-09 22:07:59

g23svz,Thisisashhley,t2_2ofia6jf,"Got into one unfunded program, low gpa, would staying in undergrad to do a minor and then reapplying for grad school in a year be a good idea?","Hopefully this makes sense to ask here :)
 I will be speaking with my advisor but the earliest appointment available is in a week so any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated!

I am a Liberal Studies major looking to continue on in academia and study English. I applied to masters programs for this Fall. I only got into one program, and it wasn’t one of my top choices. I still like the program but it has no funding and it is cheaper to do online (because I’m out of state), so I am slightly disappointed to be honest.


My gpa was a lot lower than I would have liked (3.0/4.0) I’m curious if it could be beneficial to stay in undergrad for another year to try and get a research position (I haven’t done any research) and or do a minor to boost my gpa. I could do a minor in English and I’m thinking this would look good on my transcripts as well since I’m trying to get into English programs. It would also possibly allow me to network/get better LORs. I am assuming this could help me get into other programs next round. 

I just don’t know if that’s a waste of time or if this is a good strategy. Is this worth the time and money? My gpa is low due to ADHD and mental health which I am working on. I’m determined to not let it stop me. I feel that could do very well in courses for the minor. 

I want to do a PhD (and hopefully at a top program-UCLA, UC Irvine, etc.) and have heard that where you do your MA can affect where you get in for a PhD; the program I got into is at a small state university and it is online. I just don’t want to do a program and then realize I’m going to have a hard time getting into a more competitive PhD.

g2h8rr,wvsidnekeslthroway,t2_5q9xqdzf,Alternate work for someone in religious studies/theology?,"Hello all.

I tried to be sensible. I really did. I thought, “I’ll get a masters in psychology, and open a private practice. I will make good money. I will be happy.” And I’m not saying I wouldn’t, 

but I constantly catch myself doing coursework and thinking about how I wish I could be reading about XYZ religious topic right now. I realized that I have no such drive to read about psychology. On the other hand, I’ve spent (not exaggerating) about 5 days out of the week reading about various religious topics for hours each day, since I was maybe 15? I’m nearly 23 now and it hasn’t slowed down. And it’s honestly often quite stupid stuff to spend my time on, like small details of practices that matter to no one (or certainly no one that I know). I don’t talk to anyone about it because they look at me like I have two heads when I do. It’s pretty alienating. I don’t have any logical reason why I do this, there is no incentive to spending my time on this. I just really care about the subject. Can’t get enough of it. 

(I’m a late student BTW, I’m only just finishing my freshman year. So thankfully I’m not in too deep.) 

So when I was having that thought, it really hit me: I’m setting myself up for a very mediocre work life. And I thought of what I could do in psychology if I had the same lust for knowledge that I have for religious ideas. I don’t know if it’s right for me to go into a field that I like, but care significantly less for, when I have this burning passion right here, waiting to be used. Especially since my job plan involves people’s mental health (I would do my absolute best of course- not trying to imply that I would be negligent or crappy). 

But, of course, the only subject I’m crazy interested in has a horrible job market. So as much as I think I’d enjoy being a professor, I’d like to know what my other options are. 

What else can I do with a religious studies/theology education? I’m not Christian or a man, so I don’t plan on leading a church, unfortunately.",1,2020-04-16 15:38:56

iay0qr,LankyTower,t2_33g5203t,"Is it realistic for me to get onto a PhD in social anthropology with an ok undergrad, and is so how could I improve my chances in the time I have left? (UK)","Hey guys, basically I've been thinking about my future and I just kind of wanted to sound some stuff out because I don't really have anyone to ask at the moment. 

Quick context: Got to a good uni, load of bad stuff happened growing up, got through first year then had a breakdown, resat 2nd and then took an external year as was still suicidal/depressed, got through that now with a 2:1 and wondering what to do next.

So now I find myself looking forward to the year ahead with everything looking like it's going to be alright. I'm really excited because I love my subject, I enjoy doing academic work and having a year of service jobs and then covid unemployment has just reminded me how much I want to get back to it again. I've beaten off my mental health stuff, I've been taken off my medication and feel the most complete I have ever done in my entire life. I do feel bad saying that because there's so much terrible stuff going on in the world right now that you can't help but put your own stuff in perspective sometimes.

 Anyway before I go too off track, long and short of it is that I really really want to do a PhD in the future. I know loads of people say how difficult it is and how it makes peoples mental health worse and so on but its always been my dream. I love anthropology so much and I would love to do research and go on to teach and I'm willing to do anything to get there. I do feel though that I'm just feel  I'm already so behind other people my age.

I went to uni a year late (for a separate medical reason) and obviously taking 3 years to take complete my 2nd year has kind of compounded the problem of being behind everyone else and not really being that successful. When I talk to the few people I know who are going on to do postgrad and beyond all of them are so well put together. They've got LinkedIn's with pages of experience, they've been ahead of the game and organized conferences whilst they were still undergrads and just generally seem to be really on top of stuff. I just can't help but feel that I've got a hell of a lot of ground to make up if in a few years time I am trying to sell myself to a good institution and all I've got is an undergrad.

I really want to get more into organising stuff next year, I have some research areas that I'm really interested in and I don't know how COVID is going to affect stuff in the long run but do you guys have any suggestions on stuff to kind of flesh out my academic profile whilst you're still in your undergrad. Also I just to clarify I really don't mean this in the sense that I just want to have a full looking CV. I would genuinely like to know some ways of getting more involved in research and making myself a good academic for the future, even if it does transpire that I can't do a PhD after all I would still like to do something that uses these skills in the future.

Anyways thanks in advance!

hqbdiv,matryoshkamama,t2_3mzpjbva,Dropping out of grad school. How do I let my department know? What happens to the papers I wrote?,"Hey everyone. So after a rough year and half a semester of summer class, I’ve decided to drop out of grad school. Watching the world unfold during this pandemic has reset my expectations and life goals, and right now I really need to prioritize my mental health over my degree. 

I’m not really sure how to go about letting my department know about my decision. They’ve known I’ve been considering leaving for the past couple of months and of course all of our communication has been through zoom meetings or over the phone. I’m not sure if I need to write a formal letter to my department head or do that and CC my advisor, or if I should ask to meet with them online. 

But what’s getting to me more is, what happens to the work I completed in my one year in grad school? Like I said, I had a rough time this past year and it resulted in two incompletes for two papers I haven’t yet completed. I’m worried that I shouldn’t leave without finishing at least one of those incompletes because I’m worried I’m abandoning my ideas, I guess. One of the papers I really care about and would love to finish at some point. I guess my worry is that after I leave someone is going to use my idea for their own work. Am I being a little juvenile by having this concern? Is there anything I can do to assure my work remains mine?

I was having back pain at the time, but that has developed into a full on herniated L5-S1. The first episode of pain completely laid me out for this entire summer, and I was unable to participate in any fieldwork related to my project. I am lucky that I have a project partner (separate theses) who was able to collect the data we need for our future work. 

I was recovering well until this past week when my partner and I moved into a new place. Now, a week before classes, I am once again bedridden. This is to the point where my partner has to help me shower. I cannot sit or stand. I've emailed my project partners to let them know that I need a few days to focus on my physical (and frankly mental) health while I try to recover again. We know the course to take this time and I have the necessary medical procedures scheduled. 

What I'm honestly scared of, and why I'm reaching out here, is not being able to contribute meaningfully to my project and thus not getting anything out of staying in grad school at this point. The academic responsibilities are incredibly stressful on top of trying to heal. I can't participate in any sort of in-person activity related to my project right now. This has me considering if dropping out is the fairest thing for myself and the project, so that they have time to replace me (like with a one year non-thesis msc).

If it comes to that, what will this look like to PIs in future years if/when I apply to graduate programs again? I have always been studious and a good researcher, and dropping out would be purely due to medical reasons. I love research and I'm terrified that having to drop out now will nix any future chances I have of getting into another program. But I just don't know if I can keep doing this.

I never got much of a break after semester 1 (which i was much looking forwards to after a difficult first semester ) and when semester 2 started a few weeks ago I just felt drained and exhausted and not ready to be back at all

I also had some issues following my wisdom teeth removal at the start of semester 2. I have missed a few classes because I just dont feel ready to be back and be all social. I heard a girl in my class saying how she went shopping to IKea with her mother..sigh.

iokeni,valonmtg,t2_hb6xq,[Junior] How to Deal with a Course with an Unreasonable Workload?," I  am an undergraduate in my junior year at a lower-endish state school. This semester I am taking a 4 credit class for my major and the workload  is far greater than any other 4 credit class I have taken in the  department. The professor regularly says that we should always feel like  we are ""drowning"" in work. He also says that even though the course  is 4 credits we are expected to do 6 credits worth of work.

The  class is destroying my mental health. For this class alone I am having  to spend 20+ hours per week on this one class. It causes me to get  behind in my other classes and I am in a constant loop of catching up after every assignment in this class. I  attempted to talk to the professor about getting the due dates for  homework moved to be more reasonable but he got frustrated and simply  said ""the due dates aren't changing and that is the end of the  discussion"".

Typically  in this situation I would do my best to get ahead in my other classes so that I can spend more time on this, but due to Covid-19 my other classes are having the curriculum developed weekly, so there is no way  to get ahead as the next week's curriculum does not exist.

From  my perspective I signed up in good faith for a 4 credit class and as I  have taken 4 credit courses in this department during the spring and  summer semesters (which are accelerated), I felt that I had a reasonable idea of the workload. It  is as if this class assumes you have no other classes or  responsibilities as it is essentially a part time job in terms of hours  of study and work per week. This is also problematic because my college  is mostly non-traditional students (mid-20s average age), and during a  pandemic I feel that the excessive workload is even less reasonable. I  don't expect the class to be free or easy, I just expect it to be  reasonably doable by the department's own guidelines of taking at most 2  courses in the department simultaneously (in addition to other non-department courses) in one semester and estimating  about 3 hours per week of study per credit hour the course is. At those  recommendations this class is likely not possible for most students.

Should  I just withdraw? I really do not want to but I am not sure what else I  can do. Because I am taking 15 credit hours, needing 20 hours per week  for this one class is not sustainable and it is seriously impacting me. Also the professor is not willing to compromise so I don't really  understand what I can do in this situation to make things manageable.",1,2020-09-08 01:23:32

Due to coronavirus and a bunch of other circumstances, including mental health issues, I’m on an indefinite leave of absence. I’m missing my classes and my studies enormously at the moment but I don’t know when I’ll be able to return. I’m in a very remote environment with barely any friends or people I know so I have more than enough time on my hands. 

I love research (I’m in the humanities) and especially enjoy reading contemporary scholarship. As in, I will do it for fun. However, I’m not the most focused or diligent reader. I’d like to try and change that because I really do genuinely enjoy it when I actually put my mind to it. The problem is party structure. I want some kind of overarching pattern or structure that I build on. I have a great desire to understand the underpinnings and the backgrounds of things. But that can quickly become very expansive and unfocused. 

I’ve been reading random articles and here and there when I feel like it which is good but I’d love to feel like I really delved into something. I feel like I need a long term goal, like an independent study but just with myself. 

I guess what I’m asking is how do you guys manage to progress forward (with research/career goals) when you don’t any goal you are working toward? Is an article a day a good idea? is it pointless to read lots outside of my discipline? Should I just read all the classics? Are there an really good (quality) podcasts or online courses?

ga5h0d,atheoryofjustice,t2_4aualvqw,Question On Writing Letter for a Professor Applying for Tenure,"Greetings, posters of r/AskAcademia. A Professor I deeply respect has asked me to write a letter recounting my experience as a student in a few of their classes so that they can add it to their tenure application.

This Professor has played an instrumental role in my academic success this year, allowed me to focus on mental health as opposed to academic work whenever I requested such accommodation, and has taught me a great deal on various topics both within and beyond my field of study.

As so, I am hoping to write them the most supportive letter possible so I can, even if only incrementally, help them achieve tenure. So, I wonder:

* Are there any critical things that should be included/what qualities hiring committees are especially interested in? (I would not lie, of course, if I thought they did not possess one of these qualities, but if they did, I would surely make this a point of emphasis)
* Are there any things that would seem positive to me, but perhaps not so positive to a hiring committee? E.g., he believed me to be a good student of his and, as of result, was very accomodating; however, I don't want to make it come across as though he is extremely lenient, for example. 
* Initially, I had planned to write anywhere between 3-5 pages single spaced, but I fear now this might be overkill?
* Should I focus on factors such as my enjoyment of the syllabus, class structure, etc. or would I be better served speaking to their ability as a lecturer/coordinator of class discussions and also someone that can be turned to in times of need? Or perhaps some conjunction of both? More specifically, do they want to know if this Professor is great instructor or great person? 
* Finally, his courses really stood out to me because I found them far more intellectually demanding than most, causing me to put a genuine effort in that I sometimes failed to do in other courses. Hopefully mentioning this will not make him appear as though they are overly difficult?

I am currently a master's student, and my mentor for my current research has just extended an opportunity to work with him on another research project he is doing that will begin next year when my current project is over. I am super super stoked on the role, and I am really honored he thought of me. 

That being said, the project involves going to another country for an extended period of time (most likely 12ish months). I have bipolar II and have just recently started medication for it, as I was previously unmedicated. I haven't started discussing specific logistics about the project with him in terms of living arrangements and such, but I will definitely need to consider how I will continue my treatment for bipolar. I have searched the internet for information about mental/general health care where I will be going, but I didn't find anything helpful that even slightly addressed my concerns. 

Basically, when him and I do start discussing logistics of living abroad, I feel that I should ask him about medical care, and I feel like I should do so with the added info of ""I am asking because I have bipolar disorder"" so that he doesn't think I am just asking a general question rather I am asking with a specific reason, and he can hopefully give me better resources or find resources for me or send me in the right direction (he does work in this other country a lot). 

Do you think this is appropriate? I feel like he is the only good source I have to ask, so I worry if I say ""I am asking for a medical condition"" without further details he won't really be able to give me the answers I am looking for. But I also worry about crossing a professional boundary, and don't want him to be concerned that bringing me abroad would be a liability in some way. I feel like we have a good relationship, and I dont think he would be judgmental, I just don't really know the best way to approach the conversation.

I feel like he is asking a lot from me since I am constantly getting emails in the middle of the night asking for me to do stuff on short deadlines. Often times, his email chains to me are just him replying to himself with notes and pdfs attached to it. And it takes me hours to just sift through the emails and categorize everything because it's so incoherent. 

At this point, I feel sick looking at excel documents and I think it's taking a hit on my mental health. Whenever I hear an email, I feel dread. As well, I have basically no time left to study and spend for myself. I'm currently being paid based on an award for my normal project.  but the pay is less than minimum wage given the hours I have to put in for the other tasks I'm charged with.  

Is this normal for research assistants? Is there anything I can do/say to improve my situation?",1,2020-05-08 19:49:17
ggid15,EntireFeature,t2_ubnjkzr,"How do I begin and am I out of my depth? (UK, STEM application in Pharm/Biochem)","So I'm a UK based Pharmacist with a 2.1 MPharm. It was an integrated life sciences masters with strong strands of teaching in Chemistry, Biochem and Clinical studies. It's been a couple of years since I graduated and I have since continued to advance vocationally by moving into more difficult, clinical fields and continuing my learning and professional development. 

The way I've been going about my search for a PhD, is by viewing advertisements for fully-funded studentships at various UK Universities in my related field; Pharmacy, Pharmaceutics, Biochem, Toxicology etc. But I'm a little stuck at: what to do next, how to go about it and whether I stand a chance as a candidate considering my academic history.

Unfortunately during my undergrad I suffered from (verifiable) mental health issues which led to various resits. I was lucky in that I brought it around during my Masters year to attain a 2.1. Due to this my transcript would look pretty terrible without a decent explanation. I was able to attain a 1st in my dissertation in my Masters level research of Computational Chemistry which may stand in my favour.

I am also applying to PhDs that; while similar to my academic skillset, may be tailored towards those with a more stereotypical 'scientific' focused undergraduate degree.  I was hoping someone may have advice with regards to the following:

1. Will my poor transcript and my undergraduate degree being a tad more life science-ish affect my chances of getting onto a PhD in, for example, Pharmacology?
2. How do I apply to studentships? Is it normal to strike up friendly conversation with the supervisors listed in the advertisement first? And then what? Send my CV and a covering letter?
3. Obviously it is important to assimilate more knowledge on the proposed area of research. To what extent do I need to pursue this at this stage? Should I be prepared to have a detailed understanding of the topics prior to enquiry?

Any help would be much appreciated.",1,2020-05-09 16:23:10
gi6cfq,Poppy_pie,t2_475wkv1i,What methodology would be used for this Honours Thesis Question about ethics of pragmatic policy?,"Sorry if this is not the right place to ask - if it isn't any suggestions on where to go please let me know. I did read the rules but couldn't join homework help and college seemed more like undergrad than research and unsure if it fits here or there :) 

Firstly: I do not want to provoke a political argument. I want to know how to research the problem. I know people will have strong opinions but I want to know how to unpack it. I am unsure on the correct answer or even if there is a 'definitive answer' which is why I thought it was a good research problem.   


\- Honours thesis / Social Science / Policy analysis(?) / methodology confusion

This is about research methodology not about answering the question (I will attempt that in the thesis)

Honours study is isolating, COVID HONOURS is even more so.  

**QUESTION:** 

&gt;**""Is pragmatic policy making ethical policy making"" ?**

  
Background:

I'm still trying to get a working question for my thesis and thats what I have so far.   


(Content advice: sensitive material below).

My question on pragmatic policy being ethical will be examined through using a case study of a policy proposal that wants to implement secure theraputic facilities for at-risk young people; The proposal I am using as a case study argues to divert specific groups of at-risk young people who otherwise would end up in prison or a form of secure welfare we have in my state (short term stays in locked ""homes"") a lot of kids go through these locked up homes like 'revolving doors' and really get the help they need into a more lasting theraputic home that could help them (prison produces more harm also).  

 (E.g Twelve year old girl, being fed drugs, with predatory men and not engaging in treatment, and say 'offending' as well - going in and out of these programs but not getting adequate help).

The rationale for this proposal is that it will reduce the harms that are happening to these kids now through offering better alternatives to the options they currently have (but the **problem** is that it still does not address the broader structural issues that create and entrench these issues). Aka its pragmatic policy.

So thus my question is: Is pragmatic policy such as the one above *ethical* policy making?  Using that policy proposal as a case study - using policy analysis?  


Are we plugging holes in a bad ship and not addressing the bad ship is unethical because it will doom so many in the future (I suck at metaphors).

**My question to the academics here:**  


What good methodology to explore this would be? I feel like 'policy analysis' suits but I don't know if thats right. I was originally doing discourse, content or narrative analysis (with some background theory of Capital via Bourdieu - there is a lot of background research showing social capital to be a major determining factor behind outcomes) but my question was slightly different and now it doesn't make sense to use that. Well I can still use Bourdieu for relevant things. But yeah any thoughts on methods?  I have all the readings. I just feel overwhelmed.

What methodology would I use? How could I unpack this?

\- It will be narrowed down to my country/my specific state where possible/specific demographics/within my field (Social science/social work/social policy). 

&amp;#x200B;

Further background if needed:

To reiterate the problem: There is an issue that by continuing to make concessions and implementing 'pragmatic policy' because we cannot wait for society to address broader structural issues that produce disadvantage and adversity (more money for housing, welfare, healthcare - not just money but effective reformation as well as cultural changes in how many mental health issues are seen, particularly drug dependency) etc etc. We risk many lives be digging in our heels and waiting.

But if we 'hold out' because we know this is a way to simply distract from overarching broad social problems, then we inherently reinforce those issues and prevent them being addressed?  (Im Australian so we have higher welfare expenditure but our social mobility is slowing sadly its not what it used to be, but we have free healthcare etc so its within this climate)  

I just want to know peoples thoughts as studying honours is SO ISOLATING then add COVID and its like being given a sheet of paper saying ""do this"" and being sat alone in a room with a PC.

At this time Im working on a method to answer this question. Opinions are welcome but I really don't have an answer either way and thats good, I just want to unpack the question through research. I am just trying to learn how too.",1,2020-05-12 07:20:22

To preface, I am absolutely in love with doing research. In the face of COVID, my lab has started to run a lot of different projects and I have taken the lions share of responsibility in maintaining the study (I.e., survey design, data management, data cleaning, data analysis), while also working on quite a few other projects on the side. One thing that worries me is that I've found it impossible for me to step away from my work. For example, when trying to take a mental health day I will be continually checking my phone and email to put out potential fires that arise without me being there.

I've been accused of academic dishonesty,"[I was sent an email](http://imgur.com/gallery/88kJNFv) from my professor claiming I had violated the academic integrity standards of our university. I really don't know what to do and I have had terrible anxiety over this since I got the email. Here is the backstory:

I took the final exam and did decently well. My friend did not take the final exam on the date it was given. She asked for an extension and the prof gave her an extension of one hour. She took two days to complete the exam. She submitted her exam and received an email saying that it is too late and there are clear indications that she collaborated with others (assuming me). A few days later I get that email. I have been reading about these things and honestly do not know what to do. I was under the assumption that students were innocent of violations until proven guilty, but it seems like that is not the case and all that is necessary is reasonable suspicion?? She did not copy off of my exam, but we are close and have studied together quite often throughout the semester. My professor also declined to tell me what his ""proof"" is or if I am in fact being accused of giving the answers or something entirely different. I did not post online about the exam, and I did not send her my exam. But I do not have my work from the exam since it was online, and I am extremely worried they will ask me a question on the spot and I will be too anxious to answer and they will consider that proof. I really don't know how this works or what to do. I am trying to get into a very competitive program at my university and a violation like this would completely ruin my chances. I know there is no damning evidence, but I also have no idea how to prove my innocence?? If I am in a he said/she said with the professor, I fear I will lose the hearing. Should I get a lawyer to help me with this? Should I be aggressive and act overly angry to communicate my outrage? I have had problems with this professor throughout this semester and actually sent an email about my concerns to the dean ( this was a couple days before I got reported). I'm worried that my obvious contempt will work against me. I actually had contacted the dean because I had some very bad stuff happen to close family members of mine to which the professor showed no sympathy, and I was saying that his class has been bad for my mental health as I have been working through this traumatizing event. Combined with this I am absolutely emotional drained, overwhelmed and scared. I feel like a deer in headlights and that there is no way for me to prove that I did not do this.

This weekend he had an episode and constantly gave me negative feedback and criticism for an hour or so. His point was that I will not get a postdoc given my productivity and I should think deeper.

There I had an issue with a professor disclosing my mental health information and I filed a complaint. This complaint has haunted me ever since I made it and I am afraid of retaliation of the part of the professor because he is in my field and I want to apply for PhD programs. After my complaint, he told me I was semi-literate idiot and that I could not read books. Because of my mental health issues, I have had a hard time regaining my confidence after this episode. I am still productive in terms of reading and writing, but it is hard to continue on knowing that no matter what I do, most people will think I am an illiterate bastard  in my field.

k34ete,stopmkngsense,t2_5xaucbf6,Should I Stay or Should I Go? Thinking about quitting my PhD (UK),"TL;DR - 2nd year student on the verge of quitting, after a cavalcade of things going wrong. Physical and mental health issues have been both a cause and symptom of these difficulties. Haven't enjoyed the PhD at all so far and am still really unclear what I am researching. Is it time to quit?

. . . . .

Hi, I am in the 2nd year of my PhD. Much has gone wrong from the start - people often laugh wryly if I say this and say that's not unusual, but it seems amiss that I have barely enjoyed it at all and have been unable to get stuck into my research. I am concerned that maybe doing a PhD is not right for me - or at least this project isn't, in these circumstances, right now. 

I am constantly battling with trying to keep going, thoughts of being a failure if I quit, and gratitude that I have a funded PhD, so an obligation to just crack on with it - but I also have a nagging sense that although it's meant to be really hard work, it's probably not meant to be quite so awful?! With apologies for the long read, I would really appreciate some viewpoints. 

I have been really stressed throughout my PhD. I felt able to embark on it because of a good working relationship with my main supervisor (it was a research project specifically created by them and based on their work), who promptly left within a few weeks of me starting. For various reasons they weren't able to maintain long distance contact and help me get on track, so I lost their specific knowledge and key networks. I had more tricky upheaval with the remainder of my supervisors too (I'm cautious about going into specifics so as not to identify them) and major problems to resolve with how we worked together.

I now have a nice, sharp-thinking lead supervisor, but who is only tenuously connected to my area of study, and as a very senior academic has very little time to guide me. I have felt like I have been on my own with this PhD throughout, and while I get that is the nature of independent research, I feel I could have done with a bit more input. I feel like I am flailing and lacking direction, though I also recognise my responsibility in this, and often give myself a hard time wondering how I could have done or do it differently (for example, I know there are some key skills I should have worked harder on last year), or just berate myself for being ill so much.

The stress, which is bad enough that I'm now signed off sick and means I'm behind with a key milestone, has negatively affected my relationship with my partner, overall mental health, and, frustratingly, my ability to read and write (which previously were things I loved). I have also been physically ill for much of the PhD (which has resulted in taking time out), and it is hard to separate out what is causing what issue. I can't concentrate, my memory has become really bad and I quickly feel overwhelmed. I have very little energy and motivation, and can get quite low, which makes it hard to feel bold and enthusiastic in my research work, and my organisation (of my ideas and papers) is as a result pretty terrible. 

I have however been able to do a small amount of teaching which I'd say was a mixed success, I've done some fieldwork, received ethical approval, got through year 1 milestones, have been to the odd conference, and formed a working relationship with an industry partner despite inherent difficulties there (a collaboration which I have sadly now lost due to Covid, though in honesty it was not exactly thriving).

I had a research plan which felt a bit tenuous but that I hoped I could bluff / fake it until I make it, despite the supervisory issues and issues with my industry partner - until Covid hit. Now I am needing to change the research significantly so that I can continue through Covid (it involved international research, practical group work etc), while managing a stressful home situation compounded by being more at risk from Covid due to my health issues. I have stalled. I am keenly aware that I need to make progress, that I cannot manage without the income provided by the funding, and also that my funder requires me to have an industry partner.

But it could also be a great opportunity to redirect my research to something I can feel motivated about, if only I could find the energy and self-belief, and work out what to tackle first. Equally, I am not a young student and I am keenly aware of the opportunity cost too (and health cost) of bashing my head against a PhD that isn't working. I know I sound sorry for myself but I am hoping that by laying it out like this, someone more experienced might be able to pinpoint what I could do to make it work, or whether I should call it a day.

I applied for a (non-academic) short-term job recently and noticed an upswing in my mood, from being interviewed for an area I'm skilled in, and a remote Covid-safe job with achievable set tasks each day, that I feel I could manage despite the issues described above. I am so tired of feeling like a self-doubting loser (which again I understand can be part of pushing the boundaries of new knowledge!). They offered me the job and are currently chasing up references etc. I could do whatever hours at work I wanted, so it could be feasible to still do the PhD (or do it part-time). But equally, I could suspend or leave my PhD.

Very grateful for any thoughts, challenges or suggestions! Thanks.",1,2020-11-29 06:11:45
mt60r,[deleted],,Feeling lost with life goals - want to go back to school,"I received my BA in 2010 in American Studies with a minor in Education. I want to eventually be a professor in American history in the long term, did some K-12 tutoring and test writing and stuff, but the jobs never lasted long. The state of education in this country is frighteningly poor. I decided not to pursue being a K-12 teacher because my school district was handing out pink slips left and right. Now higher education jobs are few and far between. Literally thousands of people are applying for one job. I love history with all my heart, but I worry about walking out with a Master's and a thesis, and the job market being this fierce.

In the meantime, I (barely) pay the bills by working at a cemetery. There's not a lot of engaging activities for me within this particular company (ie their policies and the like), but I do like doing some of the grief counseling aspects, working with people. My ex was a disabled Army veteran, and I found it really fascinating on an intellectual level, to gain insight into his mental processes as he struggled with readjusting to civilian life. I would try to get information out of him, but he always got a little bit weary as I'd try to pick his brain (he doesn't like psychiatrists). I realized that like working with people in crisis. I need a new job, so I've started looking for work in treatment and grief/counseling centers, start off as a clerk or an admin assistant, and working on volunteering at the VA or with other vet centers. 

The question I have is that if I wanted to pursue something in this field, academically, I really enjoy doing research work, and I love academia, writing papers (I never thought I'd live to see the day that I'd miss writing papers). I don't know which field I'd go into if I either did a second BA or an MA. I was thinking either Psychology or Sociology. I was looking at my original field, American Studies, but like Sociology, that'd be an overview. Mental health is a field that is expected to have some growth over the next few years, too. I made an appointment at the local university to get some advising. 

I was wondering if anyone had any ideas. I feel really lost not being in school anymore and it's hard not to feel discouraged in this economy. I've emailed my old college advisors, but they've just told me that I should go back to grad school. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1,2011-11-29 08:55:23

Nothing to do with my PhD, I already had problems before. But it got slightly worse during the PhD. The specific problem is obvious to me, although the solution isn't clear at all - I always feel like I'm not doing my best. I feel like I'm not working hard enough unless I spend most of my day working. I always try to aim for 8 hours a day, but I rarely can - I start to feel anxious, stressed, about my work. That it isn't good enough, that I'm going to fail, that I'm a fraud, etc. I simply don't feel good about my work. don't get me wrong, I love academia and I don't see myself doing anything else. But exactly because of that, I'm afraid of failing. Of not being able to get a job after my contract is over. Of someone finding out a crucial error on my methods, particularly now that I'm starting to develop independent work that it isn't supervised by anyone.  

On top of that, my social life sucks. I don't have many friends, due to moving to another country. My hobbies are mostly lonely activities. And, to make things worse, I'm in a country where I don't speak the main language. I'm learning the language, but it will take long before I can actually maintain a conversation in this language. I have a dog, and helps me a bit. But it isn't enough. Dating has been hard too - either I don't find people interesting enough, or - when I do - they don't find me interesting enough. 

I don't know what can help me. I just feel hopeless. I know that a permanent job - for instance, a tenure-track position - would help me a lot by creating some stability in my life, by allowing me to develop relationships without the fear of losing later on when I have to move. But that's something that I can do very little about, and I'm afraid that my state of mind will sabotage my chances.

jzibk9,greensourgrapes,t2_5g926490,Thoughts on Mid-PhD life crisis/supervisory issues.,"Long one...Sorry folks! I have two issues hanging over my head as a PhD student, and I know I’m probably not alone. 

Do you ever feel like you’re just not cut out for the Academia route mid-PhD but then freak out and wonder what this all means then? I am motivated by the research but disenfranchised by the politics and lack of job security. I’ll never be the best in my field, nor do I think my current lack of balance/mental health is worth it. Has anybody had any experience with this, and perhaps gone a non-academic route post PhD that they’re willing to share?

To make matters worse, I feel constantly at odds with my supervisory team. I feel like we communicate on two different planes (I’m the sensitive and overly nice type, they’re the direct and/or somewhat aggressive type/s). They question my progress and negatively skew a lot of our interactions (highlight what I do wrong, and not what I do right). Which is in turn hindering my progress more. Does anyone have any experience or advice (and no, I don’t have the opportunity to change supervisors) on how to manage this? I’m at the point where my meetings with them is causing me large amounts of stress. I’m basically losing confidence by the minute in my abilities. If I successfully complete, I wonder how much this aspect of my PhD is impacting my overall negative attitude of Academia - I have heard of more positive experiences in external labs. 

I have a committee I will meet early next year to assess my progress and normally you would bring up these issues with them. But I am in such a niche field and I know my committee would know my supervisory team very well - I worry it might be bad taste to voice my concerns.

dg6idi,dubiouslyevil,t2_19yy90d7,feeling really stupid and lost about mental health issues,"TL;DR at bottom 

Shits hit the fan with me mental health-wise. I’ve always been a student who could power through nearly anything and get an A. But due to issues in my personal life and with my mental health, 

I’m a complete mess like I’ve never been before. I can hardly focus, I can hardly retain information, and on bad days I immediately begin to have a panic attack when I open up a textbook for one of my classes. I’m trying to learn Mandarin this semester and I got a C on our first midterm. I’m not surprised, but seeing that mark broke me because I’m trying so flipping hard but just getting nowhere. 

What the hell should I do? I had to leave my class this morning ten minutes in because I suddenly started to bawl and became inconsolable, and I’ve remained in this state of panic all day long (if my post reads like a freakout, that’s why). I recently had to get an extension on a heavily-weighted assignment for another one of my classes because I’m apparently such a dumbass that I can’t even get that done. 

I feel like such a failure and now I’m wasting that prof’s time by making him mark my assignment at a later date. I’m constantly swamped in work. I have no space to breath or heal. And I feel this deep and suffocating sense of guilt. I’m wasting a spot in a university that some other, better and more capable student could be using. I’m wasting all of my profs’ time. All I do is make people around me at the university uncomfortable because I’m either on the verge of tears or I’m already crying. 

And this is all my stupid fault. I wanted to go to grad school but I’ll be lucky if I’m even alive by next year at this point. 

TL;DR: I’ve been experiencing a mental health crisis since the start of this semester and it’s becoming clear that I have been rendered academically useless. No idea where to go from here.",1,2019-10-10 23:34:40
dgixtw,redditblink,t2_3z8ko1kp,How does one justify a readmission after mental health concerns ?,"Long story short,  I was place on a suspension leave after a couple of mental health concerns however, I actually have the medical documents to disclose otherwise I am not a threate to their community and have gotten help for infact four years of my life after pstd episodes.

 This actually lead me to have experience in social services work, which is a common feild for students with past traumas.

I even had a mental health check done on me because the school went as far to threaten police involvement cause I spoke about feeling to abuse by the way the school was trying to get me mental help as a result of me just mentioning my experience was un pleasant.

actual police and court system isn't gonna go that far with me like that.  Police was actually extremely kind to me about my mental health and let me be,police was actually understanding that the situation did not made me feel safe.Also discussed this with numerous of counselor, who have stated no concerns on me being readmitted to this college. 

For now my basic plan is the following. 

Go to a back up school in Canada and not work in socail services ever, even though I am a people person everything I went through in that program just made me cringe hard.

  My plan right now is to get a job and just take break from school due to holiday seasons approaching.  

I had called back early to try to justify my means of return because I am exceeding well with the general public and their concerns do not match how I am actually doing.

Even my posting on public social media are generally well received which shouldn't even be a problem since I am not using this against the school.  This never was an issues in my most of my academia life since at one point I went to school without socail media, I am not dependent on it one of the few young ones not constantly using it.   

The only concern I have attempted to raise with the school is that every time I post on the matter, I get troll comments and a letter from the school to stay quite and govern self. Obivous they disagree.",1,2019-10-11 18:09:17

One option is to continue trying to skate by without having done the readings, and hope the professor doesn't notice.

I applied to grad school last year to MSW program because I always thought i would want to be a social worker BUT because of my own mental health issues dropped out of school before starting realizing maybe working with trauma centered work was not for me as I just wanted mental happiness BUT I was still passionate about advocating for mental illness via research (Indirectly) via PhD social work or developmental psych.

Also I feel like To be an academic as a first gen student of color must be a big milestone for our communities via teaching young minds/students and inspiring them with rich advice and knowledge about things you care about... although there are days where I’m like is academia really the best route to take?

e8gbka,Gemini725,t2_3u2gyd0n,My Letter to the Dept. Chair (Analysis and Insights Welcome)," Here is the letter I wrote to the department chair.  I thought I'd post this to give everyone a better idea of the situation.  I'd like to get people's opinions on whether it seems that they professor was instructed not to interact with me, if I should have been allowed to reconcile with her afterwards etc. However, please abide by the rules of the sub. For example, please keep your comments civil. This includes not telling me to ""get help,"" (that's not an expression of concern or empathy but a way of telling someone they're crazy), attempting to diagnose mental health conditions beyond what I've self-disclosed, and keeping comments civil. (You're welcome to disagree, offer honest opinions, but I will not  tolerate personal attacks.)

\*Consider that these events were fresh at this time and less time had passed since having a class with this professor. (I was still adjusting  to possibly never seeing her again.)

Dear Dr. \_\_\_\_I am writing in regards to some experiences I've had with Dr.\_\_\_.  The first incident was when I met with her on \_\_\_,2018. I had asked her in an email if she would be my graduate advisor and she suggested we meet in person to discuss it. She greeted me warmly, but then snapped  ""What did you want to ask me?"" (It's hard to convey the tone in an email, but I perceived it as ""cold."")  Although a bit taken aback, I  asked her to be my advisor. She then instantaneously regained her composure as she explained why should could not. The rest of the semester went well, and I wrote her a stellar evaluation (overlooking her momentary irritability). 

The next incident was at the end of the semester. I had asked for a one to two day extension on a paper (As you know, I experienced significant stress due to my housing situation last semester.) Although it was granted, she told me that she ""was not pleased"" with having to grant it, and again, her tone turned cold (but warmed up once I submitted the paper). A professor should not express personal dissatisfaction with a student. I received an A- on the paper (and an A in the course), so I want to emphasize that I'm not retaliating against a grade.  About a week later, I wrote her asking if I could contact her in the future for a letter of recommendation to graduate school. Based on her ""lukewarm"" reply (in which she ignored my comment about being inspired by her research and classes), I assumed that I was not going to receive the letter, and this caused me anxiety.

In April, I submitted a proposal to the\_\_\_ Association (which as accepted for presentation at their annual meeting). After having trouble finding volunteers, I recently contacted the\_\_\_\_ Center at \_\_\_ and spoke to someone there (I do not wish to reveal their identity) who suggested that I contact Dr. \_\_\_\_ She  described her as being ""very active in the community and \_Association"" and implied that Dr. would be happy to help. Instead, however, I received a curt reply. The reason was ostensibly that I submitted the proposal before securing narrators. While I can certainly understand her disapproval of such action, I thought her tone was disproportionately harsh.

 Still, I tried to understand her perspective, so I emailed her again offering to withdraw the proposal. Being an amateur at oral history (this was my first attempt), I am not familiar with conference/research protocols, but I certainly understand her not agreeing with my actions. I even described them in the email as being  ""impulsive"" and ""imprudent"" and wanted to at least leave on good terms with her, but she ignored that email altogether.Although I only had two classes with her, I thought highly of her and had expressed my sentiment both to her directly (i.e. telling her how much I admired her work) and to many faculty members (including in my statement of purpose to the M.A. history program at\_\_\_). I. It is one thing to let a student know that you do not approve of their behavior (i.e. regarding the proposal), but it should be done politely and professionally. I would like this situation addressed, and I am hoping to reach an amicable resolution.

 Sincerely,

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Through an ongoing mental health condition, I have seem to lost my enthusiasm for my subject (Physics). In addition to that, I am feeling like my specialization does not contribute to society. I don't see any possible applications of my skillset and I don't know where to start looking.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey r/AskAcademia !

I recently graduated with a [B.Sc](https://B.Sc). in Physics from a European school, and I am currently a visiting grad student at a University at the west coast of the US. While finishing my Bachelor's degree, I started feeling unsatisfied with what I was doing, and frankly started developing a pretty toxic mindset towards physics. I got influenced by brilliant people around me, who were mathematicians - they kept telling me how physicists got it all wrong and how physics is just simplified mathematics. I adapted this mindset (**not proud of that**) and started focusing strongly on pure math in my further studies.

This had a pretty negative effect on me, as I recently realized: I don't enjoy doing physics anymore. I get put off by minor shortcomings (for example, I hated learning QFT, because nobody could give me a clear definition of a path integral. Or I didn't like my class on general Relativity, because we didn't cover the geometry I was interested in). I don't even really care for the underlying physics anymore. This resulted in me not putting in the required work for these classes, even failing some of them. 

I keep telling myself that I will switch my focus to pure math, and I am applying to programs in mathematical physics. That does however open up another problem: Apart from not feeling intellectually unfit for a career in math (I know that's largely due to my mental health, so I am trying to not pay too much attention to it - also I recognize a big chunk of internalized arrogance implying that pure math is in some sense more challenging than other areas of science, which certainly is wrong), I am also struggling to see meaning in working on theoretical foundations of either mathematics or theoretical physics. By meaning, I mean a significant contribution to enhancing the living conditions of our society within a timespan of several decades.

This sense of futility has finally destroyed the last straw I was holding on to - the joy of doing pure math. I have arrived at a point where the only thing that is making me hold onto academia is the memory of how much I enjoyed it just a couple of months ago. I'm certain that my current condition is largely due to my mental health condition (which I won't go into, just know that I am seeking treatment, but am on a long waitlist). I would like however to find a way to reignite my passion for science. I really want to make a difference, and I have received strong encouragement during my bachelor's degree - so I don't think I am entirely unfit. Maybe the best way would be to switch subjects towards a more applied discipline, or to find a way to apply the abstract mathematics I like to the real world.

I hope this makes any sense - I would appreciate help of any sort, may it a link to some self-help resources, articles, organizations, reports of your own experiences. I hope I made my problem clear without whining too much!

f0ea9m,smitha30,t2_5mfrvrii,"Might master out, need advice","I need advice on what I should do. I am in my first year of my PhD program and I am unbelievably unhappy and unsure if mastering out is the right choice. I don't want time off and would apply for other PhD programs in the fall of my 2nd year if I went this route.  


Summary of my reasons to master out:

1.) The program is completely not what I was expecting. Basically there are no ugrads and I cant recruit my own.. basically I am running all of my projects on my own at an R1 school with those same expectations. This is basically impossible and my advisor makes me feel bad when I don't meet his goals (but I can't run all the participants by myself). I also had to fight and defend myself for wanting/needing an office space--I don't even get a key to the door because they don't want to spend the money making it. The school doesn't like giving things to the program and is more focused on other things (clinical students &amp; sports). On another note, my stipend is incredibly low and is barely enough for me to live on. I knew this coming in, but I was guaranteed summer funding and travel funding from my advisor and upon my first semester was told that I will be getting neither of these.

2.) My advisor was very unsupportive when I lost two grandparents and had to travel home for funerals/being with family. I was extremely close to one of them and it wrecked me when she died and I had to grieve. When it came to then end of the semester and I hadn't met the goals I was told that it was my fault that I didn't meet the expectations. I was told that my advisor understood that I was dealing with a lot but that I need to essentially grieve on my own time and focus on school during set hours. I've also addressed my mental health and it has been blown off numerous times and just told thanks for letting them know.

3.) My advisor started me off with 2 first-year projects and I came in with one I wanted to do. The first one is now being written up for pub and he started out saying I would be 1st author.. that now switched to my advisor taking 1st author. The reasoning being that it was an idea before I came in.. but i was told by my advisor that a previous student got 1st because he did all the work (programming, running participants, analyzing data, writing it up). Now I am in the same position doing all the work and my advisor is taking 1st author. I don't want to address it due to the fact that if I master out.. I need a letter of rec from him.

4.) My advisor isn't focused in the research I want to do.. they were willing to work on it and interested and wanted to get into what I want to do. But since coming here that hasn't been the case. Part of me wants to master out and apply to someone more involved in what I want to do.

egg9y0,academiclady,t2_umzhl,[UPDATE] How to deal with students coming to me at the end of the semester to tell me they had mental health issues during the semester and would like some leniency in the grading? - Bamboozled edition,"A week ago [I asked for some advice](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/ed17at/how_to_deal_with_students_coming_to_me_at_the_end/) about how to handle the students coming to me at the end of the semester asking for help and leniency with their grades because they had ""mental health"" issues during the semester.

The advice from the sub was clear and sound: sorry, students, unless you have documentation and/or let me know ahead of time that this was an issue, you can't get special treatment retroactively. I felt good about that.

Then one of the students cornered me. They were waiting for me at the end of the final exam. We were alone and they asked to speak to me. They had sent me their final paper over ten days late. Since I take 10% of the grade for every day it's late, it was an automatic zero and they begged me to reconsider and look at the paper and give them some credit. 

They explained they are taking five courses and they need to work because they are from an impoverished background (this much I actually know is true). The student is actually quite talented, but because of many absences and missed assignments, they were just barely passing the class. I knew of this student's background and actually did try to keep an eye out for them, but it didn't help much. I stood my ground and said the paper would not count, they would have to take their D and that was it. It wasn't fair to the other students who also had hard semesters, etc.

However, some things lingered in my mind from the conversation. I thought about it constantly all week. The first thing was what felt like a story of him pulling himself out of poverty by getting himself into this special scholarship program at college. They are a talented student, and I didn't want to feel like I was sabotaging their future. And with all that school work plus a job, I mean, who wouldn't have mental health problems, right?

The second part was that they kept talking about how hard they worked on that paper. This is what really got me. His first paper for the class had been very good, but also so late they didn't get much credit for it. There were several students who handed in no final paper at all and got a zero just like this student, and I started to think, why should someone who worked really hard but was held back by other responsibilities and understandable emotional stress be penalized the same way? I thought that might not be fair after all.

I'd already submitted the final grades, but I prepared the change of grade form with all but the new grade and sat down to read their paper. The first odd thing I notice of this paper that this student had two more weeks than they others to write, was that is was very short - half the length it was supposed to be. Then I started reading. It was bad, but also...familiar. It was almost a carbon copy of a group project paper from earlier in the semester with just one new paragraph added. Plus, this paper included all the mistakes from the first paper that I corrected when I graded it! There I was, on Christmas no less, taking my day to try to save this kids career and I got completely bamboozled!

Needless to say, he got his D. And I will be bringing up this paper with the chair of the department as possible academic misconduct. I'm such an idiot!",1,2019-12-27 20:19:04
eb4g32,miyaav,t2_iofj4lq,Help to answer about possibility of getting involved with academic project as a non-academician that will lead to work in the research/ academic field later?,"I got a master degree in new media/ digital media in 2017 from a university in Turkey, where i wrote a thesis related to smartphone and blind people in a city with inadequate infrastructure (I am indonesian, also where the research took place).

After that, i decided that i wanted to work in turkey first before continuing with academia (bcs i live here with my turkish husband). My plan was to work, building a little network while considering about what kind of doctorate study i really want to do. However i could not get any job offer, somehow contributing to worsen my mental health. 

I started to volunteer physically and online and then, thinking that i wanted to work in a digital media/ child education related research, i applied for unis for another master in child education in UK (bcs i dont have background in education, so getting phd in that area was not even an idea i thought about) and two high-end scholarships (bcs those were the only one i knew). What i had in mind was to join think tank, or any research-based work later on. I got an offer from KCL and Leeds but was rejected by the scholarships). So i did not take the opportunity after failing to find another scholarship.

I still try looking for another unis sometimes but i feel like I don't have anyone to be my referee anymore bcs nobody really knows me professionally/ academically in the recent years, bcs i work alone at home (writing/ translating), and only attend short-term courses unrelated to all these.

Right now, i cannot think of any way to reach academia back (let alone scholarship, even though i also know that i won't be able to pay tuition on my own) to reach my goal of being a researcher and academician. Is there even a possibility for me to get any opportunity as a stepping stone for a work in the research field in the future?

Like i tried to send an offer to volunteer with a study center, it did not get any response (is that a mistake?). I kind of think that maybe i can offer a translation or assisting other things in the beginning. Is that possible? If so, how should i start? Who should i contact? Etc.

Hope to get some serious insight here. Thank you.",1,2019-12-15 20:48:16
e8befo,groovypuppies,t2_wkef8,"Looking for some advice on possibly getting two PhDs, or a second MSc before a PhD","First for context, I am a Canadian student. I think maybe grad school is done a bit differently in other countries like the USA. So in Canada it is common to get a masters degree first and then do the PhD.

I will be finishing up my MSc in physics next semester. I've been having some issues with mental health and so I haven't been looking into what I want to do a PhD on and where I want to do it as much I should have. My goal is to get a PhD in (theoretical) physics but I am really hesitant to jump into a PhD without looking into what exactly I want to study. I feel really lost about it at the moment. Also I know some deadlines to apply to schools to start next fall have already happened.

There is another option that feels like the right thing to do. There is a math professor who I have done undergrad summer research with and I have taken a couple math classes with him and he's super great to work with. He studies quantum systems and I think his research is really interesting. So I figured it would be a good idea to do a MSc in math under his supervision before I went on to my PhD. I think it would be an opportunity to learn something new and exciting, even if it didn't directly relate to what I want to do for a PhD. I am in school because I want to learn.

I emailed him about it and we had a meeting, and he strongly thinks I should do my PhD with him. He said I could do a masters with him but he seems far less enthusiastic about that. 

So now I am really confused. I want to do my PhD in physics. I've read that it's not good to do two PhDs. But it also seems like fields where it is at least a bit more common to have two PhDs in are math and physics, so maybe it's ok in this case. I am really worried that if I do decide to do a PhD in math, no one will take me as a PhD student in physics after. If I did the PhD in math and not a PhD in physics, then I don't think I would have a hope in hell of ever being in academia as a physicist. Another problem is that I would be getting all three degrees from the same university if I didn't do a PhD physics after, which I read also negatively affects employability. Third, I am worried about burning out after one PhD and never going on to do the second, then I would be stuck with the PhD that isn't my goal. This third worry might be related to my phenomenally low self esteem lately, so it's hard to tell if I'm being objective about it.

I wanted to do a MSc in math because I thought it would be a really good opportunity that I would enjoy a lot. I thought it would make me a more well-rounded researcher and I could learn a lot of really interesting things, including refining my coding skills. Also it would give me a bit of time to think about what I want to do for my PhD. I think it could also help with my self esteem.

So please let me know what your thoughts are. I know that the decision is up to me to make. But I would appreciate any guidance. Will I hurt my chances of studying theoretical physics if I get a PhD in math? Will it be hard to find a PhD supervisor if I already have one PhD? Writing this all out, I guess I am leaning towards doing the MSc in math, but how would I go about telling the math professor this, when he really thinks the PhD is the right way to go? I am upset to let him down. I know it's my life and I shouldn't let anyone's feelings get in the way, but I am worried it would be hard to study under someone who I might have disappointed. So any advice on how to discuss this with the math professor if I do decide I only want the MSc in math would be appreciated. Any advice or thoughts about what I've typed up here would be appreciated. I feel really lost and confused and I've been crying a lot over the past few days. Thanks so much.",1,2019-12-09 15:31:05
e6rn8d,throwawayaita9,t2_55yuv2z3,is the uni to blame for what happened at my uni?,"This is basically what happened to me at my uni, and they've decided to leave me unable to receive a degree from any uni (they know this). Can the uni really claim me being unable to recieve a degree as a result of all of this is my fault? (i know ive been a slight ahole in this situation, but staff have kept lying to the uni to cover things up)

&amp;nbsp;

My personal tutor always mentioned how odd it was that I did better in coursework and the essay part of the exam than I did in the MCQ part. I noticed this myself when I looked at the module breakdowns, which showed other students scored higher in the MCQ than they did in the essay/coursework.  Throughout Level 1 and Semester 1 of Level 2, my coursework and essay marks were higher than my MCQ marks. During the Semester 2 exams I noticed some of the MCQs were formatted in a way which would disadvantage some students. I emailed my personal tutor highlighting this, and gave examples of how they could be made better. My personal tutor responded by telling me I raised some very important points. So given all of this, there clearly is an issue with how the department format MCQs.

&amp;nbsp;
 
In my Semester 2 exams I ran out of time because I was unwell and couldn’t think clearly, it literally felt like I hadn’t taken my meds in months. My semester 2 exam essays were incomplete, which meant I performed worse in the essays compared to the MCQs in the exams. On one morning during the exam period I felt too unwell to attend my exam, so I emailed the Support Officer. I was told to apply for mitigating circumstances, so I did.

 &amp;nbsp;

When I read the mitigating circumstances guidance I noticed there was a list of outcomes, which included alternative assessments and that it was granted by the School (the School’s Pro Dean of Student Education). So when I applied for mitigating circumstances, I ticked the ‘D – other please state’ box and requested an alternative assessment instead of resits. I presumed if an alternative assessment wasn’t going to be granted resits would. If someone asks for mustard instead of ketchup, and you have no mustard, you give them ketchup, not oil.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Level 2 admin sent me the School’s Special Cases Committee letter on the 2nd of July, which didn’t mention the exams. I asked Level 2 admin about the Semester 2 exams I applied for since it was missing from the letter. Level 2 admin told me all the exams were included in the letter. I assumed she may not know, so I asked Support Officer since she was the one I sent the form to.

&amp;nbsp;
 
Support Officer told me I applied for consideration of circumstances, not resits. Support Officer asked me which exams I wanted to sit, so I told her the Semester 2 exams I wanted to sit. Disability tutor started emailing me, and told me I could not get mitigation. Disability tutor then admitted I did have grounds for mitigation from that form, and told me to appeal and ask for resits or consideration of circumstances. So given he told me I couldn’t get mitigation, and then told me to appeal and ask for consideration of circumstances, I thought I was never granted mitigation… why else would he be telling me to request consideration of circumstances?
 
&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I raised the same points about the format of MCQs with Disability tutor, and he kept referring them as “your perceived issues”. I got upset about this, because it was not appropriate for Disability tutor, especially considering he’s a disability tutor, to be referring to issues a disabled student raises in a derogatory way and preventing them from being able to discuss them. I also raised these points with R from Disability Services, but she wouldn’t discuss this with me. I got upset about this, because Disability tutor was stopping me from being able to discuss my points with R. It was only in the first week of August that R let me meet with her to discuss this, after I pointed out that it was unfair decisions were being made without me being allowed to have an input, and without Disability tutor or R even meeting with me (I’d never met R at this point). During that meeting R told me the issues I raised would be a problem, but this was something the School should be taking into consideration when setting exams. Essentially, if I was allowed to have that discussion with Disability Services sooner, and if Disability tutor didn’t use derogatory language in his references to them, I wouldn’t have gotten so upset.
 
&amp;nbsp;

I emailed personal tutor complaining about Disability tutor correspondence with me and how he had been approaching me throughout the year. I mentioned how anxiety provoking it was when he’d sent me passive aggressive emails earlier in the year, and how he kept brining up temporary leave in inappropriate ways. Disability tutor kept bringing up temporary leave during July/August too, after I had complained about him doing this and how he was making me uncomfortable in doing so.
 
&amp;nbsp;

So throughout July and August, not only was I upset thinking I was never granted mitigation (especially because of the tone of the email Disability tutor sent), and having legitimate concerns being disregarded, I was also becoming increasingly upset and frustrated about staff’s refusal to enter me for exams. Support officer had asked me which exams I wanted to sit, so I told her thinking I would be entered for the ones I asked to be entered for. But as she was on holiday Disability tutor had started emailing me instead, and he kept refusing to enter me when I asked, but then I also had disability services telling me I could be sitting twice as many exams since exams were split. So I asked for them to be unsplit because I didn’t want Disability tutor to use that as an excuse to stop me from being entered. I told both Disability tutor and Disability my rationale for asking them to be unsplit – that it would be easier and less stressful than twice as many exams. LUU even told them unsplit would be a better option. So me, LUU and Disability all thought I was going to be entered for exams, and then Disability tutor kept refusing to enter me. Note, this was before I submitted my appeal. So I asked the Deputy Head of School (HoS was on holiday) if I could be entered, she refused. Then I asked the Director of Student Education, and she refused. Note, all the emails I have show staff wanting to offer me resits, asking the disability tutor and then him saying I’m not capable – because hes made incorrect assumptions about me based on a conversation we had over 2 years ago when I was undiagnosed and unmedicated, and included him deciding to incorrectly diagnose me
 
&amp;nbsp;

On the 13th of August I went into the School of Psychology to see if my personal tutor, was available because the situation had distracted and upset me making it difficult to do work. As she wasn’t in her office, I went to the general office to ask if anyone knew if she was available, Support officer and Disability tutor were in there (Two other members of staff were in there too – I think one was XYZ, not sure about the other, but I know they were doing UCAS offers). Support officer said she should be in her office, I said I already checked and she wasn’t there, they asked if I wanted to speak to them instead. I said “no, not really” but I still went with them to another room (XYZ laughed at my joke so I clearly wasn’t being rude when I went in).
 
&amp;nbsp;

I went with Disability tutor and Support officer to another room. I was sitting, they were both standing by the door, they kept giving me excuses despite my being there being to do with trying to get help from my personal tutor to refocus my attention, because I was already upset with what was going on and two members of staff. At one point Disability tutor kept repeatedly saying “but am I right but am I right but am I right but am I right”, and I ended up getting frustrated and calling him a “fucking fascist” because he wouldn’t shut up. Disability tutor asked me to leave, so I did.
 
&amp;nbsp;

I got half way down the steps of the Psychology building and decided I’d had enough of Disability tutor and the situation, and wanted to talk to Head of School. So I went back in (this was less than 5 minutes after being asked to leave), and Head of School, Support officer and Disability tutor were all in the foyer of the Psychology building discussing me. I asked Head of School if I could talk to him, he knew who I was and offered to meet with me an hour later.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I returned an hour later. While waiting Disability tutor left Head of School’s office. During that meeting HoS kept giving me excuses, and I had to correct every single incorrect assumption he had made about me and my ability. After I had to correct him HoS said “I’ll have to check the dates”, implying he was going to enter me, until I mentioned it was already half way through the exam period. I explained to HoS that I needed certain grades in some modules for the course I wanted to do when I graduated, and my only other option would be transferring into third year at another university in September but it would be a difficult given the short period of time. HoS then told me I would be able to resit those exams during or after Level 3, and I would have to compromise with a delayed graduation. He also mentioned how the School “work closely with Trinity” and he may be able to pull a few strings. A few days later I asked for confirmation of this, and I kept being communicated with as though this was allowed, even the School’s response to my first appeal gave no indication that it wasn’t allowed. So given no one made any indication that it wasn’t allowed, and it was the Head of School who told me it was, I believed it was allowed.

&amp;nbsp;
 
After the August resit period I still had 3 pieces of coursework left, but because of all the confusion, distraction and upset already caused by all of the above I hadn’t been able to focus on it. As a result of disabilities I had to restart the work – if I picked up where I left off I would have been making mistakes and getting confused because I struggle to return to things once distracted. So basically, this left me with 1 week to do 3 pieces of coursework. I emailed Support officer the day before to explain the situation (how I had to restart because of disabilities, and the impact this was having on my health since I was having to find time anywhere I could), and she gave me an extra 2 hours. The day of I emailed her again but she was on leave so I had to email Disability tutor. I explained the same thing to him, but he was also on leave so I emailed personal tutor. She contacted DoSE on my behalf, who told me I could have an extra 3 hours, and if I missed this deadline I would get late penalties.
 
&amp;nbsp;

I ended up deciding to take the late penalties since
1. I realised I would get better feedback than what I would have gotten on incomplete coursework, which would have helped improve my grades in Level 3.
2. At the time I thought I could resit those exams during/after Level 3 so I didn’t mind having a few late penalties.
3. I had to cut down on sleeping and eating to do 3 pieces of work in a week, and I needed some time to look after myself, so it was better for me to put my health first
 
*Note: During the week I was finding time where I could, this included having to put off picking up my prescription. I ended up unmedicated for one day (Sunday), and spending that day trying to find a pharmacy which had my medication in stock (it is very difficult to find a pharmacy that has it if you need it the same day… which I needed to be able to do that work, especially given the time of the month – I can actually prove both these things…)

&amp;nbsp;
 
I had the appeal hearing in September 2018. I genuinely believed HoS was going to put me in a better position and I trusted him. During I mentioned how the School included a bunch of irrelevant emails but didn’t include a lot of them. The panel didn’t tell me their decision during the hearing because “a letter would explain it better”. I very vaguely had consideration of circumstances explained to me, but I didn’t understand how it would work to take into consideration and that illness. When I left that meeting Head of Student Cases (HoSC) walked me out and I said “I don’t think they’re on the same page”.

&amp;nbsp;
 
From the Xth of September to the Xth of October I had been emailing DoSE (Director of Student Education and School’s representative during meeting) regarding removing late penalties, or being able to submit the one piece I wasn’t able to do because I wanted feedback. Obviously, I still thought taking Level 2 stuff during/after Level 3 was allowed. Throughout this time, I mentioned how I didn’t think taking it during Level 2 would be an issue, DoSE never told me it wasn’t allowed. Just kept communicating as though it was, and was always avoiding answering questions which would have led to me submitting a second appeal. I emailed personal tutor on the last day about it who said “I think LUUs advice is XXX” (can’t remember the last bit exactly – basically told me to submit an appeal like LUU said – this email wasn’t in the DSAR).


 
On the 10th of October I received the Committee on Applications letter. I got upset because:
1.  The University thought I was offered Semester 2 resits in July for August 2018 when I wasn’t.
2.  The University’s letter used very strong language about how staff had been “exceptionally supportive”, which was not the case at all. Staff were preventing me from having discussions I was entitled to participate in about my disabilities and my degree.
3. I was only offered resits as an external student. I thought I could take resits during Level 3, so I had already enrolled which meant I had used my last year of funding. As a result, I wasn’t able to become an external student – I would have ended up being unable to return in 2019-20 to finish my degree.
4. The University’s letter said I couldn’t take resits during Level 3 “due to the workload this would involve”. This was after I received late penalties having been expected to complete 3 pieces of coursework in one week.
5. I was left with “consideration of circumstances”, which felt like a massive slap in the face. At the time I had no idea I was granted this all along, because I was under the impression I hadn’t been granted it – I was told to appeal and ask for consideration of circumstances.
6. I was left unable to apply for the programme I wanted to do when I graduated and had wasted my time and money trying to be entered for exams.
 
&amp;nbsp;

I emailed HoS and DoSE on the 10th of October asking for a letter saying I was never offered Semester 2 resits for August 2018. I met with DoSE in person on the 11th of October and asked for the letter. They wouldn’t write it. During that meeting I brought up the inappropriate language used by Disability tutor, and when I resent her the email during the meeting and she read it, she changed the subject. When I brought up staff sharing students’ private information she said “this wasn’t that time you started swearing was it?” (in reference to the 13th of August confirming she knew about it). When I mentioned how the School only included those emails in their response to my appeal to make me look bad she said “well they’re not your strongest point”. I asked again for a letter admitting that I was never offered resits, and she refused again. I mentioned how I rescheduled a holiday, had missed out on time with friends, missed out on time with family especially considering during that time there had been an inquest into a family member’s death and how it wasn’t fair that the School lied to the university and I put all that effort in to be entered and they just kept refusing and just got to lie. I was about to cry so I decided to leave, DoSE said “I’m sorry you feel that way” I said “I’m sorry you work with a bunch of liars”. I got upset because I thought it was a reasonable request that the School would help to correct what had been misunderstood.

&amp;nbsp;
 
The letter Student Cases sent with the Committee on Applications outcome had the incorrect date, so I thought I had a week to submit my DVC appeal. I submitted it in less than a week, but then received an email where they corrected this, and was offered to meet with Head of Student Cases. The only reason HoSC met with me was because my Mental Health Advisor (legend) convinced her to, I didn’t put two and two together for a month.
 
&amp;nbsp;

I met with HoS (Head of Student Cases) on the 18th of October, who was encouraging me to appeal to the DVC. She mentioned “it’ll be up to him to decide if there’s any ground for complaint”. I explained how I wasn’t able to become an external student because I didn’t have any funding left. We discussed how letting students resit exams when they had already passed was a University-wide discussion, I said “so no more resits” she said “I didn’t say that”. She knew I would be appealing to ask for resits during/after Level 3, but didn’t tell me it wasn’t permitted within the Uni’s regulations. HoSC told me how she thought I was offered resits but didn’t realise I wasn’t offered resits in July. I also mentioned the swearing incident on the 13th of August and how DoSE had said “this wasn’t that time you started swearing, was it?” and HoSC said “that’s victimisation”.

&amp;nbsp;
 
Anyway, I ended up rewriting my DVC appeal, so I put all the email correspondence in chronological order in PowerPoint. I was going through the appeal file and noticed DoSE had included email correspondence with me. I found the original email and noticed DoSE had cut it off specifically where I asked her to be entered for exams and she refused. I was really angry and upset that DoSE told the University I was offered resits when she clearly knew I wasn’t, and ended up sending some not so great emails to staff in the School. Legend told me to stop so I did.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I submitted a DSAR on the 23rd of October, asking for all emails from staff in the School of Psychology from January 2019 to that day, including permanently deleted emails. I received an email from a member of staff who told me the correct email address to send my DSAR to (can’t remember her name).

&amp;nbsp;
 
On the 30th of October I was sent the case file for my Fitness to Study meeting. I noticed it included an inaccurate attendance record, claiming I hadn’t attended anything, so I emailed Student Cases. I was also questioning why Student Cases wouldn’t sent that case file to my University email address and needed an alternative email. I was becoming increasingly upset and anxious about attending, because I couldn’t trust the School given their track record and how they do things. Even how they included those emails to make me look unfit to study and make me look bad during my appeal. The Fitness to Study meeting was on the 31st of October, and I didn’t end up attending because I knew staff would have tried to make me look unfit to study when I was.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I met with my mental health advisor (legend) on the 1st of November. I was getting really upset because we were discussing how I couldn’t afford to take those resits and how I had kept asking and rescheduled a holiday and so many plans. Legend told me “youre not going to get your resits”. I got really upset for being lied to and misled and because of all the misinformation and miscommunication, and I left. I went to the Psychology department and permanently withdrew on impulse. I went home still angry and sent a shitty email.

&amp;nbsp;
 
The next day (Friday 2nd November) I realised my mistake, and asked HoSC to be reinstated because otherwise I would have been unable to receive a degree. She brought up temporary leave but I got upset because I didn’t trust the School, and wouldn’t have any funding if I did take temporary leave. HoSC got in contact with LUU and got me a better advisor. I emailed and phoned HoS on the 5th of November asking to be reinstated and explained if I didn’t return to finish Level 3 I wouldn’t be able to receive a degree at all as I had no funding left.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I met with the new advisor from LUU on the 7th of November. I was told HoSC was looking to have me be reinstated but she wanted to see good attendance. We also discussed my DVC appeal, and he told me about a student who had previously been allowed to do this.

&amp;nbsp;
 
HoS then told me I didn’t attend any project meetings or lectures. I sent him Uber receipts and FitBit tracking proving I attended. I sent them to HoSC too because I knew she was going to let me continue if I had good attendance.

&amp;nbsp;
 
HoS told me on the Xth of X that I was reinstated as a temporary leaver and I could return in 2019. He told me I could put in a complaint about his decision. I was confident there wasn’t a register and I knew I attended project meetings, so I knew when I submitted that complaint it would be upheld and I could be given free tuition for 2019 to complete my final year.

&amp;nbsp;
 
Around the 20th of November I asked A1 and A2 for an update on my DSAR. A1 replied saying he didn’t receive it, so I forwarded the original email to him again. I didn’t hear back at all.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I realised that I wouldn’t be able to lodge a complaint and return to the School. If the School already treated me in that way as a result of lodging an appeal, they would be worse if I lodged a complaint. I was working full time, trying to find someone to take over my tenancy, trying to figure out how to afford funding, receiving multiple emails/calls/texts from SFE and DSA asking me to repay them for what I had already received when I was already in my overdraft after paying half a years rent out of pocket and rescheduling a holiday, dealing with unexpectedly being put back in a negative environment because of the situation.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I was becoming increasingly upset, frustrated and stressed. I ended up trying to report myself to HoSC for what the School accused me of so I could get a disciplinary hearing and be heard. This was the only way the University would understand that I wasn’t granted mitigation and that I wasn’t offered resits, and the only way the University would realise I did have good attendance and see things from my perspective. She wouldn’t give me a disciplinary so I started sending emails so I would be given one.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I received the School’s response to my second appeal. They took my appeal out of context and tried to accuse me of being in America instead of doing work (I can prove I was in the UK – I literally have to get a medical note every time I leave the country, and I have receipts showing I was traveling using UK public transport). I was beyond upset the School would do this, after they already prevented me from resiting level 2 during/after level 3… I trusted them and then I was left without resits and with additional late penalties because they wouldn’t enter me for resits in July and August.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I received the DVC outcome to my first appeal. It mentioned that Level 2 resits during/after Level 3 was not permitted within the University’s regulations. That was the only time the University communicated it to me. The DVC also blamed me for losing my last year of funding and being unable to receive resits, because I believed what HoS said was true. I also found out HoS found out what he told me wasn’t allowed the next day but instead of telling me, kept communicating as though it was allowed. The DVC also made up a random story about me being offered resits in July 2018 despite my making it clear I never was and the whole timeline not fitting in. 

&amp;nbsp;
 
I submitted my complaint to the OIA in early January 2019, while unwell. I received my DSAR in late January which was only when I found out I was granted mitigation all along (remember, I was told I couldn’t get mitigation and to appeal and ask for consideration)

&amp;nbsp;
 
I submit a complaint to the University while unwell.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I get a letter from Student Cases giving me less notice than they’re supposed to give for my second appeal hearing, but it’s either this or having to wait until October. I have the meeting over Skype, because of technical difficulties LUU didn’t get to be there, but it doesn’t matter because they just don’t listen to me anyway.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I get complaint outcome and I’m crying down the phone not understanding how I could be in a lecture and miss the register in every single one. Then I ask to see the registers, and I receive them all and I’m crying because I don’t understand how I could miss every single one. Then I ask other students and they tell me there was a register, but not while I was a student and multiple registers were handed out in the few lectures were there actually was a register.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I look at the registers the uni sent me again, and realise only some of them are dated. Specifically for the time I was a student. I realise the ones that are dated have ‘logged’ written on them in the same pen – the same person who dated them logged them into the University’s system.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I realise I missed one lecture on the 23rd. Another student remembers two registers being handed out on this date, which would have been for the 16th and 23rd which explains them two registers being in the same colour pen. I have concrete proof I attended those other lectures from audio recordings, fitbit tracking and uber receipts so there is NO WAY there was a register in a single lecture I attended.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I remember how HoS sent HoSC an email from my dissertation supervisor cut off specifically where he admitted that I did attend everything up until my withdrawal.  Just another case of the school omitting information to hide things and cover things up.

&amp;nbsp;
 
HoSC keeps telling me I’m going to get the complaint outcome the next week, and to call if I haven’t gotten it. I’m getting stressed because I cant make plans for my future an this whole thing is putting my life on hold. I’m getting stressed because my stuff is still in Leeds because I couldn’t afford a courier to send it back home until I got that complaint outcome and was reimbursed for wasted rent and wasting my time rescheduling holidays.
 
&amp;nbsp;

University basically lets the same biased DVC make a decision about my complaint and second appeal as the one who already blame me for being lied to and misled by the HoS.

I submit complaint to OIA. I receive all the minutes of the meetings, and if it wasn’t clear that the University didn’t base their judgement on what staff said before, it’s more than clear now. It’s just overwhelmingly disgusting how much staff have continued to lie and the amount of evidence showing them knowingly doing it, and that the Uni received evidence at the time of complaint which proved them to be lying… and yet here I am still being forced to go back through everything again and again.

I feel like when someone tells me something like this, I should be (and am), really alarmed. Are they getting help? Should I call the counseling center? Their advisor? 

I don't know what to do about the leniency issue. I remember being an undergrad and at least 50% of us were a total mess - sleep deprivation, junk-food diets, and social dramas left us all only barely functional and able to concentrate most of the time. Should I throw them a bone?

e5leyu,Asking_Questions2019,t2_3uq0ktkl,[Intro to Stats Retake/Enrichment vs 16 units challenge] Need advice about my last semester at CC before transfer to CSU," 

Context I: I am scheduled to transfer to a California State University via an associates for transfer psychology degree with an extra (not pursuing bachelors program) associates for transfer communication degree after the spring 2020 semester.

Context II: I was diagnosed and started treatment for ADHD during April of the Spring 2019 semester. Before treatment, I was basically barely understanding intro to stats and would have probably only passed due to grade inflation or by scrapping by with no real understanding.

Context III: After treatment started, I had a honeymoon period with Adderall where I was able to hyperfocus on Statistics and convert my low B to a low A. I was able to understand and thoroughly work on the rest of the stats chapters 8-13 (confidence intervals, hypothesis testings of various kinds, some ANOVA...). However, I failed a test and scrapped by the first test for chapters 1-7 of intro to stats. At this time I was technically taking just 10 units.

Context IV: Following my successful Spring 2019 semester, I mindlessly decided to take a six week online course for the summer for a class I dropped in the Spring. I got overwhelmed failed spectatcularly (20%) despite conferring with the instructor on a personal TMI level. During the Fall 2019 semester, I had initially tried to take 17 units worth with a pre-cal class that I did not need. I had to drop down to 12 units by dropping precal and I still struggled with my courses because I had focused too much on one course and apparently I still suck at coping with ADHD and being a good college student and adult.

**The Problem: I learned the hard way that being incompetent (or not up to standard of a course prereq wise) with prior material and skills in college level writing, study skills, and algebra in a course that needed those things was not a nice experience. At the state university level, I fear that I might pop into a class that uses stats and find that I really did not retain or grasp enough to make it through. I also have this fear with even the research methods course I am going to take at my CC.**

**I am contemplating taking intro to stats or remedial statistical literacy to enrich and compensate for my time I spent in SP19 Stats where I was un-medicated and did not do well or honest try on the earlier chapters. HOWEVER, doing so would move my credits from 12 units to 16 units. Looking at my courseload of 12 units, there are some reasons why it would be easier than this semester, but I am conflicted on whether or not potential stress and risks of taking 16 units is worth it in order to ready myself for applying statistics in my research methods course and for classes at the CSU.**

**My intro to stats instructor was surprised I did so well on the later and ""harder material"" but he did acknowledge I did not do too well on the earlier chapters. I do not know what to do and I would like some perspectives from those with more experience than me. I am not sure if I can even contact my stats instructor or future research method instructor because it is finals and then winter break....**

***Can/should I rise up to the challenge of 16 units to prevent my fear of being unprepared for CSU level application and learning of stats?***

***What kind of mindset should I have about this decision besides thinking that my future and mental health is in the balance?***",1,2019-12-03 18:35:24

I graduated from an interdisciplinary BA in Humanities and Social Sciences last year from a top tier university in my country. However, due to unfamiliarity with the concept of interdisciplinarity in my country and university in general, I did not manage to find internships during my period of study and am currently facing issues while job searching. I have been unable to find research organizations or professors to assist me writing research papers.

g6fm16,postdoc_throwaway3,t2_55qhqxvz,How to deal with a difficult grad student,"Throwaway for obvious reasons, but I need some advice!

I’m a postdoc in STEM doing a short stint in the lab I got my PhD in. Currently looking for jobs outside academia but given the current situation, I’m perfectly content finishing up some work in my stable work environment for the time being. I hope everyone is staying safe!

That being said, I’m in charge of a grad student. Normally, I love mentoring. It was one of my favorite parts of grad school. But this student is on another level, and while I think I’m fairly decent at empathizing with students and getting on their level to mentor them, this one is a black box to me.

This student has multiple mental issues - bipolar, anxiety, insomnia, multiple personality disorder, maybe even more. I admit, I have zero understanding of these things. I don’t have mental health issues, aside from maybe some mild anxiety. I can’t relate to them, and I try to understand that maybe some of their behavior isn’t their own doing. I can’t understand the way their brain works, and maybe that’s why I’m having a problem. 

This student comes across as lazy, arrogant, and apathetic to everything. They want everyone to do their work for them and get irrationally upset with constructive criticism (which is really all grad school is, isn’t it?). They don’t respond to anything, they don’t listen to any advice, and do what they want regardless of the consequences and how much it’s slowing down their progress. Lab work is not the place to reinvent the wheel, and this student acts like it’s their job to do it - and they do it poorly. 
This week we had zoom meetings that this student couldn’t be bothered to attend, which is baloney to me because we’re all working from from home with nothing else to do. All they had to do was turn their computer on and stare at a screen. There are no excuses, in my opinion. Not to mention, they were perfectly able to post on social media later on. This is not new - this student ALWAYS has excuses, and before this quarantine it was truly amazing if they were in lab for more than a few hours a day. I dunno about the rest of you, but when I was a grad student, I considered a 10 hour day a good day. 

That isn’t the point as much as I am at a total loss as to how to handle this student. Their schedule is my advisor’s job. But for me, I’m usually not mean, but this student brings out a side of me I hate, a mean side. A “why aren’t you doing your job” side. I’ve tried being nice, I’ve tried being mean, I’ve tried ignoring them entirely (abundance of talking for hours on end in lab is one of their abilities), and nothing works. Right now, I don’t know how this student is going to make it through the program. And I don’t know how much longer I can handle them.

I apologize for the long post, but I’m about at the end of the rope with them. Remote work has made it more difficult, as I’m afraid I’m better with words than I am in person, so working together has been tough, as this person still manages to make an excuse for everything. 
I need advice, and absolutely any wise words you may have in handling difficult students are SO welcome. 

Thanks for reading. Everyone stay safe out there!",1,2020-04-23 03:39:15

I am currently taking an MSc Forensic Psychology programme in the UK and, so far, haven't done very well with my assignments. My mental health (I have an ED) hasn't been great so far and this has played a role in my sub par grades (received two grades in the 50s and one in the 40s). I know I have already studied for half the year but in my heart, I believe I should change and do a research masters (mphil or mres) instead.  I graduated with an upper second class (1% of a first) with a first in my dissertation (I won two awards) so I have some confidence in my ability (as long as I keep my mental health in check).

Has anyone had any experience with this?

f1japv,marblemenow1,t2_14s0t7ve,Asking an Information Science Professor what it's like researching in academia,"To get to the main point of this point, I was wondering how I should address my interest in wanting to ultimately pursue research as a career and working in academia as a professor versus working in the industry as an industry researcher.

I've decided that I wanted to be a researcher as a career with research interests in data science, computational social science, natural language processing, machine learning, ethics, tech for social good, computational media, and accessibility in technology for disabled people just to name a few. 

I found out my research interests through research at Cornell University's Future of Learning Lab after my sophomore year in Summer 2019 and while I liked learning about education technology, I preferred to do more data science research in a broader context, specifically in computational social science at Cornell's Social Dynamics Lab, where I use natural language processing (e.g. topic modeling) to determine the emotional arcs of someone's suicidality before they attempt suicide, die by suicide, or get immediate intervention from either a hotline or emergency services, with Reddit data. 

I thoroughly enjoy computational sociology but I also want to branch out into digital humanities, specifically, analyze current events (e.g. Drug War in the Philippines, Spread of CoronaVirus, Martial Law of Macros) from a computational standpoint and make data visualizations based on the words that were most prevalent in news sources from different countries. For example, I would get local online news media like PhilStar and Inquirer for Filipino news and get reliable news sources for the American perspective on Filipino current events. 

As for accessibility in technology for disabled people, I am especially passionate about making technology more enjoyable for neurodiverse individuals, such as but not limiting to autistic folks and persons with ADHD. I want to make sure that autistic people who are non-speaking can still find effective ways to communicate without having to go through abusive therapy like ABA therapy (i.e. Please Google how autistic people who went through ABA therapy first-hand viewed it.) for example. I also want to make sure that people with ADHD don't feel like they have to rush when having to do timed tasks for job applications as well. I also want to conduct research on diversity in the tech industry and tech-related majors specifically for neurodiverse individuals and come up with effective ways to support them, which I will determine in the far future.

In terms of tech for social good, I want to use artificial intelligence and its subareas for social good, specifically in healthcare, mental health, civic tech, and government-related problems. I haven't thoroughly researched how I would use tech for positive social impact but I'll go into more detail later.",1,2020-02-10 02:08:09

dt2s3l,_scottwar,t2_qns2k,I think I've just failed my PhD,"This is kind of my open letter to academia...

My PhD was tough. It started really well, full UK scholarship, amazing project, and enthusiasm to do amazing research and follow the dream career. 

Then something happened. Can't pinpoint where or when, but my mental health deteriorated rapidly. I started to be afraid of going to the lab, and everything crumbled from there.

Two intermissions to try to sort my health, a referral at the first Viva and major corrections on my second and I have just submitted corrections..

I tried so hard to juggle the corrections with work, and I really doubt it was enough. 

I'm away from academia now, and even though I'm starting again I'm doing well in my new career. Still disappointed in myself though.

On the other hand, I've now done the final mic-drop on the (very personal) hell that became academia.

dvfpb0,ChodetteDickens,t2_3hjbozva,Applying for a PhD program at a very prestigious institution with a low GPA. Is it even worth a try?,"I have a very specific situation, and I really don't wish to disclose any of it to admissions (in the off chance someone suggests I allude to any of this in my personal statement. I want to preserve the little dignity I have left).

The situation is: When I started my undergrad, I had been in this country for a little over 3 years. I've always been quite stupid, and struggling with English on top of that didn't help my academic prospects. I went to community college (all I could afford) and eventually transferred to a four year institution within commutable distance from home (Couldn't afford to live on campus). I lived in a very abusive home and worked full time while getting my undergrad (also full time). 15-18 credit per semester (so I could finish fast and get out of that house) + 40 hour work week (so I could pay for college). I was exhausted, dealing with very severe OCD, and just overall struggling to keep up with life. 

Outside of work and class, I volunteered as a research assistant at a lab for a year and a teaching assistant for a class for a semester. I felt did what I could with that I had, but I was absolutely exhausted and my GPA suffered (US 3.5 or so). My mental health declined, I got kicked out of home, lived in my car for a little bit, then in one of my High School teachers' basement for a little bit, took the GRE, did very poorly in the math part (somehow managed to get an excellent verbal score), then quit my job, somehow was offered a higher paying job, applied to the few MS programs I could find that didn't require the GRE, got accepted into the two MS program I applied to, and ended up choosing the one out of state to get away from the abuse. Studied full time, worked part time, volunteered as an RA at a lab part time (lab which eventually gave me a paid position), tried committing suicide a couple times, and finished my MS with an even worse GPA than my Bachelors (albeit with a publication in the works).

After that, I spent the next couple years working in research in my field, and have acquired a lot of research experience and co-authored about 6 or so publications (along with a few more conference posters, etc) relevant to my field. Took the GRE again and did poorly in math again, applied to PhD programs and was rejected, got more research experience, attempted suicide again, first authored a small publication, went to a psychologist who thinks I'm in the autism spectrum, co-authored a poster that was presented at an important conference in my field, then decided to give this PhD application thing another try this year.

Contacted an amazing academic in my field whose work I have admired for years, talked to them, sent them my CV and a few of my research ideas, and they feel like I am a perfect fit for their lab and would be happy to support my application. They explained that (as expected) their support does not guarantee admission, as spots are very competitive. That said, they feel my application is very competitive based on my experience, ideas, and fit. BUT THERE'S ONE THING: They haven't seen my transcripts, and I don't feel like they have any idea how bad they are. I feel like this will just end as a pointless reminder of how much of a failure I am, and that I have no chance of ever even having a shot at getting accepted into a PhD program no matter how much passion I have for this field, no matter how much of a good fit I am for the program, how much experience in the field I have, how many publications I have, etc.

Should I even apply?",1,2019-11-12 20:22:45

I see in the rules that 'tedious whining about grad school burnout' isn't allowed, but I really need advice on this, or at least a big kick up the arse. 

I am in a PhD program at a highly ranked program in my field. I am fully funded. My field is in the Humanities and not one in which I have many career options if I were to quit now (i.e. not Economics or Psychology or anything remotely useful); I would probably have to go into the pre-tertiary teaching profession in some form or another, which I feel contains the precise elements of academia that I'm trying to get away from. 

I applied for grad school during a very horrible part in my life. My personal life was a mess, and I was dealing with severe mental health issues. I really did not think my decision through properly. At the end of the day, I blundered into this position, but now I am not sure what to do.

Why do I dislike my program? I struggle with the meaning of it all. Why are we answering these niggling, minuscule, frankly useless questions? I struggle with the social isolation of being in a competitive department. I know I should check under my own soles for shit and all that, but the truth is I don't get along with any of the students here. I've tried to make friends outside the department, but I feel like everyone here is too busy or too hostile (this is a really competitive campus). I struggle with the feeling that I am researching things which make other people (my supervisors) happy instead of what I really like. But at the end of the day, frankly, I know that these are just excuses. The truth is that if I wanted to, if I knew what to do, I would be able to take some initiative and find some niche for myself in the discipline and in the department. However, I can't seem to think of anything and I just spend all my time mechanically doing my homework and my readings and working out - I'm a caricature of a well-functioning human being. 

Why am I still here? Academically, I'm doing fine, and the faculty and I get along well. I'm not sure what I would do if I were to quit. I would have to leave the country, since I am a foreigner, and my home country is one where opportunities for people in my specific discipline are even thinner on the ground than they are here. I don't have any careers lined up and I have no money to live on while I sort things out. 

Outwardly, I'm your normal first-year graduate student. I might even seem happy, or well-adjusted, or intelligent. But every day is a slog. I have a psychiatrist and I'm taking concrete steps to function (the aforementioned exercise, healthy eating, medication, sleep, etc) but I'm not sure what more I can do. 

What do I want to do? I don't know, and I know I sound like the world's biggest asshole, but I am just frankly rather overwhelmed by everything, and I am truly desperate for some way to discern what to do here. So I'm asking if anyone had a similar experience in their first term of graduate school, and if this feeling did somehow go away, or if you were able to take any concrete steps to make it go away. I wish this post were more articulate, but it's the best I can do - my wires feel all jumbled. Please help!",1,2019-11-13 02:59:15

In that time I've got one first author publication (related to my PhD, not my postdoc), one mid-author, and two pre-prints, one of which won't be moving forward. There are three manuscripts that could get submitted this year but submitted isn't published and really I feel completely demoralized by the gaps on my CV. 

The lab (4-6 members) had a rough year with a graduate student who was dealing with a mental illness eventually resulting in a psychotic break and left the lab. It was honestly somewhat traumatic because we all did everything in our power to get this student help but it did nothing. 

My boss is surly and difficult to work with. I'm pretty placid and used to ornery bosses, and I was given a lot of flexibility/leeway as a new mom (I had a baby in my second year) and a husband with a well-managed but chronic health condition, so it was working well for a while but I'm realizing now how much I am being taken advantage of. I work really hard, but have so very little to show for it. I don't know how to apply for grants. My boss keeps telling me I won't get one. I don't know if I should spend my energy in a futile effort applying for grants or futile effort in getting these papers out. I'm so disillusioned with the system. I can't even tell if I like research anymore. I used to enjoy it. I can't remember what I enjoy about it. 

I taught a semester as an adjunct. I always was interested in teaching and thought I would enjoy it because I like working with undergrads and I had enjoyed TAing as a grad student, but I found it challenging and got some pretty harsh evals (I was very pregnant at the time, which didn't help). When I left I remember thinking that I could have done it better but overall it was a good experience. However, looking back I just remember being tired, stressed, and feeling hated by my students.

My advisor is a great guy, and also very well-connected -- he has multiple close collaborations with industry and other research labs, which has meant that as his student, if you want to spend a summer somewhere else, you basically just e-mail him about it and you're good to go.  Thanks to him, I've built up a really nice CV with stints at various research organizations around the world.  

My advisor and I got closer after his two most productive students defended and left, and it was clear that he was disappointed that they didn't try to get research jobs, ""only"" applied (but super lucrative) roles in the bay area.  I was spinning my wheels for a few years, not doing anything particularly productive, and then we basically started doing a lot of really interesting work in this sub-area that interested both of us, and now I have multiple top publications, a ""better"" publication record than many of his students who have graduated. 

He's convinced that I can make it in academia, and has joked a few times about how ""in 1-2 years, we'll have over 10 top pubs easily if we keep going at this rate"".  Thanks to an internship at another lab, I have helped him forge a close collaboration with another research group, which has led to some of the more junior students also interning there, and multiple active projects where I am the ""bridge"" between all parties.  In some ways he treats me more as a post doc or even junior faculty, and he's asked me to basically advise multiple junior students.  This all sounds great, right?  The problem is...**I no longer have any interest in academia or research.**

This high level of productivity the past ~2 years has seriously impacted my health (mostly mental health) and my loved ones, and even as I've talked to him about ""slowing down the pace a bit"" and maybe not intensively working on something at 10pm on a Saturday over Slack, I'm constantly looking at jobs listings.  My friends who have only a BS (a few an MS) have incredible jobs and at this stage in their lives have built decent wealth, some of them are buying houses, meanwhile I am still a broke student with only a few nice papers to show for it. 

I'm coming towards the end of my 4th year with this semester, but I feel like there's no way I can put in another two.  In my area/with my advisor the dissertation is basically ""staple some publications and submitted papers together"", and though he claims not to have a hard rule about number of pubs, just looking at the students that have graduated, I have more pubs than all but one (the dude who spent 7 years).  So ""research contribution""-wise I feel like I'm ready to finish sometime year 5.

I know the advisor has 100% discretion in when their students graduate, but I've been afraid to bring up these concerns for a bunch of reasons -- not wanting to actually get in the mindset of hunting for a job after years of ""guaranteed-employment"" academia, knowing how much he relies on me right now and maybe not wanting to hear the answer (he's a demanding advisor, but as far as I know not the kind of person to needlessly exploit his students.  Another guy who started the same time as me and is frankly lazy af has done basically no research but the advisor lets him coast).

Does anyone have experience in mastering out? I feel like my mental health is really suffering during my PhD (I am a first year) and I don’t see the point continuing for another 4+ years.

I’m fully funded and have a decent advisor, but I just can’t take the stress of disappointing my advisor by not doing my best. I really dislike my research project and just want to work at Walmart 9-5 or deliver pizzas since at least I’d know what to do each day. 

I gotta get out for my well-being. I’m just afraid of disappointing my advisor and regretting my decision years from now. I don’t feel like the PhD is worth since job academic prospects are terrible and the PhD doesn’t play on my strengths (I love working with people but I’m so isolated right now and I’m not sure this would even improve much post-Covid). But I also feel like I’m throwing away an awesome opportunity I’ve been given.

I’m so lost and struggling internally everyday. Any thoughts?

lj8c2n,daldrys,t2_r6ivf,Is it normal that the PI regularly shout and blame?,"Hi,
I work as a postdoc within one of the top UK universities in my field, we work in a fast paced environment with a lot of industry pressure. I joined about a year ago. To my surprise the line manager was a very different person from the interview. He's very straightforward with his comment, if he thinks something is rubbish he tells you in cruid way even in front of other members of the group.
He is never satisfied about anything and if something isn't exactly how he wanted you to do he gets frustrated.

Last Friday, after he calls in for a meeting out of nowhere, there was some misunderstanding about how to approach a certain task but he quickly went into a meltdown and started shouting and putting blame on me  that I'm not doing enough and running the project correctly and so on.

He's like that with most of the other postdocs especially the newer ones, and this postdoc turned out to be a living hell for me, it affects me a lot when he does that, which i feel it's limit bullying, and makes my imposter syndrome even more harmful to my mental health. Some would say just quit but as a migrants the visa is related to this job and it's hard so far to get a new job even after two interviews.

I want to ask about what people's views on how he reacts and if it is acceptable or should I complain? 

Just as a side note last time even him thought he went to far and apologized for a first time, saying he ""needs a nap"" and ""it was a long day"".

I am immensely interested in researching mental health/developmental disorders, as well as malignant brain development due to environmental stressors/trauma within marginalized communities. I have more specific research interests that I expressed in my personal statement as well, that I believe aligned with advisors I wanted to work with. I didn't apply to that many because I couldn't afford it and didn't qualify for the income waiver either that typically requires below poverty level indication. 

I've been trying to find full-time research positions since I graduated in 2019 with a B.A. in Psychology from a small university and I have been applying to a variety of full-time research assistant/coordinator/manager positions (*all around the U.S.*) since I graduated and have only gotten rejections and no interviews, even for positions I was clearly qualified for. The people that I've known to get these type of positions always have had some kind of connection from the inside to get in, which I do not. I ended up taking a full-time management job in the private sector, whilst volunteering in a research lab part time (*this lab does not have any full time positions*).

I feel very stuck and discouraged especially as a BIPOC person, it seems like gatekeeping runs very deep in academia and full-time research/PhD opportunities for Psychology and Neuroscience are incredibly slim. 

Any advice on the next steps I should take to increase my chances of getting into a PhD next cycle? I would also be open to applying to Cog Neuro Phd programs as well.

I hear so many graduate school horror stories and I feel like those are the majority. Are there people who enjoyed their PhD experience? Had a good work life balance ? Did not overwork themselves to exhaustion? Took most weekends off ? Had good, supportive PIs ? 

I started a PhD in 2014 but quit after 2 years and left with my masters because of mental health problems. I’ve been working in industry/ government since then, and I love it but I realized that my true passion is research and I am happiest doing experiments, and want to get back to grad school and apply to PhD programs. I sorely miss being in the lab doing experiments. I’ll be quite a bit older (30-31 when I start) but I’m not too concerned about that, in fact I think my experiences and perspective will help. My scientific skills are better than they were too so I feel ready. However, I’m concerned about the transition to life back in academia, in terms of the lifestyle. Also long term, I’m more inclined to an academic career although most don’t recommend it - I have an open mind for sure but I’ve realised in the 4 years of working in industry that it’s not my thing. 
I’m in USA and my field is biophysics/biochemistry. Many of my friends in Europe enjoyed their PhD experience but I know it’s different in USA. 
I’d love to hear about some good experiences! 

TLDR: looking to go back to get my PhD after 4 years in industry, want to hear about positive PhD experiences.",1,2021-02-19 23:16:34

I am a current senior at a U.S. institution studying psychology and am currently in the process of applying to post-baccalaureate research assistant positions prior to applying to Clinical Psychology PhD programs in the USA. I have had the privilege of being offered three different positions at three different institutions, and I am having trouble deciding which one to accept and which one will give me the best chances of in getting into a graduate program. I have been wracking my brain for a week deciding which to go with and I need to come up with a decision soon, so please, any help would be much appreciated!!!

Here is some info on my interests and what each of the three opportunities are (dm me if you want specifics)-

**My interests and background**: (*Experience*) I have practical experience working with children on the spectrum and other neurodevelopmental disorders; research coordinator and research assistant at a university lab studying socioemotional development, parenting, and peer relationships; also a research assistant pediatric hospital working a studies on mental health care access and mental health disparities

(*Interests*) In the future, I want to study mental health disparities in diagnosis and intervention in child and adolescent populations; I have an interest in specifically studying childhood externalizing disorders and transdiagnostic outcomes of neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. social impairments, behavioral problems); want develop interventions and assessments that can be used to address socio-emotional concerns for neurodiverse children in school settings

Job 1 - An IRTA position at the NIMH

Job 2 - Clinical research coordinator at a pediatric hospital

Job 3 - Faculty research assistant at an R1 university

I want to ask the academic community: what would be most important to consider when choosing a post-baccalaureate experience in preparation for applying to PhD (more specifically, clinical psychology PhD) programs. Does prestige (ie. NIH) matter more than research fit, does research productivity in the post-bac matter most, etc.?

m0mywt,possiblegirl,t2_kn4vg,Entry-level non-academic research/writing/education jobs for humanities PhDs with little experience outside academia: do they exist? how should I go about looking for them? what can I do to make myself a more competitive candidate?,"I'm in the final year of a historical musicology PhD at an elite university in the U.S. and am currently looking for jobs. Although I haven't ruled out staying in academia and have applied to some academic jobs that are good fits for me, I am not counting on this and am actively trying to find options in the non-academic market. I've gotten the ""a PhD gives you so many transferable skills!"" and ""you don't have to have all the qualifications to apply for a job!"" spiels many times, and I agree that there are a lot of jobs that I could be great in. But when I actually look at jobs, I feel keenly aware that most of them are looking for candidates who have a lot more directly relevant experience than I do; and so far, despite working with a career counselor and putting a lot of effort into crafting resumes and cover letters that emphasize my transferable skills, I haven't made it to the interview stage of anything I've applied for.

The main sectors I've been looking at/applying in are:

* Research/consulting/analyst jobs at jobs in the education, arts, mental health, and outdoors sectors. (The first two are relevant to my PhD work; the second two are things I'm personally passionate about.)
* Freelance writing and editing jobs
* Academic advising/coaching/counseling jobs (at both university and K-12 levels)
* Teaching at private K-12 schools

The transferable skills I think I can emphasize from my PhD work are:

* Gathering and synthesizing complex information from a variety of sources (dissertation)
* Communicating complex ideas in a clear and compelling way (dissertation/teaching)
* Giving clear and engaging oral presentations (conference presentations/teaching)
* Planning and executing events within a budget for diverse attendees (conference planning, service work at the departmental and graduate school level)
* Writing successful grant applications (research/service work)
* Experience with academic writing/publishing/proofreading 
* Training in critical pedagogy, student assessment, and assignment design; demonstrated record of successful teaching (high student evaluation ratings)
* Mentorship and training experience (training new teaching assistants; working with undergraduates  developing senior thesis projects)
* Relationship-building experience (service work involving collaborations with on- and off-campus organizations)
* Experience independently managing multiple short- and long-term priorities and completing tasks autonomously without external supervision

I also have K-12 experience as a private tutor (full time 2010-2012) and management experience as the manager of a work-exchange program at a yoga studio (part-time 2017-2020).

Areas I don't have (much) experience in that I often see on job postings:

* Quantitative research experience. (I did well in college math/statistics and am confident I could learn this, but I don't have any existing experience with it)
* Experience with social-scientific qualitative research/interviews/surveys. (I've done this for some grad seminar projects, but not for my dissertation work.)
* Portfolio of non-academic published writing. (The closest I have area few public musicology blog posts and CD liner notes written more than 5 years ago. I have some personal writing projects I'd like to work on, so perhaps building a portfolio could be an achievable medium-term goal.)
* SEO optimization knowledge/experience. (Considering taking an online course on this, but not sure how much it would help me without demonstrated experience implementing SEO.)
* Project management experience. (Some of my service work kind of fits this...)
* X years of experience in the relevant career sector....

In the longer term, I could imagine pursuing further education/unpaid volunteer or freelance work/etc to build experience in these areas, but right now I really just need a job. I'm sure the market is especially bad now, but I just don't see many genuinely entry-level positions. I have been trying networking (including writing cold emails to people at organizations I'd be interested in working with); so far I haven't had a lot of luck with that, either, but maybe I just need to keep trying.

If anyone has experience making this transition with a similar set of skills/experience, I'd love to hear about your experience and anything you found helpful. I know it's an incredibly tough market for everyone right now, but I wish I didn't feel so much like I'm wasting my time pouring hours into applying for jobs that realistically I have very low odds of getting.

I have been doing a PhD in the UK for 4 years. I just finished my data collection.

I made a stupid mistake in my lab data, for 1 of my 3 samples I used a slightly different piece of equipment to treat samples. It doesn't invalidate the data but it makes the write up difficult and other than '""I fucked up and now this sample is a bit different and it might have changed the results"" I don't know how to explain it.

Worse yet, this happened a few months ago mid-pandemic and I was so scared of running out of time to complete the work that I didn't tell my supervisors and risk having to repeat. I'm having that conversation this week.

So my question to r/askacademia is: How shitty was/is your PhD data? How dodgy can it be while still getting through the viva? Is there a minimum amount to submit and still be ok?

jlnde4,InductiveLeapfrog,t2_5ug0c82n,Is wanting to postpone a PhD because of the Pandemic proof I shouldn't do it in the first place?,"Thanks for reading! I'd be super grateful on some perspective how my situation sounds to you.

I just finished my Master's and love my research topic. I have a PhD proposal almost ready to submit, a supervisor I like and enjoyed working with before, and the support of other researchers at the same university. Due to my recent Master thesis, I'm even in personal contact with some of the other researchers in the field - partially people I've admired for years. I've worked towards and dreamt of being in this position for a really, really long time (ca 40% of my life so far) - but now,  I feel like I'd be doomed to fail and dissappoint everyone involved if I submitted my PhD proposal and started a PhD now. 

I was recently diagnosed with autism and ADHD, and the past few months have shown me how much I struggle organising different projects at once, without clear deadlines and while working from home. I would be devastated if this continued and led to me having to do a 180 further down the application process where even more people count on me, or worse, my poor organisation skills would lead to me fail a PhD and disappointing the people I look up to. 
I also find online communication  quite difficult - there's rarely any feedback how an email is perceived by the recipient and zoom calls are not that much better. And there's no 'running into people' to quickly chat over or ask for advice on pragmatic/social stuff as in ""so what did X mean when..."". 
And of course, my research area isn't corona-relevant and funding will likely become very sparse pretty soon, test subjects aren't even available during Covid. Given my autistic need for predictability, there's a chance I would spend my PhD time worrying over getting a postdoc position instead of enjoying the privilege of doing the PhD itself. 

There's a good alternative for me - I am rather fortunate to have an opportunity to use the next 3-4 years just learning research methodology (which would guarantee a ""backup"" plan outside academia and allow me to enjoy a PhD without future-worries), getting therapy, taking ADHD self-structuring programs and doing internships in-between. (I know how privileged I am here - sorry if I seem ungrateful).  So, I told my supervisor I would be putting off my PhD application for now so I can spend the Pandemic close to my family and postpone this to a time past corona where I would get more out of the PhD experience itself.
Rationally, I know it's the right choice - I'd have time to learn how to write and prepare myself for a PhD, get therapy and ADHD-self-organisation support, perhaps see if my ADHD can get medicated better and so on.

At the same time, it's heartbreaking seeing this dream sail away when I got so close to reaching it. I know it's objectively the best thing for me and my mental health right now - but I come across all these inspirational quotes a la ""do the thing before you're ready"" and ""don't be the coward taking the safe path"" and it makes we want to puke and scream out of fear I just majorly messed up and ruined my chances of studying the thing I've been fantasizing researching since high school. I worry whether my supervisor thinks that if I feel working from home is reason enough to not pursue this PhD opportunity now, when I have written the entire proposal and was always quite vocal about my hope to do a PhD and was even offered support for the grant application process, then I'm unreliable, flaky, and don't have what it takes to be in academia anyway.

First of all, in relevance to the title: I know why I didn't get the letter. Throughout the last year of my masters, I've been struggling a lot with mental and physical health problems, along with problems with my mother's health that has made it difficult for me to be motivated and enthusiastic about research. I have completed subpar work in the last year of the work that I've done for this PI (which has been about 3 years) but I know he has high expectations and at this point I know he doesn't expect much of me because I've been struggling with meeting deadlines and working at the level he wants me to. I can admit that and I don't mind that he won't write me a letter - I kind of expected it. It hurts, sure, but I'm going to work through what I can until I graduate and defend next year. 

My question is: how does this affect my future prospects? This PI was my undergraduate and graduate mentor. I want to still be able to complete a PhD, and while I have two other letters (both from summer programs) I won't have it from him. I feel like that would honestly very bad on applications. 

Because of financial reasons (re: my mom's illness) I most likely won't be able to apply for graduate school this cycle anyway, although I originally planned to. I've shifted my focus to looking for R&amp;D positions and research associate jobs in my area. I hope to work in an industry lab for a while and maybe apply again in a couple years. However, I wanted to know: if I don't include a letter of rec from this PI, how bad would it look on grad school apps? Even in the future? I most likely won't ask him again and he most likely won't offer to write me one in the future. I would just like to know what to expect and other people's perspectives on this.

I had a very negative experience with my advisor, which was underlain by a lot of incompetence by my advisor and indifference/dysfunction in my department. The overall dysfunction got so bad that the dean of research for my university disallowed my advisor from advising any other PhD student, and moreover the department was warned it would be dissolved if it couldn't get its act together.

Tomorrow I have a meeting with a fairly influential professor in another department who is interested in me possibly working with him in future projects. I've managed to answer and deflect questions about my advisor over email, but I'm worried about in depth questions over our video call. I'd like to be able to answer diplomatically and neutrally, rather than sound like I'm shit-talking my former department. 

Does anyone have good strategies for answering questions neutrally about these kinds of bad experiences? I would also like to avoid any future collaboration with my advisor, so if anyone has any input about how to say they'd rather not work with someone, that would be really helpful.

(Just for a bit of context, I'm not just trying to be precious about this.

l3r566,bp1academicthrowaway,t2_9ynmbqp6,Successful Academic Career with Bipolar type 1?,"Tl;Dr: have you or anyone you known successful completed a STEM Ph.D. and continued in academia with type 1 Bipolar Disorder?

I am a prospective Ph.D. student in STEM in the US (anxiously checking my email these days!!) I've had mental health issues forever, mostly depressive, but I managed it alright in undergrad. I have a strong history of bipolar disorder in my family and we always suspected I had it, and sure enough I had my first manic episode in the last couple months.

I've stabilized and have a good support system, therapist, treatment plan, and everything, but just thinking of the way I hear grad students talk about the stress of grad school...its got me terrified that I just won't be able to do it and take care of myself. The two biggest triggers for a mood episode with BP1 are stress and sleep disruption.

I'm a first generation college student so the idea of getting a Ph.D. in the first place is already buckwild, but now knowing how carefully I have to manage my stress, and knowing the challenges of the disorder, it would be nice to hear about anyone else who has faced this.

Have you or someone you know succeeded in grad school and academia with BP1? Would you have any advice for someone else in that situation?",1,2021-01-24 03:07:48
kxk965,DystopianAnomaly,t2_13j6f2,My PI makes us present our research every 2-3 weeks. I am bipolar and the stress makes my mood cycle and I end up suicidal. How do I ask for accommodations?,"This is a bit of a long post so bear with me.


I am a second year PhD student in STEM, but I already mastered out of another PhD after my advisor left (at the same institution) and had to transfer departments, so technically this is my fourth year at this university. I am on my third advisor at the moment (first advisor of my PhD) and have been in the group since I started my PhD 1.5 years ago.


I was happy for the first year in the group, I didn't have to present my research updates and I learned a ton. The PI is neither too hands on nor too hands off, which is a sweet spot for me. All was going great. After my first year, I had to join the presentation schedule. Three people have to present weekly, for 30-60 minutes each, and each person has to present every 2-3 weeks. Everyone hates having to present and it's stressful for everyone in the group, but I thought I could handle it if everyone else can. And I was wrong.


The presentations, combined with COVID, made my mental health rapidly deteriorate and I was ultimately diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, which I've apparently had since my late teen years but was doing well for ~2 years before COVID. I just couldn't handle the stress of having to produce new results and present them in such a time frame.


A big part of managing bipolar disorder is charting your moods, and I can now pretty much predict my depressive and hypomanic episodes based on when I'll be presenting. My depressive episodes are severe, and I get very suicidal. I have considered getting myself voluntarily committed multiple times just to get a break from the stress of the presentations and keep myself safe from my suicidal ideation. I just can't handle it. I barely function when depressed and cannot work and end up presenting total crap for 15-20 minutes. My hypomanic episodes are ""great"" in the sense that I work 12 hours a day and produce a ton of results, but I'm medicated now that I know I'm bipolar and I refuse to do this to myself.


I will be registered with the disabled students office very soon which entitles me to some accommodations under the ADA, and presumably I could ask to present less frequently and have fewer simultaneous projects (another issue in this group). How do I ask my advisor for these accommodations without making things awkward? Everyone else hates group meeting but can handle it, and he has refused multiple times to stretch out the time between individual presentations. I don't want my colleagues to hate me for getting special treatment. It's only a few of us and everyone would know I'm disabled when the word gets out that I present on a ""special"" schedule (one of the students has to set up the schedule, not the PI).


I really don't know what to do but I can't leave the group, I don't want to be that guy who never settles on an advisor and I don't know if I can find an opening in my small field. I also NEED to maintain a good relationship with my advisor because of how famous he is if I'd like a future in this field (I also like the guy, despite everything).


Any thoughts? Advice?


tl;dr: I'm bipolar, advisor has us present our research every 2-3 weeks, I can't handle the pressure and my mood cycles. Can presumably ask for a ""special"" schedule under ADA but don't know how to do it without everyone noticing I'm disabled or things getting awkward because I’m getting special treatment.",1,2021-01-15 01:50:23
kve02d,ConfusedPhDLemur,t2_9rxghbk3,"I am thinking of either changing my PhD project, or returning back home, getting a job and doing a PhD besides it, but I don’t know what to do","Hi all. Sorry for the long post, but I am looking for your advice and opinion. For obvious reasons, I will use a throwaway account.

Currently, I am about four months into my PhD and I am having problems with the topic and the general area of my PhD.

**A little background:**

* My background is a masters in Financial Mathematics with a focus on statistics and probability modelling from a low ranked EU uni in my home country (but the best in my country), but with comparable education to the best EU unis, based on my experience from my exchange year
* The university I am currently at is one of the top EU universities, but it is quite a long distance away from my home country and my girlfriend, family and friends
* The PhD is in a specific topic in operations research (OR)
* I am fully funded (little above the mean wage for the country) from a specific project with quite a narrowly defined topic
* After finishing my PhD, I would like to go and work in the industry (consulting, insurance, (central) banking etc.). Basically, I want to be doing research and development in a private institution, and then progressing in a more managerial role later

As a preface, I love doing research. I loved doing it for my master's thesis and in my student jobs. So this is the reason why I want to do a PhD. Because I think that if I found a topic that would interest me, I could give it my all.

**The problem:**

When I have applied to the program/project, the description was very interesting to me, as it combined my knowledge and interest of probability with a practical area in OR (process scheduling). During the interviews, the project was described to me in some more detail, but it still seemed that it was suitable for me.

But when I accepted and signed the offer and arrived at the university, I got to read the project proposal in full. And what I found was that the project was mostly OR, with probability as a distant afterthought. Also, the more we discuss the direction of the project, the more I get the feeling that my strengths, which were the reason they accepted me, lie in the opposite direction.

I am now having problems working on this topic because even though I try to approach it enthusiastically, my enthusiasm is short-lived. I cannot bring myself to get immersed in it, unlike with my master's thesis, where I loved reading the articles, finding new things and researching them further.

I found out that my interests lie in data and models construction based on that data. Additionally, I found out that, despite my previous thinking, I much more prefer stochastics and statistics, especially combined with finance, than OR. I also think that if I had a topic in these areas, not only would it be easier for me to work on it, I could contribute so much more than I can here.

So now I don’t know what to do. It's not like I don’t want to do a PhD, I do, I just don’t see myself going forward like this. I know it might pass, and everyone is telling me to hang in there, and that it will get better. But it really doesn’t feel like this. I am also worried about not getting a job after my PhD if I persist. This feels especially bad, as I was in high demand before leaving my country. Because of all of my doubts and fears, my mental health isn’t the best, as I am constantly anxious, can’t concentrate and do anything. Additionally, the current Covid situation and physical social isolation aren’t doing me any good either.

If I wasn’t paid from the project, I would have tried to change the field. There are currently two projects opened at the same university, with detailed descriptions which suit my interests perfectly. If they were available when I was applying the first time, I would definitely apply to them first.

**The reason why I feel particularly bad about the whole thing:**

Before I decided to go to my current university, I had several options. I had a guaranteed job in my preferred industry with the possibility of doing my PhD alongside it (which would be quite manageable because of the job’s nature). I also had a PhD offer in the same field, which was funded, but I would earn much less (partly because of the country, partly because of the fact that PhD scholarships are ridiculously low in my country). The reason why I didn’t accept them was that they were at my home university, which, as mentioned, has low rankings. The PhD I would have done there could have been shaped by my interests and would be directly beneficial to the field in the industry I want to go to, unlike the current one.

**My question:**

What would you good people suggest me to do?

1. Try to endure for a few more months and see if the topic grows on me, but forfeiting the opportunity to try and apply to two very suitable projects?
2. Leave the PhD, return to my home country, get a job there in data science or credit risk modelling, and start with the PhD next year. But in this case, I am a PhD dropout, who will get his PhD one year later from a relatively unknown uni.
3. Try to switch the promotors and the project? Besides the funding, I don’t know how this would work, as I am afraid that even suggesting this would cause bad blood between me and all of the involved parties, and that it will ultimately be unsuccessful. If this is the best option, how would one go about this?

In the end, the thing I am additionally scared about is the prospect of not getting a job abroad (still in the EU) if I change the program or uni, as I would either be someone who didn’t commit to a specific topic or someone who has the relevant industry experience and a PhD, but both from a small country in the EU. Granted my PhD would be in STEM, but still.

I guess that my situation is quite specific, but if anybody has any advice or a similar experience, I would be grateful.

**TL;DR:** The topic of my PhD is different than imagined, I have no idea whether to change the promotors and my project, return to my country and do a PhD there or just persevere.

**Ps.** I have to add that both of my promotors are extremely nice, especially one I somewhat knew from before, so there are no real hard feelings from my side about our “misunderstanding“ about the topic.",1,2021-01-11 22:36:57
kvfag1,twosteponetwo,t2_89615x5c,Any psychology (or related field) academics interested in participating in a student organized conference?,"[I’m sorry in advance if this post is not allowed] 

Hi everyone, I’m writing on behalf of a student group from Croatia that is organizing their 2nd psychology conference. 

I’m wondering if there are any academics interested in participating in our conference. This year we are doing it over zoom and we wanted to include a wide variety of people from different countries. 

The conference basically consists of academics and professionals in the field talking about their interests to students of the university. They talk (for about 40 minutes to an hour) about their research, their work experiences or their general interests and usually theres a good turnout because the lectures provide a different not-so-dry perspective on various subjects. This year we did some research about the interests of our audience and I’ll leave them down below but everyone is pretty much welcome. 

Interests: 
- Social psychology 
- Organizational psychology 
- Clinical psychology (main interests are mental illnesses, psychotherapy, work experiences, relationship between a therapist and client, how to take care of your mental health)
- Forensic psychology (main interest abuse, work experiences) 
- Psychology of personality (mainly interests in the dark tetrad and personality theories) 

The conference will be held at the end of February (19th and 20th) and if anyone is interested (or knows someone who might be) please leave a comment!",1,2021-01-11 23:43:03
kvj9pc,neur0logics,t2_2miy4fxz,Poster submission extension for virtual conference,"I am presenting two posters as a student at an upcoming virtual conference.

I was talking to another student and they mentioned that getting an extension for submitting their presentation material at another virtual conference was no big deal, they just had to ask.

kx4wi3,Walk_on_walls,t2_8ltglu3f,I feel completely lost as a senior Researcher / Postdoc.,"Bit of a long post, thanks if you read it all the way through. 

I’m just over the 3-year mark with my postdoc and I feel quite anxious and lost as to what to do next. A bit of a backstory; I finished my PhD in 2017 in molecular microbiology, it was really tough, but I learned a lot and I had great supervisors. I wanted a change of scenery so I moved to Sweden where I would start on a project in more or the less the same field and I knew I would be a great candidate, so I applied. 

After receiving the offer and moving, it became apparent that my new group not only didn’t have any special lab infrastructure prepared but expected me to figure it out on my own. Contrary to what was alluded to in the interview. I was the first person on the project and in comparison, to my PhD workspace, it was completely barren. On the upside, we had plenty of money so it would be financially possible to get the lab fully kitted out, safe and easy to work in as there would be students and other researchers later. 

My initial doubts set in after a month as it was clear that the young guy who was leading the project, was completely hopeless. He had no background knowledge in my field, no real idea of lab setup and no realistic vision or project goals. I don’t mind people not knowing, but when its real moronic ignorance paired with arrogance, I started to get annoyed. I wonder how he got the grant for this work and what sort of bullshit he wrote. I also couldn’t just pack up and leave as I had people dependant on me, and it would mean another difficult move and transition. 

As time went on, it was clear the project wasn’t progressing well. The arrogant moron quit after 7 months and left no plan. So, I got a new project manager who was also completely ignorant to my field but made a substantially greater effort to learn. I did make some good progress in terms of lab building, I designed and created a space with a lot of expensive equipment and safety systems, all on my own. This was great experience, except you can’t publish this sort of work. My new project manager turned out to be totally unsympathetic to the nature of my work and frequently belittled me in front of people and was extremely rude. I got depressed but I pushed on because my lab was basically finished. 

As the month’s past, my mental health deteriorated, and I was always irritable and anxious which affected my personal life. I finally snapped when I couldn’t take any more shit from my new project manager and confronted her. This worked, and she toned down a lot. However, at this point I was already feeling burned out and I noticed that I was constantly on the lookout for new jobs. 

Other bad things included having several of my project ideas either stolen from me or not given acknowledgment. I felt trapped because I had on-going projects that I wanted to publish, and publications equate to your worth in the shitty world of academia. In addition, the contract policy here is very stupid. You start with a small year contract, which “might” be extended by another year or 4-6 months, who knows, so you’re in a constant state of uncertainty. This also messes up an prospects of buying a house and settling down – I haven’t bothered learning Swedish as I always thought I’d leave. 

As of now, my partner of 5 years and I have separated for other reasons, but I think the stress and certainty from work contributed towards that. I feel freer to just quit this place and search for work elsewhere, and I am desperate to leave academia for good. The problem is that I feel I might have overspecialised in my area – and that finding the right place will be a nightmare. I have about 11 months left on my contract, but I am almost tempted to quit tomorrow. I have had enough of academic life, chasing stupid publications, pleasing ungrateful, idiotic bosses and constantly worrying where I’m going to live next. 

I just want to know if anyone else has had similar experiences – or is going through something similar?",1,2021-01-14 12:41:34
eoogqf,fakehumanitarianhoe,t2_4xam489u,How do you narrow down your research focus on understudied subjects to produce original work?,"Hey everyone! I know this is mostly a subreddit for postgraduate work, but I'm an undergraduate International Development student, currently working on my dissertation. It's due in April, so I do still have time, but I've been struggling since September to really figure out what my focus is. Due to the nature of my degree, we don't do any of our own first-hand research in the field, so my dissertation has to be secondary literature, unless I devise my own frameworks.

My topic generally is mental health and migration, with a focus on Chinese internal migration, which is regretfully a really understudied topic. I'm super passionate about global health, migration and China studies, although I'm increasingly regretting picking this. It feels as if there's no way to make this *work* at the moment and I'm getting super stressed about it. 

I have a few questions that if anyone's done a secondary data dissertation/thesis, I would be eternally thankful to hear your answers, experience and advice!

1) How did you/would you recommend narrowing down your research focus? I've read so much around the subject it feels all jumbled in my head at this point and I'm scared I'm going to over reach. 

2) If you've done a secondary lit dissertation, how did you manage to actually answer your questions? How did you source your data (i.e. from academic papers, databases?). Did you use multiple data sources, and if so how did you try and bring these together to answer your thesis?

3) If on the off-chance anyone here has focused on sociology of mental health (or similar fields), are there any frameworks/theories you'd recommend looking into? I have found a few (notably social exclusion, social capital, and acculturation hypotheses for migration), but I'd appreciate any additional insights!

Thank you in advance, and (if anyone responds to my niche request!) I look forward to hearing from you.",1,2020-01-14 17:35:30
l3qcl5,WieIsDeDrol,t2_12697xt7,Advice about dealing with a professor,"I am a 3rd year PhD student (not in America). I need to hand in my dissertation after 5 months, so I am working on that. At the same time, I am working on a paper which was part of a research project, supervised by a professor at another university.   
For the entirety of the project I did basically all the work, which I understand (altough often he said he would look at something and then didn't). Since the duration of my scholarship is limited (which I need in order to pay for my living expenses), I cannot spend working on this project forever. So I decided to write down all the results, as a first draft for a paper, and e-mail it to him. For some months he didn't say anything, until I e-mailed him again and then he started going through what I wrote. Since then until now, he comments on parts in the draft, and I change it until he is happy with it. Only this goes very, very slow. 

The topic is in theoretical computer science, where actually most of the papers are really badly written. Contain mistakes and not easy to read. He and I prefer correct and easy to read papers. But for me he takes it to a totally different level. We can spend two weeks on something small. And if there is something he doesn't like, he will not read much further. So even the main proofs, which I wrote, he hasn't even looked at. 

And here I am under an insane amount of pressure, trying to get everything finished for my dissertation, delaying working on some other things because this project is still not done. I told him many times that I wanted it to be done before January, otherwise it would give me many problems.  
Maybe it is all my fault, I cannot write papers well enough so we need a lot of time. But I never had this problem before when writing mathematical texts (but no papers). Other professors were not as strict as him.   
 I am at the point where I cannot handle the stress anymore. When I meet with him I have to force myself not to cry or yell.  I just continue tweaking every detail until he's happy. But my mental health suffers a lot. I don't know what to do. Talk to my supervisor? But I think that because of their culture they will end up sticking up for each other, since I am just a foreign student.",1,2021-01-24 02:20:05
eohjpu,Benjbear,t2_9klyy,Considering dropping out of philosophy because of lack of challenge/depth. Anyone had a similar experience?,"Hello everyone!

I'm a 2nd year in philosophy at a top Canadian university and I'm on the verge of dropping out to relearn STEM skills and rethink my major. 

I am absolutely in love with philosophy - especially asian philsophy. I've reached a high level of proficiency in Japanese, began learning mandarin and ancient chinese (which is so fun after having learnt Japanese), and since my first year of high school I've loved to read buddhist philosophy, political philosophy and more recently western philosophy (particularly French continental philosophers since it's my primary language). I've done very well in my classes so far, and in my current semester I decided to take the highest level courses (other than honours seminars) that are offered in my uni's undergrad philo department. Problem is, even though I love sitting in class, discussing and writing about philosophy, I feel like university hasn't at all lived up to my expectations. 

I'm in some 4th year classes, but I don't feel challenged or that it's adequately in depth. In my Buddhist philosophy class we are reading really interesting Buddhist texts, but I have been doing that on my own for a while and it seems that in my undergrad we won't reach the niches and nuances I'm interested in. 

I still loving doing it. Discussing is fun, I can talk about my interests in my papers, my profs are inspiring, etc. But I feel like I'm not growing as a person. 

There are large parts of philosophy I still haven't explored, but I have no good reason to expect they will be any different in terms of benefits of studying at uni vs on my own. I think I just much prefer learning at my own pace instead of moving slowly through a reading each week, as pompous as that may sound. 

This has led me to want to drop out and relearn the skills I gave up on in HS when I had bad mental health: math, physics,chem and programming. After a couple semesters diving into those subjects on my own I could re-evaluate my major and move forward form there, even if I simply return to philosophy.

All this would be very different if I could rationally decide to pursue a PhD and become a professor, but even with my niche all the evidence I've seen seems to scream against doing that. I think it could be extremely rewarding, but studying asian philosophy at a top university where I'd have at least a chance of getting a job usually means not having almost any colleagues in my area of interest (according to guides on studying asian philo online). Even if I did find a position as a prof, it's unlikely to be in a location I desire which, somehow, is extremely important to me.

**Tl;Dr** Has anyone switched out of a major they're passionate about/good at because they want more of a challenge and want to develop skill sets they don't yet have? I would love to hear any advice! And sorry if my post came across as pompous - my main issue is having such a specific interest in philosphy/buddhism that I'm unlikely to find what I'm looking for in an undergrad (despite being at the uni with the biggest asian studies department in canada). Not trying to say philosophy is easy!

I have been struggling with chronic anemia as well as vitamin d deficiency, and I wouldn't rule out that I've become depressed because of my poor academic performance. 

Anyways, every semester but one has been a struggle, and I chalked up my poor performance to ""just college"" an ""procrastination"" etc. But I didn't realize that my iron deficiency had gotten so bad that I was sleeping 12-17 hours a day and kind of not feeling awake. I could sleep right after class and sleep right after with no issues. I was managing it with OTC supplements, which never worked for me, and doctor's never discussed that this was a long term issue.

Well this semester, like any other ones, in the beginning I'd thought it be my best. I started out strong, went to class, took notes, was genuinely interested, but I had a month of really bad bleeding and got wiped out so had to get iron injections. I've performed badly, and my not pass a class I need to graduate. I just had the take home final and it went very poorly. The exam was intended to be 5 hours, but it was a really a 25 hour exam. I didn't complete all of it, as did my peers, but I am in a precarious position grade wise as I was completing papers for other courses and just didn't have the time along with fatigue.

I would like to speak to my instructor about it, as she has been understanding. To see if there is anything I can do to just pass. But I feel bad as I don't know if this is appropriate. I don't want to coerce or bias her (thought she been in contact with my dean and we have spoke), have medical documentation, and I just thing being in university has exacerbated my illness and I think I really need to leave for my mental health as well.

I dropped 3 courses last term out of the 6 mandatory courses for my program, and I’m still only taking 3 courses this term. I wasn’t doing well during the 1st part of last term due to being in a bad mental health state caused by many issues happening around/to me (family members constantly quarreling, and I can’t move out due to COVID etc.). 

Now I’m cold emailing profs asking if they would be interested in supervising my research for fellowships (I’ll make sure that I’m eligible for those fellowships though). I wonder when and how should I let the profs know that I’m studying part-time. Should I include that in my cold email? I worry that profs won’t even finish reading my emails after seeing that I’m a part-time student… 

As an aside, my last term’s exams were deferred, so I haven’t gotten my final transcripts. This way, I could get away from sending them my transcript for now, and they wouldn’t know that I only have 3 courses last term from reading my transcript… But I do plan sending them my transcript after I got my final grades since that's expected to be included in those emails… Therefore, another option that I’m considering is explaining more about why I’m studying part-time after they find that out (potentially from reading my transcript) and ask me about it?

I also wonder if having my situation (family members quarreling etc.) is an acceptable reason for studying part-time? I’ve heard that mental health problems would be looked down upon in college/graduate applications, is this also the case here? If so, what could I do to reduce its negative impact?

While my struggles last year had to do with a toxic lab environment, I am now finding that I am struggling with the fact that I will prolong my time in the program. Not only did I switch labs, but I pretty much lost a year of productivity because of the pandemic. I am in my 4th year and fear that it will take me AT LEAST 2 more years to finish my degree. If I’m being honest, it looks like it’ll likely be closer to 3 and idk if I’m mentally equipped to handle that.

I HATE being in research, but I haven’t quite figured out what else I’d like to do so I’m kind of buying time by sticking with my PhD for now. I feel like I’m fighting panic attacks every day. Mastering out now seems like such a waste since I am already 4 years in, but I really don’t know if I can be here for more than 2.5years.",1,2021-01-19 07:39:23
l0gtx5,onmywood,t2_52l51ptr,Quitting undergraduate research position that will lead to publication,"Hello I am an undergraduate student who is currently in a new research laboratory. I have been working here for 2 months with little to no progress. I was promised a publication towards the end of the project but I'm sick of it. I am a senior so all my graduate school applications are submitted but I feel awful for quitting.

My biggest issues are:
1. The PhD student is my friend. I worked with him in a previous laboratory and he is closely connected with my previous PI that I want to work with in graduate school.

2. I also want to work with the current PI of this new laboratory in graduate school.

3. I am extremely depressed. Although my classes now are not as demanding, I want time to work on my mental health.

Basically, I'm tired and depressed. Earlier last year, I wrote and published as first author of a research paper during COVID. I got paid to worked full-time remotely for a laboratory in a different school over the following summer. During the fall, I applied to 11 PhD programs and 4 fellowships. Over the course of my undergraduate, this is my 3rd laboratory and I feel horrible for quitting in less than 3 months.

Please give me advice. I desperately need help. How will this affect my future prospects with the PI and with my first PI.",1,2021-01-19 09:57:29
l16sbg,Heiditha,t2_tc29c,Does anyone else feel like they aren't doing enough towards their PhD?,"So I'm a second year PhD student (UK) researching horror games. While I'm reading up on the literature, taking notes, working on my literature review and methodology, prepping for data collection next month, keeping an eye out for potential CfPs, attending (and sometimes participating in) online seminars, and making plans with my supervisor to hopefully do some guest lecturing down the line, there are times when I feel I'm not doing enough. I make it sound like I'm really busy, but I'm truly not. A lot of the stuff I've listed is hugely spaced out. Weeks go by without half of this stuff occurring.

&amp;#x200B;

As of now, I don't really know what to do to fill my time. I can read papers and take notes, that's no problem. But I just feel like a lot of the time I'm sat there thinking of what to do. I try to keep a weekly list of tasks I want to get done, but most of my days I feel I can walk away from my desk by 2pm. Sometimes earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if it's because there's this ideological view of what doing a PhD requires, but a lot of the blog posts and online posts I read from others suggests that this is an unbelievably busy period and there are simply not enough hours in the day and people's mental health is at stake because of the hours they put in. And honestly, I just don't feel like that. I find it very easy to walk away from my work (either in the evenings or to take breaks now and then) and I wonder if this is detrimental to my completing a satisfactory thesis. 

&amp;#x200B;

None of my supervisors seem to have any cause for concern and I have plans ahead of me, so I'm not stuck for anything to do. I just wonder if there's a toxicity to the whole PhD lifestyle which pressures people into thinking they have to work themselves into dust or it's not good enough. Maybe this is an American mindset. Maybe it's because of the subject matter I'm researching (I can do it all online from my own bedroom). I don't know.

My guide has been kind enough to let me work on my own idea and has been a phenomenal support to me. A week back, he said that we have enough data to publish and asked me to start drafting a paper. 

Here's the thing - I feel extremely underconfident in my writing skills and reading other papers only makes it worse. I feel like my scientific writing as well as research skills are pathetic and I constantly remain in doubt of my skills until someone else (mostly my guide) reminds me of my previous work. I cannot help but sink in negativity while writing and it is ruining my draft. How do you guys deal with such a situation?

I previously used to enjoy research and scientific writing  but due to a variety of factors such as including deteoriating mental health, financial hardships and family related issues, I no longer am able to focus or enjoy my work. Moreover, my vocabulary seems to have been terribly affected by my low self esteem and I no feel like I am able to communicate well in the paper. 

My guide thinks that my research would make a great publication and lead to much more research in the field,  but it makes me really sad that I would end up disappointing him with my awful draft. I am finding it really tough to gain confidence in myself, especially in the current situation.

Unfortunately, I am dealing with severe mental health issues. I suffer from paralyzing, debilitating anxiety and extreme feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy. Basically I am no longer a functional adult. I have sort of scrambled together a proposal for a thesis topic but I've now realized that not only I am not really interested, but I also cannot possibly manage to work on it - the topic is complex and would probably be positively challenging for a healthy student with a sound mind, but for me it only looks like an insurmountable hurdle. I am having panicked breakdowns on a daily basis and I cry a lot. I literally cannot even think about it without starting shaking. This covid crisis doesn't help either. I know I'm gonna mess up at one point or another and I know I'm never gonna be able to complete the project.

I am already seeing a therapist, but he can only do so much.

I should defend my proposal in a few days, but I haven't even prepared a presentation. My supervisor has no idea about any of this, he only believes I'm your average lazy brat (which I am - but that's besides the point). I'd like to speak with him about it, but first I am really ashamed, and second asking for a deferral is not possible in my case - I would have to quit altogether, because by deferring I would lose my scholarship and these studies wouldn't be financially sustainable anymore. But quitting in the middle of such an economical shitstorm, with my mental state, is not ideal either isn't it.

At the same time, I gotta be honest with my supervisor and all the other professors because they deserve to know and keeping on kicking the can down the road is never gonna work.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the two examples.  First is a portion of the original work by Exline (2013): 

&amp;#x200B;

***WHEN AND FOR WHOM DOES STRUGGLE ARISE?*** 

*Although struggle can be framed as a natural part of spiritual or religious development (Pargament, 2007), it can be useful to reflect on when—and for whom—struggles tend to arise. As described in the following section, many studies have assessed strug- gle in response to negative life events such as illness, and this seems appropriate, particularly given that negative life events often elicit negative religious coping (e.g., Bjorck &amp; Thurman, 2007). Yet, as we will see, there are many types of religious and spiri- tual struggle, and some might occur even in the absence of serious negative events.* 

*A large-scale study of college students (Bryant &amp; Astin, 2008) identified several religious and spiritual correlates of struggle. For example, greater struggle was associated with being part of a religious minority group, a quest orientation toward religion (see also Sandage, Jankowski, &amp; Link, 2010), and seeing God as elusive (i.e., mysterious, “universal spirit”) as opposed to beloved or protective. Religious and spiri- tual predictors also may vary on the basis of the type of struggle. Concerns related to desecration, for exam- ple, are more likely among religious persons who per- ceive violations to their sacred beliefs (e.g., Pargament, Magyar, Benore, &amp; Mahoney, 2005). Anger and disappointment toward God, in contrast, are more likely among those lower in religious commitment (e.g., Exline et al., 2011) and intrinsic religiosity (e.g., T. W. Hall &amp; Edwards, 2002) but higher in extrinsic religiosity (e.g., T. W. Hall &amp; Edwards, 2002). Anger toward God is also more likely when people see God’s intentions as cruel (Exline et al., 2011) and when they see such anger as morally acceptable (Exline, Kaplan, &amp; Grubbs, 2012).* 

*Several studies have identified individual- difference predictors of religious or spiritual strug- gle. Struggle has been associated with demographic factors such as being young (Exline et al., 2011; McConnell et al., 2006), female (Bryant &amp; Astin, 2008), and unmarried (McConnell et al., 2006). In terms of personality, struggle has been linked with insecure and anxious or ambivalent attachment (Ano &amp; Pargament, 2003; Belavich &amp; Pargament, 2002; T. W. Hall &amp; Edwards, 2002) and negative affectivity (e.g. Ano &amp; Pargament, 2003; Schotten- bauer, Rodriguez, Glass, &amp; Arnkoff, 2006; Wood et al., 2010). Anger and disappointment with God have also been linked to narcissistic qualities (Sandage &amp; Moe, 2011), such as tendencies to exploit others (T. W. Hall &amp; Edwards, 2002) and a sense of entitlement (e.g., Wood et al., 2010). Reli- gious or spiritual struggles are also more likely for those who report poor social support (McConnell et al., 2006) and family-of-origin stressors such as alcoholism (Szewczyk &amp; Weinmuller, 2006) and childhood physical or sexual abuse (Fallot &amp; Heckman, 2005).* 

&amp;#x200B;

And then here is my own work borrowing from their organizational structure and most of the citations they also used: 

&amp;#x200B;

***Religious and spiritual struggles have been associated with negative physical health outcomes and increased emotional distress*** *(Exline, 2013; Exline, Pargament, Grubbs, &amp; Yali, 2014; Exline &amp; Rose, 2005, 2013)**. Exline (2013) provides a thorough review of the literature on religious and spiritual struggles, organizing the findings between findings related to mental health outcomes and physical health outcomes, as well as identifying different groups of people who tend to experience religious and spiritual struggles. Borrowing from Exline’s (2013) approach, I will summarize who tends to experience religious and spiritual struggle as well as the links and correlates between religious and spiritual struggles and associated mental and physical health outcomes.* 

***For whom does religious and spiritual struggle tend to occur?*** *Religious and spiritual struggles occur for different groups of people and also differ based on how individuals view God and/or a divine figure. Bryan and Astin (2008) found in a sample of college students that correlates of religious and spiritual struggle included how involved a student was with a particular religion, their view of God (i.e. viewing God as a “Divine Mystery”, “Beloved”, or “Teacher”), their ability to have a compassionate self-concept, and whether they viewed their faith as a spiritual quest. Regarding viewing faith as a quest, other research has found a spiritual quest orientation to religion to have negative spiritual and emotional effects as well* *(Sandage, Jankowski, &amp; Link, 2010)**. Individuals who experience higher levels of anger or disappointment towards God are typically lower in their religiosity* *(Exline, Park, Smyth, &amp; Carey, 2011)* *and also endorse a more extrinsic religiosity* *(Hall &amp; Edwards, 2002)**. Individuals are also more likely to view God as angry when they believe God has cruel intentions* *(Exline, Park, Smyth, &amp; Carey, 2011)* *in addition to believing negative protests against God are acceptable* *(Exline, Kaplan, &amp; Grubbs, 2012)**.* 

***Differences in who experiences religious and spiritual struggles have also been observed based on varying individual factors.***  *Bryan and Astin* *(2008)* *found in a cohort of college students that correlates of religious and spiritual struggle predominated for those of a minority religious preference (i.e. Buddhim, Hinduism, Islam, etc.), were female, attended a religious institution, studied psychology as a major, and had experiences that challenged or introduced new worldviews. Another demographic factors that has been associated with religious and spiritual struggles is being young* *(Exline, Park, Smyth, &amp; Carey, 2011)**. Religious and spiritual struggles have been observed in individuals who exhibit insecure ambivalent, insecure, or anxious attachment to God styles* *(Ano &amp; Pargament, 2013; Belavich &amp; Pargament, 2002; Hall &amp; Edwards, 2002)**, and negative affectivity* *(Schottenbauer, Rodriguez, Glass, &amp; Arnkoff, 2006; Wood et al., 2010)**. Additionally, anger and disappointment towards God have been associated with narcissistic qualities* *(Sandage &amp; Moe, 2012)**, exploitativeness* *(Hall &amp; Edwards, 2002)**, and entitlement* *(Wood et al., 2010)**. Individuals who report lower levels of income and social support* *(McConnell, Pargament, Ellison, &amp; Flannelly, 2006)**, endorsed growing up in an alcoholic family* *(Szewczyk &amp; Weinmuller, 2006)**, and childhood abuse and sexual violence* *(Fallot &amp; Heckman, 2005)* *also show higher levels of experiencing religious and spiritual struggles.* 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not interested in feedback on aspects of the writing, etc. I strictly am interested in if this is academic plagiarism or not, so that I can change my approach and go about writing my literature review differently if so. Thanks.

I was supposed to have it finished by now, but took an incomplete because I had some (mental) health issues/family issues bubbling up my second semester of the yearlong process that got in the way of my thesis. I opted into the honors program which requires the thesis, which just requires an extra class + thesis over the regular program. 

However, I had issues with my thesis almost immediately in the fall semester I started it. My advisor's area of focus is not at all what my proposal was for. My advisor has also been incredibly condescending/mansplainy to me, asking circling rhetorical questions and providing no actual feedback or critique, which I've asked for in several different ways in case it was a communication thing. In an entire year, he has recommended me one book to read. We've had conversations about teaching/learning styles and approaches. 

For what it's worth, I'm doing a cultural studies thesis on a marginalized community's fandom engagement with three different media texts. I wanted to have a more ethnography-inspired approach, but my advisor has lead me in zero directions. A 15 minute meeting with an old prof I had once lead me down more prospective paths and I came out with a short reading list -- more than my advisor did in two whole semesters. 

After talking to my thesis advisor and academic advisor, I took a temporary incomplete to have an extra semester + summer to finish. 

However, here's the icing: already this summer I've been informed that both of my parents have (different) terminal illnesses. One parent is going into a sort of hospice center, and the other is in treatment for cancer. 

I really, at this point, do not have the oomph or unemotional logistical time to keep working on this thesis, especially with the advisor that i currently have. Is this worth talking to somebody (academic or thesis advisor?) about dropping my thesis? 

I'm hoping on, eventually, going for a master's (library science). How harmful would a big ole DROP note on my transcript look -- or is this something where potential applications might include a ""anything else about you?"" section where I could explain that? 

Really any advice would be really helpful, I'm not really sure what a good starting point is other than emailing my very sweet academic advisor, which I'm doing after I post this...",0,2019-06-09 19:21:34

This paper discusses the anxiety-inducing stressors associated with attending college and the proposal of a framework for a collegiate-based intervention program aimed at helping students succeed by educating them and the surrounding collegiate community on mental health, assessment of strengths and weaknesses. The main contribution of this paper is that it recognizes the rising presence of anxiety in college students and the author, seeks to curtail this rise by addressing it via establishment of an intervention program.

**Strengths**

· This paper targets a very specific and relevant population that needs intervention regarding anxiety.

· Your paper is well-organized making it easy to follow from one aspect of your paper to the next.

· Your placement of assessments before and after intervention suggest you’re aware of the requirement to have more than one assessment in order to evaluate the effectiveness of your program.

· **All** of your sources are **relevant to the purpose** of your paper and **current**.

**Constructive Criticism**

· Your introduction lacks clarity and focus – I’m not able to ascertain the purpose of your paper until **Section BII**: “In order to get to my personal goal to decrease anxiety in college students…”

· The paper is supposed to address the **Millennial generation**, yet there are zero references in your paper to Millennials or Generation Y.

· Since your paper is about decreasing anxiety in college students, Anxiety Disorder cannot function as a risk factor for itself. (**Section AI**)

· Section **BI:** “Researchers have suggested that one way that can help students benefit of succeeding college would be to take a course that can help them learn different study techniques…” I am confused as to how study skills are a protective factor against anxiety in itself. This requires a more in-depth explanation as there seems to be a gap missing in study skills to anxiety relief. 

· Your protective factors only seem to be geared towards academic anxiety—a very specific form of anxiety, yet your paper doesn’t specify any distinct types of anxiety. **Was your purpose to attack academic anxiety only or anxiety as a whole?** Please clarify.

· While the point of the paper is stated to be decreasing anxiety, there are a few statements that can confuse the reader in to thinking that the purpose of the paper is to help students graduate. While anxiety and its relationship to ability to graduate may be related, they are not synonymous and should not be confused as such.

· **There is no quantitative information in your outline to substantiate your claims**.

**Minor Comments**

· Your in-text citations are incorrect. Stacked/Double parentheses in your introduction are not necessary.

· Use hyphens to join words or parts of words (e.g. open-ended in BI, well-being in Ba, self-report in Bc.)

· There is incorrect spacing in your bibliography.

· There are some minor spelling and grammatical mistakes, albeit non-distracting to the reader.

**Overall**

You did a great job – targeting the college population is almost essential when it comes to planning to attack anxiety in Millennials!",0,2019-06-12 18:10:55
c0j9q9,sjdoesntknow,t2_1cjn2j70,Aspiring PhD student and lover of learning - how to make the leap?,"Hello AskAcademia.  I’ve just finished an MA, and I’m really interested in working in academia.  I have always wanted to do a PhD, I love learning, searching for information, playing with new ideas and writing, and I’m very self directed.  But I have no idea how to become “ready” to do a PhD.  I understand you need to apply for a PhD before looking for funding, or that some courses offer funding, but what experience/where do you need to be in your career before undertaking one?  I realise I’m a bit vague but I’d just love to know how to get to the next level in my studies.  

My MA was in an arts therapy.  I am an artist by background with 10+ years experience working in mental health, the charity sector, and the arts, but have never run a charity, research project or published anything myself.  I have lots of subjects, questions and topics that could be ideas for further study, but what else do I need to turn this into a reality?

Would be eternally greatful for any pointers on next steps.",0,2019-06-14 12:00:47

I am 13 classes away from finally graduating with my BA in Psychology with a focus on mental health and addiction these past few years. I am interested in pursuing my Masters in Social Work for therapy purposes or looking into PhD programs where I could attempt to make some differences from a social justice perspective after recent, personal events have taken place in my world.

If I were to pursue the latter, what would be some recommendations to begin exploring should I continue in this field? I've been a social worker for all intent and purposes for the last 10 years and I'm considering a career change but, I want to exhaust all options and seek some input from others who might be in similar programs and paths so that I could theoretically stand out a bit more as I near graduation with my BA finally

bby16u,thesaddestaccever,t2_3kxh592f,Is academic lifestyle for me?,"Hi. I’m a few months away from entering my undergrad (not the US). I’ve been seriously considering going the academia route for quite a while now.

I’m being homeschooled (self-teaching) by my own choice. Passed all the finals with flying colors, so I’d say I’m reasonably capable academics-wise. I just can’t stand the bureaucracy, numbness, and pointlessness of my country’s school system. One is left with no choices and decisions to make, no agency, forced to sit through listening to extremely outdated and mind-numbing things. Thus I quit. 

As long as I remember myself, I’ve been an independent free-starter who enjoys little to no supervision, having flexible schedules, and working on my own. Now I’m in doubts. 

Is the academic lifestyle a good fit for someone like me? I’m scared of the thought of eventually spiraling into having even more mental health instability and problems than I already have now. 

I’m not even sure I’ll be happy with having to attend lectures every day, it’s just not my cup of tea and I learn absolutely nothing this way, as opposed to teaching stuff myself. 

The reason for wondering about this now is about prioritizing things in the next few years (internships, trying to get work experience, finish some projects vs going to conferences, trying to publish in undergrad journals, etc.)",0,2019-04-11 10:00:46
8fmrcd,genesis05,,What is generally required at a minimum to pass a senior/honours thesis?,"Long story short, this past year I did a two-semester senior thesis in an area of machine learning.  90% of the work I did this semester ended up being scrapped about a month before the due date as I was debugging some code for an outrageously long amount of time and was running out of time to even begin getting my results.

Despite this, I am confident that the new approach that I developed is just as well researched and justified in terms of the motivations and context of the problem I'm solving. The only problem is that I haven't had time to implement the approach and apply it to the problem being solved (i.e., my results and discussion sections are currently empty).

I'm kind of hopeless at this point because my life has been centered around this thesis for the past 8 months and have probably put in close to 1500 hours on it, all the while my other grades have been suffering, let alone my physical and mental health. My supervisor has refused to give me information about what is ""passable"" after being asked several times this past month so i'm turning to you, reddit.

The thesis proposal (due in the first semester) was worth 40% which I did well on, and I had an  oral presentation worth 20% which I did alright on. With the remaining 40% being accredited to the final thesis report itself, comparing this to ""traditional"" classes where a 51% is enough to pass the course, I feel like I should be okay.  But of course my thesis is technically incomplete without any results.

Are senior thesis's usually strict pass/fails or do I have a chance of passing?

kx6xa6,aritrop,t2_zrwid,Indian PhD student in a Mathematics department in the US,"expecting mostly tldr responses as in other forums:

A shorter synopsis here (missing key incidents): [https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/155185/how-to-proceed-after-being-threatened-and-treated-poorly-by-university-faculty-a](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/155185/how-to-proceed-after-being-threatened-and-treated-poorly-by-university-faculty-a)

My(now deleted) long post on StackExchange from March of last year. Detailing a lot of garbage from our Math department; it's hard to get across the context in which these comments were made, and a couple of these could be deemed somewhat inoffensive here, but mostly the environment was such that even the couple of seemingly mild incidents mentioned here seemed extremely serious, compared to another PhD environment I had been in till 2016. Frankly, looking back, I wrote this in a very measured tone. The biggest trigger initially for me to want to make these things public was the constant frothing at the mouth ultra demeaning way in which a specific PhD student behaved with me from the very beginning(as mentioned later), and later began the same with other international students(who also felt worked up with far less interaction with him than me). However, a lot of further incidents kept happening even after thisna initial impulse to make things public.

The incidents from 2019 and earlier this year would all have been dealt with a lot better if the present head of the department didn't become seriously sick, and he remained the head of the department from earlier on. Another recently graduated student wrote to me on Messenger that ""The department is going to become even more racist if he is not here now"".

&amp;#x200B;

This behavior is mostly from Spring 2018 and then Fall 2019. These raised extremely serious safety concerns at that time, and an office to address this behavior did not even exist inside this university until 2019. When I did finally report this to the new office, they said they take it seriously, but then completely dismissed everything mentioned here. Prior to that the only place to report this was their HR department, and I faced a further round of harassment from them, upon reporting the Spring 2018 events. I'm an Indian PhD student.

Let's call the concerned person X. The chair is called Chair.

In Spring 2018 I was teaching a Calculus class and X was then the so called supervisor in these teaching matters; at one point I was grading undergrad exams in his office. On his office door is a newsclip of the professor who was viewed as a terrorist for doing math on the plane. The newsclip ended in self-reflection, concluding that the only thing 'we' fear more than immigrants is Math.

While grading, at one point X casually remarked that he was looking for his boarding pass. I casually remarked we should all be careful doing Math on a plane; when he very proudly told me 'no, I'm white'. I replied; 'well wasn't the guy in that incident also white'? then he smugly said as a putdown, 'yes, but he was Italian, I'm not Italian, I'll be fine’. There was another visiting postdoc well within earshot in the room with his back turned to us, as this was happening.

A few days later, I had been late for a few hours in finishing grading; something that literally always people are, including X (I also wasn't very pleased when on the prior evening, my advisor from back then needlessly insulted me in front of several other faculty members for coming to a dinner with a colloquium speaker, when I had no intention to really go there but for the fact that I thought he would expect me to be there). While no one else had an issue, one of X's minions, a fellow PhD student, came to my office and told me it's disgusting I was late and that he was shaking in anger as a result. I told him politely to leave and shut the door of my office. Upon hearing this, X came to my office seeming extremely bellicose, physically intimidated me and forced himself into my office, as if I was a criminal. I told him also to please get out of my office , after which he got out and went to chair's office and started complaining about me. No one was inconvenienced then because I was late for a few hours with grading, and every single time I have graded with people, one or more people have been late with grading.

After a midterm exam, X was asking opinions about how to grade a contentious question; one of his minions passionately said something to which X replied in a conciliatory tone ""I know you're from U Chicago and you think you know best, but I disagree""; I was right there and also tried getting a word in, and X looked at me with absolute detestation, suggesting you don't have a right to say anything here.

Earlier that day, I was hearing him talking down to a Chinese graduate student, telling him there's an American PhD student also in the room he would be invigilating in for the exam, and that student would take care of everything, and the Chinese student doesn't need to know any of the procedures for setting up the exam in the exam room.

During the proctoring, we had to add up some numbers for some reason and I was doing it in my head; X's minion was standing there and suddenly he lost it; started saying 'it's disgusting you guys can add stuff up so fast'; talking about some racist tropes he has in his head about Indians. This was said in a really loud and unpleasant tone. X was right there and heard everything but said nothing.

Afterwards as we were grading in the lounge, as a lot of people were joking around I facetiously remarked that I might comment in an Indian student's exam in an Indian language; which of course I was not going to do. X got triggered and became serious and cooked up a story of some Chinese students and postdocs talking in Chinese in the corridors that apparently made so many people suspicious that there were serious complaints. This was said in a room full of graduate students, many of them Chinese, who interact in Chinese between themselves and with other Chinese faculty or postdocs and no one that I knew of found anything wrong in it. At another time, he told me in our lounge when others were present, that our university might be a nice place, but there is a Jewish clique, and then there is a Chinese clique and the whole environment is very divided. At another time, in our graduate lounge with a lot of people present, when I was casually remarking, after many such casual remarks by American students there, that the traffic here in Boston reminds me of India sometimes, X snapped and very threateningly told me: don’t B-S me, I’ve seen so and so movie, I know what traffic in India is like. Although the “very threatening” bit was so commonplace that it kind of feels strange to point that out.

As is the norm, X would ask for questions from graduate student instructors, in order to make the final list of exam questions. Not a single one of my questions were used in the two midterms, although a couple were used in the final exam if I recall. I found it unacceptable that none of these questions had been used in the midterms; I know of at least one other Indian phd student whose questions had not been used either, and he was OK with it; but I was not, with the amount of time spent in making the questions.

Surprisingly X once suddenly forced himself into my office last Fall, upon hearing some complaint from a recently graduated student about such issues, probably something about my general countenance struck a chord with him and compelled him to rush in to check if there was more pent up trouble further down the road, and I politely tried ending the conversation, because it was not productive. He concluded in solidarity, saying how he too was very wary when he first came here as a PhD student, since he was scared he would have to learn Hebrew, because of a large Jewish population here.

I've lost count of how many times one PhD student that Xhangs out with has said outrageous things in front of me, often directed at me; repeatedly saying how 'there are some typical Indians around here', that 'Indians are taking over' (even though there have only been 3 or 4 Indian students at a time in our program, and for the last 4 years there have been no Indian PhD students here) and how 'it's so funny there is great color consciousness in India since you guys are all brown'. Often these things were said in front of many other people, and if I counted individual instances, probably such comments were uttered a few dozen times in my presence. At one other time, in front of me and another Indian student who had mentioned that the Supreme Court judges in India are not known expressly as liberal and conservative partisans as is the case in the US, this student began to openly say in a disparaging tone that the judges in India would be no good anyway, in comparison to the US.

In the very beginning, in front of several other graduate students, he would be talking about a specific slur against Jews, that I didn’t know about earlier, in the tone that he was just curious about it but not using it himself, but kept using it repeatedly in front of several people. There was no Jewish person present when he kept on saying this.

At first I didn't think much of it, and even thought some of his comments about Indians was intended to be amusing which I shouldn't have; but upon talking with him a little more it was clear he was saying all these things not as a joke but meant everything. The worst situation was last Fall when during a mandatory meeting a couple of PhD students including me brought up some issues regarding transportation and mental health issues among undergrads, and after it ended, this PhD student in front of everyone else began to loudly say 'how funny it is how he always complains, it was so funny' and then came to my office and still kept insulting me to my face, ignoring the fact that there was another American PhD student who was raising far more issues than me .

There's also another PhD student X hangs out with all the time, who would froth at the mouth in my presence in the beginning, and in the presence of a few other international students; and probably it was the worst and most prolonged dehumanizing behavior I've faced from anyone younger than me, with him talking with me (and also a few other international PhD students a bit later) in a vile and threatening manner like we are lepers; however this person was careful not to utter slurs. I’ve spoken to a couple of other international students and they have also felt unnerved by him for prolonged periods, but I should emphasize this began the earliest with me and he was in the same year as me. Regarding him, I was speaking with another international PhD student, who told me that if someone behaved like that in his home country with him, he would punch him in the face. And this international student had to interact with him far far less than I had to. If it was in my own country, I would probably not punch him, but call the Police dozens of times.

This student became a favorite of one of our teaching coordinators, this teaching coordinator is someone we had no option to avoid and who would harass some of us on the simplest of pretexts. Another Indian PhD student remarked in front of me and someone else, that “the treatment of international students by this teaching coordinator is extremely poor”. I happened to mention this to another Indian PhD student here who was seriously harassed by this teaching coordinator and who had been documenting that harassment. Then the former Indian PhD student came to know about it, and sensing he might get into unnecessary trouble with this being added to the pantheon of comments and complaints, began to aggressively say “I never said such a thing”. Another international PhD student who graduated and got a postdoc job elsewhere called me after the completion of his first semester there; he had taught and graded along with PhD students in his new place and said it was refreshing and cathartic not to get harassed about simple matters in grading like he had been here. I have personally been talked to in a needlessly condescending way about minor (non)issues in grading, and in the beginning asked to regrade things for the flimsiest of (garbage) reasons. It is tiring to even talk about the nuisance created by this person in simple matters of grading; generally when I have graded with other faculty members here or at my previous university, things have been far more normal. Both her and X, after working with us for more than a year and apparently claiming to know us well, called me by another Indian PhD student’s name, which particularly in the US is considered very bad form.

There is yet another former PhD student here who I have seen behave in a very aggressive and condescending manner with other international students and I’ve talked with other international students about it. I myself always said hi and hello like is the custom in the US, and very rarely heard any hi or hello in return, and on one instance, as I was passing him by in the corridor, this PhD student looked at me in an extremely aggressive and ugly way, which would unnerve and make anyone feel unsafe, and if something like this happened on the streets you would move away as quickly as possible from there.

Coming to the incidents of Fall 2019, let's call the person Y, a PhD student whose desk was right next to mine in the office. Starting in September 2019, he would repeatedly put his boot on a chair pointing straight at me, just a couple of feet away from where I would be sitting and working, and when I asked him to stop this, he would do so and then resume a few days later, and then say I purposefully moved in the view of his feet so I could claim that his feet were pointing towards me. (I had earlier tried to make eye contact suggesting that this is really very poor, with me having to see the underside of his boots from a couple of feet away, but he didn’t respond to my very polite non-verbal cues.) Then a few days later, he would say in a very overbearing tone that we should now look at the configuration of the chairs so he could explain to me how his feet were not pointing towards me; this is after the chairs had all been moved around within the intervening days. Hearing all of this, I had told him 'I have work to do and don't want to engage your third rate ilk'; which is not a nice thing to say, but under the circumstances seemed quite necessary. Afterwards Y saw me in the corridor and came eyeball to eyeball, with an extremely threatening body language, standing inches from me, saying in a theatrical way, ""don't you ever disrespect me ever again"", because apparently that was his sole privilege.

After this he began keeping his bag on a chair very close to my desk and far from his desk, in some kind of passive aggressive show of force. I took a picture of this and showed our Director of graduate studies, let's call him Z, and he knew of the previous incident, and he asked me not to get worked up over it, and that he 'noted' it. I said it's better to change offices for me; and this is done informally by grad students all the time. However, Z personally intervened and said that's not necessary, and we should get along. This might have been due to a personal dislike of Z towards me. I was always polite with him but didn't think the world of him to take his Combinatorics 1 class, but took a Combinatorics 2 class taught by a prodigious postdoc in the department.( It turns out I got two papers on my own from that Combinatorics 2 class, one of which now got a favorable review from a top Combinatorics journal.)

Z was miffed, and told another faculty member (as narrated by this other faculty member to me) how I can at all do research in Combinatorics (doing Combinatorics research was never my plan anyway) if I didn't take his Combinatorics 1 class and in turn this faculty member relayed this to me. At that time, I met with Z and he told me that one of the aforementioned PhD students who said things like “you f—ing Indians” to me and behaved in offensive ways dozens of other times, was just “special”, and I should just learn to live with it. Then Z, being from a Western European country, told me in solidarity, after having seen the list of alleged incidents, that “Americans don’t dress well”, and there are other similar kinds of general problems we always deal with.

I’m not sure exactly and would hope they both did the right thing by asking this other graduate student to leave when they were talking about me, but Z and this faculty member were both saying condescending things about me, as this other faculty member himself told me coming out of the office they were speaking in. I was then asked to go to this office a minute later to speak with Z, and saw this other PhD student sitting in that office and it seemed like he was grading exams for a while. I would hope the PhD student was asked to leave for the time when these two faculty members were disparaging me.

On November 14 2019, as I was just entering the office in a bit of a hurry, and Y was coming out coincidentally at the very same moment, I did my best to move sideways, and there was a huge amount of room for him to move out, he deliberately rammed his shoulder into me, and kept ramming it into my body for a good few seconds. This now got into the territory of physical assault; and I immediately screamed about this, and a seminar was going on, and people got startled and closed the door.

There were no direct eyewitnesses to this. Later Z(grad advising head) told me that Y talked with him and that Y was minding his own business and that I started screaming at him unreasonably. Then Z said that if I complained about this to the Campus police, then I would probably get expelled. To the credit of the chair of the department, he intervened and said no one can get expelled like this.

Z, the graduate advising head, also looked at documentation which listed comments by X about Italians, Jews, Chinese, Indians, and documentation of all the bellicose attitude from him, and then declared that none of this is offensive(he wrote this in an email that is with me). Then he told me I should have just let it go when another PhD student started saying stuff beginning with “you fucking Indians” or something very similar, and when this was said in front of the teaching faculty member X, instead of getting further appalled, I should have reasoned with X.

It is sometimes next to impossible to function properly in this kind of environment; and especially when things can get into the territory of physical assault so quickly and a faculty member with an axe to grind in this manner could step in. Compared to the previous graduate program I had been in, this was just a casually toxic environment; things like a graduate student who ordered a book through Amazon from India because it was cheaper and then in front of everyone began mocking what apparently was (to him) the poor presentation of the book as it arrived, or when in a nearby university during an AMS meeting an Indian mathematician with a bit heavy accent was giving a talk, a graduate student from our department began to openly laugh at the accent, looking at me like why I didn’t also laugh at that accent; when all the few dozen other people in the room were being serious with the talk (and some attendees seemed to have been old friends and acquaintances of this Indian mathematician).

There’s another faculty member here who says loudly to another PhD student, both taking it in a joking manner apparently, “don’t steal my f%$#ing car, you Albanians steal cars”, and the PhD student finds it funny and goes around telling people how funny this is. I was in the office of this faculty member when he said this; interrupting what I was trying to discuss with him. At another time, this faculty member said to his Complex Analysis class, “we have to kill the poles in the denominator”, then paused, and then quipping “let’s not talk about WW2 now”. Here, poles is a mathematical term, and Poles also is apparently a reference to Polish people.

The question is, how do I tie these incidents together with the incidents from the other post, and mention how it can sometimes be very difficult to function in such an environment, and that they should immediately stop threats of expulsion? To the immense credit of the department, I now have a new office which is peaceful. However, right in the next office is a guy who has unnerved many of the legal aliens in the department with his weird and threatening body language and behavior.

Edit: I see that some people are saying how putting your feet up is not a big deal in the US. I've seen this among officemates before, some good friends of mine, and it was perfectly fine. In all those cases, they were not pointing their feet squarely at me with such an obviously poor body language, and they were polite enough that if I would tell them I found it disrespectful, they would be mindful of that. In this instance, I told this person to stop, yet he started doing the same thing after a few days, having the audacity to say I purposefully moved in view of his feet to claim this; as if I have nothing else to do. Hence my response was a necessity.

Update: Y has currently graduated and has been taken in as an instructor within our department and is apparently going to be teaching graduate courses. The other graduate student who used racial slurs against me was called special by Z and Z told me he deserves our understanding. At the same time, I’ve been constantly harassed and hounded by the university administration and threatened by their lawyers. This of course is explained by the fact that after the Office of Diversity and HR told me everything is fine, I asked them in return how they would like it if I made these things public knowledge.

Part3:

I'm an Indian Mathematics PhD student somewhere in the US, and have been working with a faculty member affiliated to a university near mine, from the beginning of 2019. At the end of November 2019, I completed the proof of a problem given to me, under the so called guidance of this faculty member, although he had very little to do with it for a long time, except one contribution in the end, which was commendable. Once he came up with this alternate way to prove what I had already proved, he immediately began to call my work rubbish, and said, you will only write my argument in your thesis. Towards the end, I implored him to write the part that he thinks he is correct in, since it was going to be a joint paper, but he said that no, I must rewrite things and incorporate his idea and do the rewriting even when it was going to be a joint paper.

An update to this is that the paper was quite late in being written by me; months after it should have already been written. I asked my advisor then to become a co-author but then surprisingly he refused; this is two months after I had stopped speaking with him. Recently the paper was peer reviewed by a very reputed journal and the referee said the arguments are all deemed correct.

He began to continuously berate and belittle everything I have done, and grew extremely hysterical when I suggested a similar but different result was also within reach, which he didn't think possible. We were once sitting in a casual eatery, and I was calmly trying to explain some arguments, and he seemed extremely agitated, talking over me, calling the arguments wrong, but then trying to explain the same thing to me, as if it was his argument.

I would have written up the project and sent for publication, but the extremely hostile attitude of this person stopped me from doing that. After mid-December, he again contacted me in the middle of January, and he expected me to regurgitate all the proofs to him again and again till the middle of March and do nothing else in that time with him. He would condescendingly tell me what according to him is right and what is wrong, in this time interval.

It's unbelievable that he would prevent me from writing down the next result which he believed was not possible, but which would take an hour to decide on, with a receptive person. I found this an unacceptable waste of my time, and also if I had to look for jobs and graduate in 2021, this was an unacceptable delay in sending the paper to a journal, although realistically the plan was to graduate in 2022.

I'm appalled by this kind of hostile attitude on a project where the techniques are so elementary, essentially nothing more than the pigeonhole principle is used, although things become a bit complicated. I would often tell him I have certain things figured out, and don't have to write it out since it is simple enough; and he would say OK; then next week he would completely berate me saying you know nothing about this. Perhaps not accustomed to working with someone who he feels superior to, that too from India, who did things much quicker than he anticipated.

I had been speaking with a noted emeritus faculty member here, who is a renowned Combinatorialist, and telling him what was going on, and he sounded genuinely sorry for me in this situation but told me he was powerless to do anything about it. He was the only person who sounded genuinely sympathetic in this situation, when I wrote to him saying, to paraphrase, “having been in another US university, I didn’t expect this kind of ethnocentrism to be propped up like this”. I also sent a futile email to Z about what was happening, who only replied writing that my then advisor would have solved the problem even if it was not for me. In a later correspondence, Z said that there was enough reasons to expel me on academic grounds.

Upon reporting this behavior in December 2019 to the department, I immediately began to get threats of expulsion. This is at the time when I had two publishable projects near completion. For my own good, I had to think to try to work with someone else, and I tried to talk with a faculty member about a particular problem in his area of expertise that I did substantial reading on and that I found interesting and wanted to work on. He completely ignored me. Despite this, during those times, at least 4 to 5 times I heard over a span of three months that my funding should get withdrawn and that the department would not be able to keep me.

The faculty member who I was once again interested in working with, had himself started advising an Indian student who was in his 4th year, in Spring 2018, although this student didn't have any completed projects till then. Our department is such that at least five people have changed advisors in their 4th year (at any single point we have &lt;30 PhD students) in the recent past, but none of them were threatened like me; and I doubt any of them could probably also objectively defend a thesis in their 4th year, before switching advisors, if they had to. Now I'm working with another mathematician in a nearby university, and in the process I have had to change to another area of research this late, which is not a great thing.

Other incidents:

(i)The shoulder bumper alleging that a faculty member told him he wouldn’t get admitted if not for his white sounding name, him being Asian American.(Also this faculty member allegedly jokes around Chinese undergrads how like him they can't pronounce certain letters of the alphabet) Then an Indian student alleging that the shoulder bumper told him he shouldn’t be allowed to teach because of what he deemed his terrible accent, and the Indian student actually claiming in writing in an email that he had to really control himself in the past from getting physical with the shoulder bumper due to his behavior.",0,2021-01-14 14:43:35
7gs8ap,beautifulsubterfuge,,Fourth year student with a very rough transcript - advice on moving forward?,"I'm a fourth year student in Ontario, looking for a bit of advice. I apologize because I'm sure this has been discussed many times already, but I'm hoping to get some insight into my particular situation. 

I am interested in graduate studies but my GPA is way too low at the moment for me to even consider applying. I struggled quite a bit in my first couple years with some personal issues (financial/mental health) and those issues really got in the way of my academic work. I also didn't deal with the academic fallout in a responsible way and I let things keep piling up. Overall, I failed 6 courses from simply not doing the work or showing up for classes, and I've got 6 voluntary withdrawals on my transcript. 

Since, I've gotten to a much better place and I've realized that I do want to pursue graduate studies at some point in the future. Outside of the failed classes and the VW's, my grades are fairly high. I will be staying another couple semesters to raise my GPA, but with such a rough transcript, I'm not sure if graduate school is really an option even if my overall average gets better. 

So I'm wondering if it will even be possible to get into a graduate program at this point? Should I focus instead on gaining work experience in my field and put off grad school for a while, or should I retake as many classes as I can to bump up my average as much as possible? I realize I've dug myself into quite a hole here, but I'm definitely willing to put in the work to dig myself out. ",0,2017-12-01 03:30:55
71bfhx,suttiwit,,I can't write long papers?,"Alright. If it helps to determine the context: I'm 17 years old just a few months ago, I write quite a lot of documents (mostly about mathematics, computer science, and sometimes languages), and I hardly ever take a break from it (because I don't want to). I write those papers even though other people in my class are way smarter or do better than me.

I have been writing serious document seriously since I was about 16 years old. Now, one year has passed and I am still writing lots and lots of documents, but it has only been one year. In the period of one ""short"" year, my eyes have started to bail out. The effect of writing some papers that aren't even more than 2000 words long each for only one year seem to make my eyes go blurry. So, blurry in fact that I have difficulty writing after only a few minutes without getting headaches of some kind.

Perhaps the font size is too small, you ask? Well, let me tell you that one of my old friend used to say that they wrote essays and papers in 11pt. I got kind of jealous since I had always been using 12pt or 14pt (for personal papers). So, since then, I have always been using size 10pt (one size lower than my old friend) not because I want to, but because I want to overcome my mental turmoil of jealousy (LaTeX usually defaults to 10pt anyway). The person I got jealous of seems to write a paper from start to finish using nothing but 11pt; they don't seem to do the stuff I do or like writing much, but they seem to have a very bright future set ahead of them (and so I guess that writing small implies a bright future (QED! Fallacious? I know, but I'm kind of furious)). So, please don't suggest writing in one large font size and changing the font in the end, for I won't give up that easily. And it would really suck if my eyes give in right now because I really need to satisfy my depressive jealousy.

Okay, well, LaTeX does default to 10pt, which makes me happy because it is smaller than the person's writing, but the terminal I'm using to write the LaTeX source has this font set:

    URxvt*font: 9x15

Uhm... I don't know what font size that is, to be honest. I am quite afraid of it being 15pt. If my concerns are proven, I may have to change it to a smaller size for once.

Papers also take me a very long time to process. I have heard of people in college or university who write 5000-10000 words worth of text in one day or two and they do it well. I just don't seem to do it that well if I only had a day. Worst of all, it actually takes me half a day just to write 906 words of text non-stop! Why am I like this? Do I have ADHD or a learning disability or something? Why can't I be as good as others even if I actually consider myself a native speaker of English! My typing speed also converges at a limit of 96 wpm, never more, which may be another factor.

If my health and my brain cannot cope with papers just this size, then I do not know if I would even survive in uni.

I'm really afraid that I might not make it in college or university, that's all.

Here is an example of the paper that took me half a day. **It isn't really a paper,** but it should give you some ideas as to what kind of stuff I typically write, and you can extrapolate that yourself. Here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/sxpzpzktmxsb#/42013047/

I just cannot believe it took me half a day just to write some answers to some questions.",0,2017-09-20 14:28:59
clbx01,iamatonkatsu,t2_4aeg67bm,Advice needed on how to cope with labmate and grad school,"I'm currently in my master's program for a year now and I have 2 semesters left before I graduate. I want to know how I can get along better with my labmate and do better in my program. My labmate and I have had a bit of a tension especially in regards with my work --or rather the non-existence of it. My professor hasn't assigned me anything big except right now to stimulate cells and treat it with a certain compound. That's what I've been doing for the past two months and it's also a bit frustrating since the cells have only responded once to the stimulation and I am currently trying to solve this problem. 

What I'm frustrated about is with my labmate. She has confronted me recently (although this has happened multiple times) that I'm not doing anything in the lab. I explained to her that my passage confluency was too small so I had to wait until friday and saturday to do my experiment. She then proceeded to go on with, I can practice my western blot technique and asking if I can do it perfectly (also claiming that she can't do it perfectly too that's why she keeps doing it). The thing was, our post-doc said that I didn't have to do WB anymore and that I would just need to start practicing how to do PCR. This, I also explained to her. She then explained that WB is just as important as PCR. After that, she told me that I can also do some staining with our previous paraffin blocks. I told her that I tried to section the old paraffin blocks, but the cuts weren't very clean because they were already cut before and the blocks that I had left (1 per group), I decided to keep and reserve in case I would need to do it again if I do my final paper. She then proceeded to tell me that I shouldn't study in the lab (I have an upcoming international licensure exam next week and I only started bringing my materials to the lab 1-1.5 weeks prior, but then I do the online review on my computer). She tells me that I should do experiments in the lab and I should just study at home at night. She ends it by saying that I should work harder.

This is what frustrates me. My reasoning behind not doing any of those was first, I was waiting for my cells to grow. I also believe that even though continuously practicing technique is good even though it's just poking at the presence of beta-actin, I feel like it's a waste if I'm not actually looking for something. So since my cells aren't responding yet, I don't see the need to do the western blot for now. Partially, I think it's because it looks bad on our lab that I'm just in front of my computer while the other students from other labs sharing the same room as us are always doing something but I don't really mind because I know that I am working on something even though it's not 5 experiments or assays in a week kind of thing.

I honestly think our personalities just don't match. I'm very tempted to stop my degree and go home as I am taking my degree in another country. Maybe it's even the cultural difference because the work culture here is very different than back home. I can't even switch labs since I'm under a scholarship which prohibits me to do so. I actually like learning even though research is hard because I'm slowly getting the hang of it. I don't mind having experiments that take 12 hours or more as long as I actually learn or gain something from it. What I don't like is staying in the lab for 9 hours even though I don't have anything to do and I can't even study what I want to study.  I guess I'm the type that does what needs to be done and that's it. Nothing more, nothing less. Is it bad if I think that way?

Sorry for the long post, and I just really needed to get that off. My mental health in grad school is draining and I can't. What's bad about this is that it's not even the coursework that's draining me but the people around me. I just even realized I don't have friends in this city except for the ones I've went to language school with prior to starting my degree. I've been thinking of going to therapy so that I can do better in my thought processes but man, it's really expensive especially for someone who's only under a scholarship.

If you've reached this far, thank you so much for reading it. I appreciate any feedback you guys would have especially on dealing with my labmate and coping up with grad school. I hope you guys are pushing through the day, one paper at a time. &lt;3",0,2019-08-02 23:57:00

dnncpq,marblemenow1,t2_14s0t7ve,Hoping to get into a PhD program for Information Science with a 2.72 GPA :(," I just want to say that I want to get a PhD in Information Science or a related field in some time. However, my undergraduate GPA at Cornell University is 2.72 due to these major life events.

During the spring semester of my freshman year, my backpack got stolen, which drastically affected my mental health and caused me to drop out of my introductory CS course. As for the fall semester of sophomore year, I was dealing with anxiety and undiagnosed ADHD and ended up with a D in linear algebra due to a combination of factors that I don't feel comfortable mentioning in Reddit.

I ended up taking a year off of university, which is why I have many W's on my transcript for the Spring 2018 semester but I came back to get a B+ in web programming and a B- in linear algebra as well as a C+ in discrete mathematics. Gosh, I wish my GPA was better when I came back from my year long leave of absence but it is what it is.

Currently, I'm taking Networks, Introduction to Learning Analytics (a graduate level course), Independent Reading and Research, Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures, and Engineering Probability and Statistics II. So far, I'm doing okay on these courses except for Networks and OOP and DS. I will try my best to bring up my grades for the last two years of my undergraduate career, especially that I did poorly in the first two years (except for freshman fall) in my subjects.

My ultimate goal with doing a PhD in Information Science or a related field is to do industry research in technology (I will be more detailed once I have the time to concentrate on my life goals and not grind on my problem sets.) Knowing that I love my research at the Future of Learning Lab, which I did for three months, as well as my research at the Social Dynamics Lab in which I am conducting research about mental health and self-help subreddits, I want to conduct my original research in these following areas (but are not limited to): a more inclusive book recommendation system that isn't Goodreads and features authors of different backgrounds rather than just the most popular reads, the perceptions of Western media vs. local media in the drug war in the Philippines using natural language processing and neural networks, and a website or a mobile app that helps people with executive function (e.g. ADHD, autism, executive function disorder) using machine learning and natural language processing.

Anyway, I'm confused how to get into graduate school. I was thinking of taking a year or two off to enter the workforce as a data scientist at a company and then go back into graduate school.

di89d7,SocialWorky2017,t2_4ra60hp,Not being invited to speak on my research expertise (social sciences),"Hello,

I don’t know if I will be able to explain this clearly, but I’ll try anyways.

In my hometown, I have been able to get media exposure in the last couple of years, mainly on the topic of mental health where I had to share my story for the most part.

I am now a doctoral student, but my research focuses mainly on sexual violence. I have started doing less and less public speaking due to the fact that I am very busy with my Ph.D, and that I have gotten tired of sharing my personal story. But also because I want my expertise on sexual violence to be recognized as it is my topic of research and the field I want to teach in eventually. I also have work experience in this field and did my master’s degree on this topic.

The thing is that I rarely get invited by the media to talk about my topic of research. It is  #firstworldproblem, I am well aware. To get myself ""out there"", I have written and published quite a few op-eds in the past months in major media outlets, but still, I have gotten very minimal requests (three interviews) to speak about those since September. I also joined two databases of experts that media can reach out to and have highlighted my research expertise in those.

I don’t know if this has to do with the fact that I am a racialized woman, but I see other (white) doctoral students get invited to speak about this topic in talks and in media daily. Clearly, I am not even considered while it is my expertise as well (and that I bring critical perspective to it), it seems like the journalists don't know that it is my expertise and think of me mostly when it's time to speak about my personal story/mental health recovery. The fall is a very busy season in terms of anything related to sexual violence, and I still don't get many requests to speak.

I don’t know if I am right to feel like this, the people who get invited are excellent. But I have this feeling like I’ll have to work x1000 more to get my expertise recognized, even though I have won a very prestigious doctoral scholarship for my research project and my skills.

Any advice?",0,2019-10-15 13:55:57

d8kdl9,koolio92,t2_gpxp6,"Bad grades, no research experience, going back into science?","I went to university studying Immunology but university as a whole was rough for me because I was a poor international student (on scholarship) and my mental health was really bad in general. I graduated with 3.29/4 cGPA, 0.01 point away from minimum requirement of most grad schools in Canada but most of my bad grades actually came from my last two years of study, which definitely doesn't help. I also didn't have any research experience. I tried multiple times to get it during my second, third, and final year, only one professor got back to me and she just gave me pointers to improve my application. Funny enough, I actually put myself into one of the most difficult undergrad programs at my uni because they promised research opportunities for their students only to be rejected from that exact same opportunity because they told me that my cGPA was too low for their research work. I graduated with bad grades AND no research experience at all.

I have since been working odd jobs in admin and project management that have nothing to do with my interests. Just a job to pay the bills kind of thing and also a job to help secure my immigration. On the flip side, I became a permanent resident of Canada few months back and I definitely have better grasps of my own mental health/time management/maturity. Anyway, even prior to becoming PR, I have always wondered if it's still possible for someone like me to transition back to science. It's been 3 years now and I thought with getting a PR (more doors open), I should probably start looking into ways for me to get back into science. The thing is, with no research experience and mediocre grades, I feel like I'm stuck and unable to find my way in. I want to volunteer but labs will most likely prefer to take in undergrads/actual students. I'm even looking at professional healthcare degrees but my grades are obviously more heavily weighted there. I'm contemplating taking a non-degree year to improve my cGPA but I'm scared if it will just be a waste of money. Then, there's the age factor, I'm turning 27 this year.

Sad thing is because I've never done research, I really don't know if I like it or if I'm just romanticizing it. If you ask me right now, I'm probably an industry guy but without ever doing research, I really don't know. If it's any indication, I really enjoy the planning phase of projects at my company and quite well known for my attention to detail (admin wizard here). Plus, there have been many incidents where my bosses, mental health counsellor commented on how I am logical minded and tend to be problem solving. I specifically know that I need to go back to science because my small talk conversation with colleagues at work involves me explaining to them HIV pathogenesis!

97u8oh,medsciblues,,How do I stop taking on more I can handle? Is this a toxic mentality? Please help if possible,"Hi,

I am an undergraduate in my junior year of college in the U.S and I feel like I keep on taking on more than I can handle, and I have this urge to not stop. Spring 2018 was my first semester where I had a semester GPA of &lt;2.0. This summer, I had to take calculus based physics which was 5 weeks, calculus based statistics, which was also 5 weeks, and a 10 week calculus course all the while trying to work and do research; it didn't end well academically. I now have to send in an academic appeal form to get any form of financial aid back. I think I will likely get it back since this is the first time and my overall is still OKAY, but that isn't the point of this post.

I have friends who started since freshman year, getting involved since day one of college, doing this and that, and I feel like I am somehow...behind. My GPA has absolutely tanked within the past few semesters, and I acknowledge it is taking on too much, but at the same time, not being able to acclimate to the time restraints I have set up myself. So each semester, when I notice something ""wrong"", I acknowledge it, and then I try to fix it, by saying ""I know what I did wrong, so let me do it again"".

I wish I could try to stop trying to do so much in all aspects of my life, but I can't help but feel if I stop at any moment in trying to better myself or looking for new opportunities or experiences, I'm going to be left in the dust and be poor/homeless/unemployable for the rest of my life.

I have been doing research in a lab for 2 years now, and one thing my PI and grad student have said is that I need to have patience (Unsure what that means), and grad student has told me that I'm not superhuman and can't expect to do everything without cutting losses (which I understand). But I'll reiterate that when I acknowledge these things, I tell myself, ""Oh, I know what I did wrong, so let's fix it by doing it again but with the mentality that I know what I did wrong"".

After this poor spring and summer semesters, I am actively (again) trying to get involved with another project and looking for a job related to my field of study on campus as well as trying to learn a new skill that would be lucrative in the work force.

I feel like the way I am living is toxic for my mental health and I don't want to let up on or lessen my load because I feel like I'm giving away opportunities and not maximizing my time. I hate to say this, but whenever I have leisure time, I have feelings of guilt as if I am wasting my time. I don't think this is an envious issue, but rather a battle with myself. 

I feel like part of this realization stems from seeing how my parents lifes were after taking refuge in the States, but I don't know.

If anyone has fought this battle, please try to enlighten me on how to deal with it.",0,2018-08-16 17:20:57
343ity,blueberrythoughts,t2_jqhtl,Do I have to minor in something?,"Hey AskAcademia, 

I hope this is the right place to post this. 

I am in my third year at a private university getting my BS in I-O Psychology. I transferred here from a community college about 6 months ago. Because of that, some of my classes didn't transfer over correctly, meaning I have plenty of transfer credit but no specific transferable sources to apply the credit to. It may be important to note that I am planning on attending grad school for I-O Psych as well. 

So here's my dilemma - I *could* be done with my degree in exactly a year. Graduating on time would be amazing, and much better for my mental and financial health. However, that completion date assumes I do not minor in something. If I do, it will most likely take two years. I do not have anything I would particularly want to minor in that would be useful for my resume - maybe Web Design? But I don't know if it is worth it, especially if I continue on and get a Master's. Will employers be turned off if I do not have a minor on my resume? Is it blasphemous for me to not have one? Any other thoughts as to how I should proceed?

Last fall, I was taking a theatre class and I had a bit of a crisis, so I had to go my school's counselling services before the class, and it ran through the class, so I missed it. This wasn't the first time I had missed the class (again, mostly for at-the-time undiagnosed mental health issues), but I was within the accepted number of allowed absences. I got a note from counselling services and gave it to my instructor during class, and he said to meet him in his office hours to discuss an alternative assignment to make up for my missed participation points for the day, which is his policy for excused absences. When I went to his office hours, he told me multiple times that I obviously didn't belong in the major and he didn't know why I was there, that my work ethic, along with that of other students in the class, was deplorable, that in the real world I would never make it against even some of the other people in the class, and that I should seriously rethink my future if I think this is something I want to do.

Now, I'll admit that I'm not 100% confident in what I want to do in my future, and the specific realm of theatre that class was a part of (acting) is something that I decided I wasn't interested in pursuing professionally (partially because of this, partially because I found things that better satisfied me creatively). But also, that seems like a lot to me, especially given that I did do all my assigned work, and most of that is direct quotation. I didn't do anything at the time because I wasn't sure what I could do and I was worried about him retaliating in my grades, or at the very least, I didn't want to increase tensions even more by taking official action against him. I finished out the class with a B. I stopped taking acting classes after that and he went on sabbatical this year, so I haven't had to interact with him since then. 

I recently found an article in the student newspaper from last spring, the semester after I took his class, about professional oversteps by him and one or two of the other acting faculty, where they allegedly made an uncomfortable or discriminatory classroom environment, which reminded me of the conversation that we had, and made me ask myself: should I try to do something about it? Should I take the concern to a higher-up in the department?

3o2b9p,backwardinduction1,t2_j66uj,Depressed about my Future.,"I'm feeling generally, anxious, stressed, and depressed after my first 6 weeks of grad school. While I won't tell you guys what exact shcool I go to in order to keep their reputation safe, I just feel like I need to vent and get some advice. I go to a top ranked school of public health for an MS in environmental health. My utlimate goal is to get a PhD, but for public health schools you almost always need a masters degree before you can even get into a PhD program.

I'm worried for two reasons:

1. I have the option to feed into the main doctoral program as a third year after the compleion of my master's degree, provided that I actually get in to that much more competitve program that has half as many spots as my current program (or possibly less based on departmental changes I've noticed). If I do this I continue on with my studies, do my dissertation and finish after a total of 5 years at the school. If I go to a different school for my PhD, it will probably take me 5 years there, so a total of 7 years of grad school.

2. I'm not fully sure I want to go into this specific area/field of public health or continue with public health after my masters. I'm extremely interested in GIS and urban planning, and while I'll have opportunities to take elective courses in these fields, I wonder if getting a PhD in those fields would be a better fit for me. Of course GIS oozes its way into every field, including mine in some circumstances, so I know it'd help me. Theres a lot of overlap between environmental health and urban planning, so I have hope that something will work out, but I'm not sure what will happen, and the uncertainty of it all, and the fact that I'll have to apply for things next fall is stressing me out.

I started doing lab-work for this one research project going on at my school. I wouldn't exactly call it research per se as its just lab work, and its related to air-exposure-assessment, so I have my doubts about whether deciding to it was a good idea or not. It pays well, which is a nice enough incentive, but would something like this be at all valuable for the future thats going to collide with me sooner or later whether I like it or not?

Just all the stress of keeping my grad school grades up, trying to be a competitve PhD applicant, trying to progress to do actual research by the time the spring roles around, trying to figure out what I want to do with my summer (we have to either do research or an internship then) and trying to figure out what I want to do with my life is just giving me a lot of mental anguish. 

What do I do?

6r0tdx,academiaquestion1,,"Trying to petition for removal of grades due to hardship. I made a mistake and finished my courses while dealing with domestic violence and severe mental health issues. I received C-'s, but the grades were really way lower & the result of teachers curving/bumping grades (sometimes for whole class).","**Background**: undergraduate who has faced numerous obstacles, including domestic violence, homelessness, and severe mental health issues. Trying to appeal for withdrawal/removal of grades from past semester(s).

**Story**: My registrar's office rejected the first appeal on the grounds that 1) C-'s aren't low enough for removal (I wish I had known and not tried!) 2) severe domestic violence and severe mental health issues aren't severe enough circumstances.

Rejected petition in hand, I went to every academic and counseling resource I could find at my school, asking for advice. All the university officials seemed scared to give me advice on my case, as though they didn't want to break any rules by helping(?) me too much. One lady *did* tell me that I should try soliciting letters from professors.

So now I've emailed two professors, asking for help.

One of these professors gave me a C- in a class where my otherwise D/F-grade was bloated by extra credit/work. He also had a TA to whom I had mentioned my anxiety. Remembering these things, I asked him to write a note explaining that 1) my grade was a ""pity grade"" and 2) that I had mentioned anxiety to the TA. He tersely replied by refusing to acknowledge that he gives out ""pity grades,"" and then he said that the TA doesn't remember me mentioning anxiety.

Frustrated but persevering, I emailed a second professor--this one a private music teacher whose classes I received A's in. I've mentioned that I've dealt with domestic violence, homelessness, and mental health issues to this professor before. She has a pessimistic personality, thinks mental health issues are a scam, and discourages a lot of students from their career and academic goals. But, nonetheless, she's the professor I've known best and longest. So I asked her for a note supporting my petition.

**Conclusion/help request**: So, at this point, I've faced myriad obstacles, but I'm desperately trying to figure out *how to strengthen my appeal's case*. My school told me that this second appeal is my last chance at the matter. I'm going to ask my private therapist for a note( I'll reuse a note from a previous university therapist; and I'll have a note from this other pessimistic professor. The notes from the school therapist and private therapist will likely only say ""we saw this patient on (dates way after the bad semesters),"" because of their medical regulations or what have you.

- What more can I do to strengthen my case?

- How should I phrase my appeals letter?

- How can I get the committee to understand the gravity of the situation? My private circumstances remain tenuous, for example, and I am dealing with violent people on my personal life.",0,2017-08-02 01:17:33

I already have a lot of anxiety around academia and have come to the conclusion recently that I don't really want to enter a career in the degree im currently doing. I've also realised that i'd really like to do more arts and creative stuff. I've had panic attacks and worry through the whole degree so far and even though my grades have been pretty strong I feel like im too fragile mentally to really deal with it anymore. I'm at a crossroads - i can finish off the dissertation despite the strain on my mental health, or i can leave and move onto healthier pastures. i dont think that taking time off and coming back would really be an option for me because i'd get way too nervous about returning. My parents dont support the idea of dropping out, especially when getting a job at the moment would be a nightmare. I'd like to pursue illustration and comic-making which I already do on the side as well if I can. The degree is in an art school but its very much more of a research-based course rather than creative.

If you've ever dropped out of a degree at any level, why did you do it and do you regret it? I've spoken to tutors about this and the ball is in my court apparently. I just don't know what to do.",1,2020-05-13 12:57:34

I am pursuing a master's degree in computer science. I am in the second year and have to do my thesis, which is the only thing missing before i complete the programme.

As I write in the title, i am losing my motivation. Before I started the programme I was working as software engineer, and I quit in order to come back to academia because I had missed learning. The first year of my studies I was very motivated and energetic, planning to even go on for a PhD.

But now it seems that I am losing interrest. To the point that I devote very few hours per week on working on my thesis. Of course the whole covid situtation is not helping either. Have you had similar experiences in your academic career? Losing a lot of interrest in academics, especially in a period that was critical and would probably shape your next few years?

I understand that academia are associated with a bunch of mental health issues that could lead to experiences like mine, and I am trying to address these as best as I can. But I am asking you if you have practical advice on how to overcome them in the short term, since the next few months will be very important.

I tried to post this on offmychest but it was removed because of the link to COVID-19. I'm hoping for catharsis here but I doubt I'll get it since Reddit isn't the most forgiving place. Can I whine to y'all a bit?

I'm feeling super salty today. My anger and envy are disrupting my ability to work. I know need to be counting my blessings that I have my meager $22/hr job and health insurance and I really should just be a grown up and deal with my feelings to be considerate of the so many who have been laid off.

In spite of this, I am feeling so envious today that all of a sudden seemingly everyone in my life has all kinds of free time to exercise for 5 hours in the middle of the day and garden and/or just be a jag off. I have friends at the university right now who are being paid to do absolutely nothing and are living it up in the gorgeous weather we are having. 

Meanwhile, My own personal work is expounding but my pay and my hours will not. My boss is a classic top-of-the-totem-pole old school full professor at a huge R1 with enough power to frequently buy herself out of teaching which she has done this semester. I'm her research assistant and she's also my project supervisor. I'm DESPERATELY trying to just fucking write the last chapter of my already totally massive SEVEN CHAPTER quant/qual diss so I can graduate. 

Suddenly my duties are multiple because my boss can't see me working with her eyeballs and I think she's piling on the work and adding unrealistic deadlines just to ensure I stay busy. She's treating email like instant messenger and if I don't answer emails, she calls my personal cell phone.  I think it's just to try and control my behavior. I am at my computer from 8-7 and take a small break for dinner and go right back to the computer. The blurring of home/work is really wearing on me and it's only been a week. 

This blows so much ass. I haven't had time to work on my diss since we shifted to online work and I am starting to panic I'm not going to finish this semester. My supervisor ignores my diss related emails but is constantly sending work tasks. 

My partner is also defending his diss next week via zoom and is just happy as a pig in shit. He went on a 2 hour bike ride today while I put together charts and graphs and wrote a fucking lit review. I'm super supportive to him about his diss defense outwardly and have been this whole entire time, but inside I feel nothing but jealousy that he's free. 

I closed all the blinds and draperies and blocked out all the sunshine yesterday because I didn't want to see the gorgeous weather. My partner accused me of being mental and asked what the fuck was wrong with me. I just couldn't take seeing all the families and couples just out and about having fun and walking dogs and living actual life while I did yet another menial bullshit task that was cognitively intensive enough that I couldn't listen to a podcast or something while I worked but boring enough that staying focused was major challenge. 

I hate this, I really really hate this, and I am looking for catharsis. Do any of you feel the same way? How the hell am I going to make it through a few months of this? How the fuck can I walk the line with my professor? If I don't get the work done I'm terrified the diss will continue to be ignored.",1,2020-03-24 22:02:20

My dissertation has just been approved and I can not be more relieved. I am not relieved because of impostor syndrome or because the work load was too high. I am relieved that I never have to meaningfully interact with my advisor again unless I decide to. I can go into industry, and none of my future success requires further actions or approval from my advisor who is so prone to inaction and the inability to effectively communicate.

I am in a highly theoretical STEM field, where the individual research interests of professors are so distinct it is difficult to get good guidance from other committee members. Additionally, the barrier to entry is quite high and it is not common to complete publications in this field without heavy guidance.

During my PhD studies, I developed severe anxiety regarding meeting deadlines and the ability to control my own success. It was very frequent that meetings would be canceled at the last moment. My advisor was full of excuses, and as legitimate as they may be, did not offer sincere apologies. There are long periods where I make attempts for communication, by email, messaging, and phone call, with little or no response. There are empty promises of reading my work or doing a small task by a certain date, which are not met and when not met not addressed with an apology or request for more time, but rather a slew of excuses of being laden with administrative and personal affairs.

I have had many mental breakdowns during my PhD. These stem from politely pushing him to take action, and repeatedly being ignored or given false promises of completing said action. The inability for my polite actions to result in him taking necessary action for my success is the root of these breakdowns and anxiety. At times I have shared these ailments with my advisor, however this hasn't changed his behavior, perhaps superficially for a short amount of time, but the pattern reemerges shortly after.

I am free now, but it is my true belief that inaction and inability to effectively communicate, especially when aware of a student's declining mental health, is abusive. This realization was gradual, I perhaps only realized I felt this way 4 years in. I did not speak out because I was afraid that it would waste my years of work. Once I have degree in hand, I will no longer afraid of speaking out (I am not afraid of not having his reference, I am not confident in his ability to write a good reference in a timely manner, and I have other references.). I have talked to other students in my research group, and we all share some notion of this decline in mental health. I want my actions to help them, and I understand that these feelings may not be completely localized to this one advisor and may be a more common phenomena in academia.

I do not want to defame. My feeling is my advisor is experiencing mental health decline himself. I do think that professors, as people of power, have the responsibility to be good advisors and not directly cause mental health decline. I want to reach out to the department, but I do not know how to effectively incite change. I do not want to complain. I want to create change. First I want to create change for my former peers who are suffering the inaction of my advisor. If successful, a general method is preferred that can be applied in various departments. I want to start by inciting reform to increase the accountability of problem professors to communicate regularly and allow students to control their success to a larger degree.

I have thought about writing letters to the department chair and graduate student general advisor, and I think that is the first step. I was wondering if any of you have suggestions, or have had success creating localized reform within a department before. This will certainly not be easy, however your suggestions are very much appreciated.",1,2020-06-05 00:25:34

ivnyg6,oONAVYOo,t2_83ywimcn,Letter to the editor:,"Letter to the Editor

I am in my eighth year of teaching. I am a NBCT and hold a Master’s degree in educational leadership. I am of the generation that is comfortable with educational technology. In my undergrad program, I even had a semester-long course on teaching with technology. Yet here we are, six months into a devastating pandemic and I still feel like I’m reinventing the wheel. I have all of the tools and training one would think is necessary to make the pivot to distance learning seamless. So why is it that I am sleeping less, working more, and getting less than desired results?

Parents tell us everything that is on their minds  but it feels like I’m chasing the unattainable. I require too much and not enough at the same time. I’m too strict and too forgiving. My curriculum is simultaneously rigorous and easy. I can’t make everyone happy and they aren’t afraid to communicate their displeasure with how I do my job. 

Our administrators and OSPI tells us we need to consider the mental health of our students and be as forgiving as possible. Our motto is “do no harm,” and yet no one is talking openly about what this is doing to teachers. Why doesn’t that motto extend to those who are in the trenches, doing the hard work that you’re asking us to carry out? We have directives and initiatives but we are the ones receiving harsh parent emails. As a professional, I should not be degraded by parents who have no problem critiquing my abilities or personality. 

Our community members host rallies and protest. They claim they are concerned about the long term effects that school closures will have on children, but they’re not taking in the full issue. What about the long term effects of attending the funerals of your friends and teachers? These people claim to use their professional expertise to know what is best in this pandemic but as I see it, unless you are an epidemiologist or a public health professional with a speciality in disease transmission, you do not have a leg to stand on. I am a highly trained teacher but I don’t claim to have the same skill set as a law professor. Just because we’re in similar fields does not mean we have the same experience and expertise. 

I am afraid to speak up. I am afraid to tell coworkers that I don’t trust them. I am afraid to say that I do not feel comfortable returning to the classroom until there is a vaccine AND students and staff have been vaccinated. I am already very aware of the fact that I don’t fit in with the ideology of the community I teach in, nor would I change that. My values come from my personal experiences just as much as anyone else’s. However, the way we talk about COVID has spiraled into something so intense and so negative that you will be berated for “buying into” public health considerations. 

We are forcing teachers to choose between their vocation and their health. It shouldn’t be that simple. Ask anyone who knows me and they will tell you that teaching is who I am. My profession is my identity. I take pride in what I do every step of the way. I miss my classroom that I have spent years building into a warm, welcoming, safe place for students. I miss my students and the joy they bring into class each day. I hate staring at screens all day but you know what I would hate more? Not getting to see each and every one of my students graduate because they didn’t survive. Not being able to have the honor of writing college letters of recommendation or being a job application reference. I shouldn’t have to attend the funerals of my students instead of their graduation celebrations. 

There’s too much at stake to say that we just need to reopen schools. It’s not that simple. There is so much that is out of our control right now, so why aren’t we focusing on what we can do? Why is it a political issue instead of just being the right thing? Since when is kindness and compassion for the potential suffering of others not worth being uncomfortable temporarily? Instead of complaining, we need to make a dramatic shift of our focus as teachers or parents. School is a place. Education is still happening. We can take away the pressures and problems of the education system now. Parents need to be more actively involved in their children’s education. That isn’t the fault of teachers. That is how it should have been all along. 

No one else will speak for me. I did not ask you to speak on my behalf. I see where you are coming from. At the same time, I am holding fast to my belief that this pandemic will not improve until every single person views prevention measures like wearing a mask properly and social distancing as their responsibility and duty to themself and others. Do not dismiss this as part of the liberal agenda; it isn’t. Do not buy into the false belief that a building opening is more important than public health. Just because someone screams loudly on a Facebook video does not make them right.",1,2020-09-19 07:20:12
ivie3k,qry123456789,t2_858umnvu,I was told to post this here.," 

Preface: This is just my experience, I am in no way speaking on the state of History education as a whole, again this is just my experience. 

I came to college with the goal of studying Mechanical Engineering while also broadening my horizons, as I have interests in Philosophy and History. I know many people like to shit on a liberal arts education and understandably so -Colleges (especially the one I currently attend) seem to use this idea to justify making students spend large amounts of money on classes that are plain terrible. One example would be the required UNV 101 class that is essentially a History of the University / Diversity Training class, taught by a prof who had no motivation- but I had a relatively naive idea that I could go to University and come out not just an engineer, but a renaissance man with knowledge in a variety of subjects. One way I choose to make this more of a reality was to take a history minor. I was especially looking forward to the discussion sections where students debate interpretations of historical documents.

While I always knew that academia was left-leaning, I was not ready for the white guilt guillotine in every single history class, and its damaging to both intellectual discourse and -as much as I wouldn't like to admit it- mental health. I come in to my History of Both World Wars class, and instead of lecturing about the wars themselves, I'm subjected to an hour and a half long lecture -every class- on how the wars and countries involved negatively affected different ethnic minorities around the world. Now, its not that I'm against learning about minority perspectives, in fact I think it's super interesting to learn about the wide reach of these wars and the lesser known stories of how it affected people. But in a class branded as History of Both World Wars, It was frustrating to A) not dive into much detail about the world wars themselves and B) Learn about the entire world war era thought the lens of tyranny and imperial subjugation, when it seems there are many more economic and social issues to consider as well. The discussion sections were even worse. I had hoped that this would be a time to engage in debate and hear out other perspectives. Instead I sat though an hour long echo chamber in which any differing interpretation was shut down and sometimes punished with poor discussion grades. I very quickly learned that the way to success was to parrot the professor, get the A, and GTFO.

After taking three different history classes, each being very similar in political bias, I finally gave up on the History Department. I understand the want to express historically underrepresented perspectives, but the pendulum has swung a little too far for my liking. I recently changed my minor to mathematics as it's pretty difficult to segue from multi-variable calculus to racial injustice.

This is a sentiment I often hear among other engineering majors. They wish to move away from the uber-technical classes of engineering and broaden their horizons, but end up coming right back because the bull shit levels in other classes are too high. I read a decent amount on my own, so I don't feel like I'm missing out on the content, but I do wish I could have the experience of a legit civil debate in my classes.",1,2020-09-19 00:44:57
iveeqj,01831310,t2_3xdmwa7q,Fast tracked in my program — 7ish months to complete dissertation,"Hi everyone,

Looking for some advice on how to be as efficient as possible. I am in a 3-""ish"" year phd program. We are funded for three years with optional fourth year funding. I am an RA on a 5-year grant, so I expected to have two more years of funding after this year. My advisor is not pleased with my lack of productivity since C-19. We are in the US, I have a small child, and I am high risk so my toddler cannot attend daycare. 

I told my PI that an optional, extra research project they asked me to be on was becoming much more than I expected because it was more than they described (i.e., ""you will have third authorship in exchange for data collection"" was actually doing all of the pre-data collection prep, data collection, data cleaning, participant interaction, etc. including hashing out study ideas). 

My PI then said that if I am going to turn down research opportunities, I need to graduate in May so a first-year student can be recruited and given my RA position for two years. I have not even started my dissertation (three-paper option). My PI did not know that I needed 12 credits for dissertation so she gave me less than one week to complete my second qualifying paper (which was barely drafted), then switched some of my credits this semester to dissertation credits. 

This is all fine because the world is a mess anyways. I can't go get a job because my son is home and working remotely clearly isn't as productive as it should be. My question is really...

how do I get this done?! 

I want to create a very detailed timeline so I don't miss anything. I will have 3, sometimes 4, working days per week. For mental health purposes, I need to go be active one of my days where I am not parenting. 

Thank you!",1,2020-09-18 20:56:18

jf9ekz,notebookhunter,t2_5ovwow4o,the culture of academia,"I'm a grad student, and I've been working in a particular STEM field for literally most of my life. It's fufilling or meaningful to me, but the culture surrounding academia has left me bitter and in despair. For example in the past I've experienced academic bullying and was gaslit about it. This doesn't seem to be a unique situation in my field. There were prominent new stories about similar occurences everywhere, and the perpetrators never faced any sorts of consequences whatsoever. The response by universities tends to be beaucratic, top-down, and protects the institute, the few professors at the top, and does not genuinely care about its students despite the incessant and somewhat for-show HR-managed awareness campaigns centred over frivolous morning teas and wellness seminars run by admin. Actual academic faculty don't often participate in or barely manage to conceal their impatience for these things. Even mentioning one's personal or emotional life, burnout or mental health is still seen as a weakness or moral failing and professionally taboo by many senior staff members. Students are often isolated and unsupported, and raising any issues even with research as students leaves you very vulnerable. At this stage with a student and their advisor is a enormous power imbalance, especially in my field due to its less collaborative structure. This seems fundamentally unjust. My current institute seems less dyfunctional than others I've been at, but postdocs I've talked to still see it as a huge issue compared to the rare (in their opinion) 'better-run' universities and have tried to advocate for change for some years but according to them it's a losing battle as it falls on deaf ears. These people often seem happy to leave academia and look for positions in industry, but I know there are other people like me who want to make it work but don't know how. How can we be expected to do amazing research when this is the context for our work? For anyone's who's figured out how to navigate or change these systems for the better - please let me know.",1,2020-10-21 09:05:44

iyyucm,tsunamiofspeed,t2_4ggex9yj,Final year mental health nursing literature review- research proposal help?!,"Hi everyone! Hope you’re all well 😊 
I’m going to hopefully keep this short and simple as my brain is frazzled from frantic researching and ultimately brain fog ha! Also, I’m sorry if I’m sounding patronizing, It is by no means supposed to, I’m explaining it like I’m talking to myself at this point ha!

One of our assignments is a 3,500 word unique literature review, specific to mental health nursing practice. I have to come up with a question/statement for my lit review to be based on and around. On Monday, I have to submit a research proposal form, included my proposed title, rationale, 8 journals.....
Anyway, I’m really struggling to get my proposed ‘title’ (question or statement) for the lit review nailed, and it’s really stressing me out. I don’t know whether it’s because I’m slightly overwhelmed with various things at the minute and it’s causing my brain to just go blank or I’m just down right confused about it all but I just can’t seem to come up with anything. 

I’m interested in the topic of comorbidities / dual diagnosis in mental health nursing and so far all I have managed to come up with is ‘The experiences of nurses when understanding and implementing care for clients with dual diagnosis’. I don’t know whether this is too broad etc, or even right at all. Ps, I’ve tried researching this topic, some journals come up about nurse experiences etc but not many, leading me to wonder if I should really change my title. 

Any help, advice, tips or guidance would be HUGELY appreciated, more than words would understand!

Yours truly, 
A very frazzled aspiring mental health nurse",1,2020-09-24 15:00:54
ixfqyy,tired_RA,t2_85hm4tkw,I had a meeting with my supervisor and an assistant professor where they took turns degrading my character and talking about how amazing my supervisor is.,"I'm not a grad student but I hoped this would resonate with other students. I'm currently working in a (dry) lab as a research assistant on a project.

**The ""conflict"" that lead to the meeting:**

I recently asked my supervisor whether I could use the data I was collecting for the project. The project had specific outcomes that needed to be delivered and I thought of an interesting idea outside of that and wanted to see if I could run with it. She told me that the data was not hers but the grant providers so I could not. She also would often mention using the data for her PhD project that she was trying to do part-time. Here's where I was confused and felt uncomfortable with. I was totally on board with contributing my ideas, thoughts and methodology design ideas for the project but I felt uncomfortable if it were to do with her PhD. I don't know what the rules or ethics are and I didn't want to overstep that boundary so I also asked for her to clear that up. She just told me that she got special permission from the grant provider to utilize the data for her project. Okay... that didn't really clear it up but I just told her that I would have appreciated being told at the beginning of the project so I knew where my role stood. I thought I could also contribute to the project in different ways but now I clearly knew that this was her project and for me to just help collect data.

That's when she got really upset. I really don't know why. In my opinion and from my perspective, at least I asked for clarification before going about doing my own thing. I had misunderstood my role and she cleared that up for me. However, she was upset and started saying how I hurt her by asking such a question, blaming her, and that after all she did for me she would have expected my gratitude and appreciation and that I was not showing it. I apologized, although I did not mean it, as I realized she tried to guilt trip me by talking about my coworker needing money for their children's education and how she worked so hard to get the funding to cover their pay.

**The meeting:**

So to make a long story short, two weeks later she calls me into a meeting with an assistant professor. We sat down and the conversation begins where she tells her side of the story. From her perspective I blamed her for not telling me information about the project. I acknowledged her feeling of hurt and said it was not my intention and that I was extremely sorry for what I did. Then the conversation turns into how amazing my supervisor is, providing funding for our team, getting grants, being so knowledgeable, taking care of everyone, how she was my mentor (self-proclaimed) and taking turns to say how much of a terrible person I was to not appreciate her and this opportunity I had at this lab and how I should not be trying to steal her data. How I should know my place as a research assistant and just collect data. Don't be over ambitious. Flatter people. Be more social and don't tarnish relationships. Other labs are a more abusive to their research staff, don't you know how lucky you are to be here, to have an amazing supervisor like her? She also said ""I don't care if you've had a bad childhood or bad whatever. You really need to fix how you treat other people."" To add insult to injury, while I was trying to convey my perspective and was trying to say that yes, I agree that I'm not great at verbalizing my thoughts, my supervisor interrupts me to say ""Yeah, I noticed. You never say sorry or thank you."".

What really upsets me is that this assistant professor only heard her side of the story, didn't bother to talk to me and basically ganged up on me together with my supervisor. I don't know why they made it so personal and attacked me personally. Had they told me that my behaviour was unacceptable and unprofessional then I would have been fine. I'm also shocked at how transactional everything is to her. I do this for you so you must be compliant. Don't complain or ask questions.

I really want to escape. My mental health has taken a nosedive. I feel worse than I have in a long time and am doing horrible things to myself that I don't want to talk about but you get the idea. I think I'll have to suck it up for another few months until I get the scholarship I need to go to grad school. I can't believe that there are people like this and people who support them. Thankfully I've recorded the whole conversation and will probably write up a transcript for safe keeping.",1,2020-09-22 03:28:00

I contacted an AI chatbot company that partners with researchers to no avail. I hoped to gain information that would subsequently facilitate a conversation with researchers and healthcare providers. I was told tome back if I have concrete connections to people who can directly advance projects. A local research university is affiliated with a large psychiatric division, mental health &amp; chemical dependency unit, as well as a behavioral technology center. I have communication, human research, research review, report, and grant writing experience, and I'm looking to apply &amp; further develop those skills. I want to promote good science and healthcare as well as network. How can I get involved with their work and promote incorporation of digital or AI tools? What value can I provide with my undergraduate research training - by helping with drafts, clerical, or logistical work? I know I can provide value, but I'm not sure how to achieve that. Researchers/clinicians have their contact information, interests/activities, and often CV displayed online. How can I use my skills, interests, and their public information to build connections and advance projects?

jqp1kt,Francescodepazzi,t2_4b1ikdjj,Should i even do masters ? Plz read the whole thing to understand why I’m having such a hard time deciding.,"Hello all, 

I’ll be graduating next sem and so I have to start thinking about whether I should do masters or not. My major is electrical engineering. I’m currently not in the mood of doing masters mainly cuz I am under the impression that having a masters degree doesn’t really matter in the real world and it just takes two years of your life. Also I’m the eldest son in the family and so I’m starting to feel this sense of responsibility such as getting a job and providing for my family cuz my dad might lose or retire from his job. I’m from a middle class family and I’m pretty sure we won’t last long if my dad doesn’t have a job. Also one of my younger bro’s will be starting college soon and so that’s gonna be expensive. Another reason is that I have a Bad impression of thesis based masters. I’m an undergraduate researcher at my uni and my research experience so far (around one year) hasn’t been the best and it’s mainly cuz my advisor treats me like shit and assumes that Ik everything, so yea I’ve had a pretty rough time with research. But some my friends tell me that this experience shouldn’t be a deciding factor. Anyhow I’ll have a few publications by the time i graduate. I’m a scholarship student at a university well known for its research and so since I don’t have enough money to pay for masters, I might end up doing  research based masters in my current uni (it’s free of charge) or I might end up going to another uni (also free charge) which is also known for its research. So really my only option is to go for a research based masters. In this sub I haven’t really come across anyone who’s had a good experience with research and I understand cuz I’ve had the same bs experience over the past one year. I actually just want this year to end so that my grant comes to an end. I seriously need a break from research as it has affected both my mental health and my grades. I’m not a smart student who can manage everything but I can work hard if something has to be done. So I have been working my ass off to manage both my research work and school work. I have been saving some money but I’m pretty sure it’s not enough to even pay one semester of college tuition. I also intend to use this money for my brother fees and i feel like it’s the right thing to do. So basically there are a lot of factors that will determine my decision. It would be really helpful if y’all can give me any advice on what u should do right now. 

Thx",1,2020-11-09 02:25:12
jjaxh6,Exact_Hall3915,t2_3t97x2cd,Returning after messy history?,"TL;DR: Was RA during undergrad in multiple labs. Mental illness/breakdown led to leaving. 
Returned this year. Embarrassed to interact with the department. What are my options? 

My undergrad was ok; in second year I managed to do independent studies and present at some conferences. Unfortunately, there was a falling out with a professor. I’d requested help with poster pick-up (which was dumb). I didn’t think it was much of a problem as she regularly told me to email her if I needed help or something. This was one request I’d made but most of the work was done by myself and a grad student. She was very busy so I tried to work as independently as possible throughout the semester so in my mind the request wasn’t a boundary violation. I received a scathing email from my professor indicating that my request was ridiculous/she’d have never done that as an undergrad. It sent me into a full day panic. To top it all off my computer program didn’t show me all of her poster edit suggestions so I received another scathing email. I bailed on a conference in the US after that. Things were tense and relationships declined. 

My mental health declined too (thanks to a series of unrelated unfortunate events) and I left the university. I was supposed to help co-author a paper (in a different lab) when my mental health tanked again to the point of psychosis. My supervisors and lab group were likely extremely disappointed and upset. No one knew what was happening (not even me). I tried my best but a) I might be too stupid to navigate academia and b) too mentally ill. 

Fast forward to the present: I’ve returned to finish my degree. Unfortunately I’m way too embarrassed to even interact with any faculty in the department. 

Do I have options? I have some work I’m credited for but no published work as an author and sadly no LoRs. I was so close to being set for grad school. Now I’m starting over much later. I’m concerned that my mental health issues are a sign I shouldn’t pursue anything beyond this B.Sc.",1,2020-10-27 21:57:49
kr0rj3,meldiwin,t2_3isfiwme,I feel lost!,"&amp;#x200B;

I had an academic tenured career in my home country, I got masters,  and promoted assistant lecturer at this at the time at my home country I lost my Mom, and Grandmother, I got sick, it was a dark time moreover, I did not enjoy the politics at my university, although students liked me so much and still even still ask me for recommendation letters. I will complete 30 in a few weeks, and it is shame to feel lost. I took the decision to leave everything behind since I developed C-PTSD, but I did not know when I travelled, I was in a bad mental health situation while doing the PhD (for maybe returning back to be a lecturer in my home country, however, I don't think that something I can even go to the place I had the worst memories).

Long story short, I did not get along with the supervisors I had, I had to move to another and another one, all of the choices were wrong, and maybe I wasn't lucky enough and I took decision out desparations.

However, I feel everything happen in our life of reason, I started a side-hustle since two years ago and unexpectedly made a success and I can call it now my passion and true call, however, I don't bring me money to leave the day job in academia.

This is side hustle boosted my mental health, confidence, while moving from program to another one for sake of better environment, I started to face bullying, complete ignorance, and isolation from the group, gaslighting, and few incidents and I even went to the ombudsman, she didnot help, the region is quite xenophobic although they seemed to be nice at the beginning (at the beginning).

Thanks to the side-hustle I have made a good network, I considered moving to something to my location, but there no funding to leave to another one and one of the struggle I will complete 30 (I am still single, but it is exhausting to move again at this age)

Honestly, I feel pain not because the work itself change, the environment is demoralizing to the extent I cannot describe but it makes me low energy because of this environment, I had threats against the side-hustle and clearly they did not like that I got attention in our field because of that side-hustle.

I am trying to make this side-hustle as profession but super challenging because there isno income and everyone in this side-hustle take years or maybe if I am lucky I can make it happen I dont know.

I love science, I was always top student, I had a career and now I feel I am in the middle of the now where I cannot return to my home country (I had nightmares and I cannot describe how this place hurted me so much) and here I feel lost.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried therapy for C-PTSD but it takes time, and I feel happy when I am doing that scientific side-hustle, and some thoughts tell me you have to be ashamed at the age losing what you have been doing at early twenties. I am crying, I hope you can understand me and give me advices whether I am doomed, I am just cannot push it harder.",1,2021-01-05 15:40:34
knggmy,Muted-Leg371,t2_8axu88j8,Trust No One Fully,"This is the best advice to give to any prospective grad student. I just successfully defended my dissertation at the #1 program in my field, and I trust everyone involved far less than I did when they pulled me in. I’m not even sure I’ll be heading in an academic direction at this point, even with the degree under my belt. My mental health is certainly far worse than it was when I entered the program, and my mentors somehow consider me a “success.”

Make your advisor earn your trust and push them away if that trust is broken. Only trust her or him for specific issues related to getting you to where you want to be. As a grad student, you work for your advisor and any good work you do reflects positively on that person. Your advisor will probably want you to do things that make them look great and do nothing for you.

Be really, really careful about this. Even if your advisor acts like your friend, you still have to be careful. They may steal your work, they may promise things they never deliver on, they may ignore your emails. Look out for yourself. Period.",1,2020-12-31 02:06:59

k5gvty,goldspotzingthing,t2_679eazh4,Leave of Absence rules,"I am a non-resident alien (H1B) based in the US working for a state university. I was on FMLA leave this semester (Fall 2020) and have applied for state disability insurance for an extension of my disability leave for the Spring semester too. I had to do this some years earlier albeit at that time my FMLA leave was in Spring and the state disability extended into the summer when no classes are held. That meant that effectively I was not able to teach only for one semester. My department head was extremely supportive and there were no problems at any stage of the process.

This time round though, there is a new department head who has been extremely hostile to me ever since they joined. While my FMLA went through for this Fall, it has now ended. I am currently awaiting the decision on my state disability insurance and there is every chance that they won't arrive at a decision by early Jan 2021 when school reopens. I want to take a Leave of Absence starting immediately or starting Jan 2021 without waiting for the state disability decision to arrive because I am medically not fit to resume my job. Here's what I want to know:

1. Can the university refuse the Leave of Absence even though my doctors have provided medical documents supporting the need to extend my leave?
2. How much clout does the department head have in this case? Do they have the  power to not approve or sign on any application for a Leave of Absence? Honestly, I have no faith in them or their support. I sent all my disability papers to HR and feel extremely uncomfortable to share any personal medical details with the department head. I assume that that information should be protected by HIPPA and they are outside their rights to press me on medical details. 
3. Is it possible to be on state disability while also on Leave of Absence? In other words, am I ineligible for state disability insurance money if I am on a Leave of Absence?
4. Is disability a valid reason to take a Leave of Absence?
5. I have contacted HR and they said they will consult their lawyers. Their lawyer has called and left a message on my phone. I don't have a personal lawyer and am not in a position healthwise to hunt a good lawyer for myself in such little time. Moreover, I live in a small obscure town and the major law firm works for the university. I also don't have anyone who can do all the running around and search for a lawyer on my behalf. I want to know what my rights are before I return the university's lawyer's call. Can I take a Leave of Absence and then see what happens with the state disability insurance? Can they fire me? In the past they hadn't but the boss was different.

As one can imagine, this is an extremely stressful situation for me. My family is based abroad and I need this job until I can find another one. Due to covid I am also unable to travel back to my country where the infection rates are exponentially rising. Such a situation is neither good for my mind nor health. Any ideas or help is genuinely appreciated. I must leave this job for sure but due to the intense mental strain and harassment I am just not lucrative enough for another university to hire me.

I spent hours going out of my way to make it easier for you to understand how to do it yet tou ignored my emails and my requests to follow through with certain tasks. When I finally spoke up and said I would like to have the first author because of my substantive contribution, your first rebuttal was that you need to have it for your PhD. That's not a valid reason. I stated the research ethics guideline and the only contributions you could attribute to for this were funding acquisition and administrative tasks. That's not enough. No, my ethical standards aren't ""too high"". I didn't even use the funding you got to do the research. It was all data that could be collected through the library resources.

I'm bringing this issue to my PI who also happens to be the head of the department. I'm sick and done with your constant harassment, threats, and how you go off on a tangent of how much you've done for the team. My mental health has taken a dive, I kept my mouth shut for a while but this is the line I draw. I want my ability to do independent research acknowledged.

Thank you and sorry for the rant!

Edit:

Talked to my PI. I wasn't able to fully detail the problem and situation because I was so flustered.  I explained how we were having authorship disputes and that I asked for first authorship because I had done the entirety of the work. The ultimate advice I got was 'don't try to burn bridges and relationships' and 'seniority matters'. I feel defeated and just used. I'm also in my early career stages. Is it because I'm not doing a PhD that I am less important, less in need or have less say than someone who is and older than I am? 

The bridge has already been burnt. There's no turning back. The passive-aggressive comments and nitpicking every aspect of my flaw in my personality... is that what I have to endure because of seniority? 

Sorry guys. I wish I had better news. But clearly, this is the culture and environment some of us are stuck in. You try to stand up for what are university and research mandated ethical standards. Ironic how we put so much effort into applying for IRBs.",133,2021-02-04 07:18:17

l2qe1r,RobertFrancisLCSW,t2_1buxpqk3,Schizophrenia resources for academic use,"If you are a distinguished Professor, or academian, of psychiatry or psychology, I want to share with you my materials on my first-person account of living with schizophrenia. I know some assign FPAs as required reading. My aspiration is for my books to be used in academia. I think both of my books are good for residents and/or students to read. I also have a free YouTube channel on schizophrenia. I cover different schizophrenia topics in brief 2 minute videos. Perhaps these videos may too have some classroom utility. Here are the further details. Ty for your time!

I would like to share, I wrote 2 books on living with, and overcoming, schizophrenia. I have lived with schizophrenia for 25+ years. I currently work as a post-masters mental health talk-therapist (a Licensed Clinical Social Worker-LCSW). My first book is titled “On Conquering Schizophrenia; From the Desk of a Therapist and Survivor”. My second book is titled “The Essential Schizophrenia Companion; With Foreword by Elyn R Saks, PhD, JD”. I write from the perspectives of both a provider and also someone with schizophrenia. Both are on Amazon. If you go to Amazon, you can read the editorial reviews on each.

if you are interested, I also have a free YouTube channel called “On Conquering Schizophrenia”. I do one video per day on various topics related to schizophrenia and I mix perspectives of a therapist and consumer. Here is the link for my channels welcome video.

kxhm1l,aritrop,t2_zrwid,Harassment as a former Indian PhD student in a Mathematics department in the USA.,"A shorter synopsis here (missing key incidents): [https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/155185/how-to-proceed-after-being-threatened-and-treated-poorly-by-university-faculty-a](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/155185/how-to-proceed-after-being-threatened-and-treated-poorly-by-university-faculty-a)

My(now deleted) long post on StackExchange from March of last year. Detailing a lot of garbage from our Math department; it's hard to get across the context in which these comments were made, and a couple of these could be deemed somewhat inoffensive here, but mostly the environment was such that even the couple of seemingly mild incidents mentioned here seemed extremely serious, compared to another PhD environment I had been in till 2016. Frankly, looking back, I wrote this in a very measured tone. The biggest trigger initially for me to want to make these things public was the constant frothing at the mouth ultra demeaning way in which a specific PhD student behaved with me from the very beginning(as mentioned later), and later began the same with other international students(who also felt worked up with far less interaction with him than me). However, a lot of further incidents kept happening even after thisna initial impulse to make things public.

The incidents from 2019 and earlier this year would all have been dealt with a lot better if the present head of the department didn't become seriously sick, and he remained the head of the department from earlier on. Another recently graduated student wrote to me on Messenger that ""The department is going to become even more racist if he is not here now"".

&amp;#x200B;

This behavior is mostly from Spring 2018 and then Fall 2019. These raised extremely serious safety concerns at that time, and an office to address this behavior did not even exist inside this university until 2019. When I did finally report this to the new office, they said they take it seriously, but then completely dismissed everything mentioned here. Prior to that the only place to report this was their HR department, and I faced a further round of harassment from them, upon reporting the Spring 2018 events. I'm an Indian PhD student.

Let's call the concerned person X. The chair is called Chair.

In Spring 2018 I was teaching a Calculus class and X was then the so called supervisor in these teaching matters; at one point I was grading undergrad exams in his office. On his office door is a newsclip of the professor who was viewed as a terrorist for doing math on the plane. The newsclip ended in self-reflection, concluding that the only thing 'we' fear more than immigrants is Math.

While grading, at one point X casually remarked that he was looking for his boarding pass. I casually remarked we should all be careful doing Math on a plane; when he very proudly told me 'no, I'm white'. I replied; 'well wasn't the guy in that incident also white'? then he smugly said as a putdown, 'yes, but he was Italian, I'm not Italian, I'll be fine’. There was another visiting postdoc well within earshot in the room with his back turned to us, as this was happening.

A few days later, I had been late for a few hours in finishing grading; something that literally always people are, including X (I also wasn't very pleased when on the prior evening, my advisor from back then needlessly insulted me in front of several other faculty members for coming to a dinner with a colloquium speaker, when I had no intention to really go there but for the fact that I thought he would expect me to be there). While no one else had an issue, one of X's minions, a fellow PhD student, came to my office and told me it's disgusting I was late and that he was shaking in anger as a result. I told him politely to leave and shut the door of my office. Upon hearing this, X came to my office seeming extremely bellicose, physically intimidated me and forced himself into my office, as if I was a criminal. I told him also to please get out of my office , after which he got out and went to chair's office and started complaining about me. No one was inconvenienced then because I was late for a few hours with grading, and every single time I have graded with people, one or more people have been late with grading.

After a midterm exam, X was asking opinions about how to grade a contentious question; one of his minions passionately said something to which X replied in a conciliatory tone ""I know you're from U Chicago and you think you know best, but I disagree""; I was right there and also tried getting a word in, and X looked at me with absolute detestation, suggesting you don't have a right to say anything here.

Earlier that day, I was hearing him talking down to a Chinese graduate student, telling him there's an American PhD student also in the room he would be invigilating in for the exam, and that student would take care of everything, and the Chinese student doesn't need to know any of the procedures for setting up the exam in the exam room.

During the proctoring, we had to add up some numbers for some reason and I was doing it in my head; X's minion was standing there and suddenly he lost it; started saying 'it's disgusting you guys can add stuff up so fast'; talking about some racist tropes he has in his head about Indians. This was said in a really loud and unpleasant tone. X was right there and heard everything but said nothing.

Afterwards as we were grading in the lounge, as a lot of people were joking around I facetiously remarked that I might comment in an Indian student's exam in an Indian language; which of course I was not going to do. X got triggered and became serious and cooked up a story of some Chinese students and postdocs talking in Chinese in the corridors that apparently made so many people suspicious that there were serious complaints. This was said in a room full of graduate students, many of them Chinese, who interact in Chinese between themselves and with other Chinese faculty or postdocs and no one that I knew of found anything wrong in it. At another time, he told me in our lounge when others were present, that our university might be a nice place, but there is a Jewish clique, and then there is a Chinese clique and the whole environment is very divided. At another time, in our graduate lounge with a lot of people present, when I was casually remarking, after many such casual remarks by American students there, that the traffic here in Boston reminds me of India sometimes, X snapped and very threateningly told me: don’t B-S me, I’ve seen so and so movie, I know what traffic in India is like. Although the “very threatening” bit was so commonplace that it kind of feels strange to point that out.

As is the norm, X would ask for questions from graduate student instructors, in order to make the final list of exam questions. Not a single one of my questions were used in the two midterms, although a couple were used in the final exam if I recall. I found it unacceptable that none of these questions had been used in the midterms; I know of at least one other Indian phd student whose questions had not been used either, and he was OK with it; but I was not, with the amount of time spent in making the questions.

Surprisingly X once suddenly forced himself into my office last Fall, upon hearing some complaint from a recently graduated student about such issues, probably something about my general countenance struck a chord with him and compelled him to rush in to check if there was more pent up trouble further down the road, and I politely tried ending the conversation, because it was not productive. He concluded in solidarity, saying how he too was very wary when he first came here as a PhD student, since he was scared he would have to learn Hebrew, because of a large Jewish population here.

I've lost count of how many times one PhD student that Xhangs out with has said outrageous things in front of me, often directed at me; repeatedly saying how 'there are some typical Indians around here', that 'Indians are taking over' (even though there have only been 3 or 4 Indian students at a time in our program, and for the last 4 years there have been no Indian PhD students here) and how 'it's so funny there is great color consciousness in India since you guys are all brown'. Often these things were said in front of many other people, and if I counted individual instances, probably such comments were uttered a few dozen times in my presence. At one other time, in front of me and another Indian student who had mentioned that the Supreme Court judges in India are not known expressly as liberal and conservative partisans as is the case in the US, this student began to openly say in a disparaging tone that the judges in India would be no good anyway, in comparison to the US.

In the very beginning, in front of several other graduate students, he would be talking about a specific slur against Jews, that I didn’t know about earlier, in the tone that he was just curious about it but not using it himself, but kept using it repeatedly in front of several people. There was no Jewish person present when he kept on saying this.

At first I didn't think much of it, and even thought some of his comments about Indians was intended to be amusing which I shouldn't have; but upon talking with him a little more it was clear he was saying all these things not as a joke but meant everything. The worst situation was last Fall when during a mandatory meeting a couple of PhD students including me brought up some issues regarding transportation and mental health issues among undergrads, and after it ended, this PhD student in front of everyone else began to loudly say 'how funny it is how he always complains, it was so funny' and then came to my office and still kept insulting me to my face, ignoring the fact that there was another American PhD student who was raising far more issues than me .

There's also another PhD student X hangs out with all the time, who would froth at the mouth in my presence in the beginning, and in the presence of a few other international students; and probably it was the worst and most prolonged dehumanizing behavior I've faced from anyone younger than me, with him talking with me (and also a few other international PhD students a bit later) in a vile and threatening manner like we are lepers; however this person was careful not to utter slurs. I’ve spoken to a couple of other international students and they have also felt unnerved by him for prolonged periods, but I should emphasize this began the earliest with me and he was in the same year as me. Regarding him, I was speaking with another international PhD student, who told me that if someone behaved like that in his home country with him, he would punch him in the face. And this international student had to interact with him far far less than I had to. If it was in my own country, I would probably not punch him, but call the Police dozens of times.

This student became a favorite of one of our teaching coordinators, this teaching coordinator is someone we had no option to avoid and who would harass some of us on the simplest of pretexts. Another Indian PhD student remarked in front of me and someone else, that “the treatment of international students by this teaching coordinator is extremely poor”. I happened to mention this to another Indian PhD student here who was seriously harassed by this teaching coordinator and who had been documenting that harassment. Then the former Indian PhD student came to know about it, and sensing he might get into unnecessary trouble with this being added to the pantheon of comments and complaints, began to aggressively say “I never said such a thing”. Another international PhD student who graduated and got a postdoc job elsewhere called me after the completion of his first semester there; he had taught and graded along with PhD students in his new place and said it was refreshing and cathartic not to get harassed about simple matters in grading like he had been here. I have personally been talked to in a needlessly condescending way about minor (non)issues in grading, and in the beginning asked to regrade things for the flimsiest of (garbage) reasons. It is tiring to even talk about the nuisance created by this person in simple matters of grading; generally when I have graded with other faculty members here or at my previous university, things have been far more normal. Both her and X, after working with us for more than a year and apparently claiming to know us well, called me by another Indian PhD student’s name, which particularly in the US is considered very bad form.

There is yet another former PhD student here who I have seen behave in a very aggressive and condescending manner with other international students and I’ve talked with other international students about it. I myself always said hi and hello like is the custom in the US, and very rarely heard any hi or hello in return, and on one instance, as I was passing him by in the corridor, this PhD student looked at me in an extremely aggressive and ugly way, which would unnerve and make anyone feel unsafe, and if something like this happened on the streets you would move away as quickly as possible from there.

Coming to the incidents of Fall 2019, let's call the person Y, a PhD student whose desk was right next to mine in the office. Starting in September 2019, he would repeatedly put his boot on a chair pointing straight at me, just a couple of feet away from where I would be sitting and working, and when I asked him to stop this, he would do so and then resume a few days later, and then say I purposefully moved in the view of his feet so I could claim that his feet were pointing towards me. (I had earlier tried to make eye contact suggesting that this is really very poor, with me having to see the underside of his boots from a couple of feet away, but he didn’t respond to my very polite non-verbal cues.) Then a few days later, he would say in a very overbearing tone that we should now look at the configuration of the chairs so he could explain to me how his feet were not pointing towards me; this is after the chairs had all been moved around within the intervening days. Hearing all of this, I had told him 'I have work to do and don't want to engage your third rate ilk'; which is not a nice thing to say, but under the circumstances seemed quite necessary. Afterwards Y saw me in the corridor and came eyeball to eyeball, with an extremely threatening body language, standing inches from me, saying in a theatrical way, ""don't you ever disrespect me ever again"", because apparently that was his sole privilege.

After this he began keeping his bag on a chair very close to my desk and far from his desk, in some kind of passive aggressive show of force. I took a picture of this and showed our Director of graduate studies, let's call him Z, and he knew of the previous incident, and he asked me not to get worked up over it, and that he 'noted' it. I said it's better to change offices for me; and this is done informally by grad students all the time. However, Z personally intervened and said that's not necessary, and we should get along. This might have been due to a personal dislike of Z towards me. I was always polite with him but didn't think the world of him to take his Combinatorics 1 class, but took a Combinatorics 2 class taught by a prodigious postdoc in the department.( It turns out I got two papers on my own from that Combinatorics 2 class, one of which now got a favorable review from a top Combinatorics journal.)

Z was miffed, and told another faculty member (as narrated by this other faculty member to me) how I can at all do research in Combinatorics (doing Combinatorics research was never my plan anyway) if I didn't take his Combinatorics 1 class and in turn this faculty member relayed this to me. At that time, I met with Z and he told me that one of the aforementioned PhD students who said things like “you f—ing Indians” to me and behaved in offensive ways dozens of other times, was just “special”, and I should just learn to live with it. Then Z, being from a Western European country, told me in solidarity, after having seen the list of alleged incidents, that “Americans don’t dress well”, and there are other similar kinds of general problems we always deal with.

I’m not sure exactly and would hope they both did the right thing by asking this other graduate student to leave when they were talking about me, but Z and this faculty member were both saying condescending things about me, as this other faculty member himself told me coming out of the office they were speaking in. I was then asked to go to this office a minute later to speak with Z, and saw this other PhD student sitting in that office and it seemed like he was grading exams for a while. I would hope the PhD student was asked to leave for the time when these two faculty members were disparaging me.

On November 14 2019, as I was just entering the office in a bit of a hurry, and Y was coming out coincidentally at the very same moment, I did my best to move sideways, and there was a huge amount of room for him to move out, he deliberately rammed his shoulder into me, and kept ramming it into my body for a good few seconds. This now got into the territory of physical assault; and I immediately screamed about this, and a seminar was going on, and people got startled and closed the door.

There were no direct eyewitnesses to this. Later Z(grad advising head) told me that Y talked with him and that Y was minding his own business and that I started screaming at him unreasonably. Then Z said that if I complained about this to the Campus police, then I would probably get expelled. To the credit of the chair of the department, he intervened and said no one can get expelled like this.

Z, the graduate advising head, also looked at documentation which listed comments by X about Italians, Jews, Chinese, Indians, and documentation of all the bellicose attitude from him, and then declared that none of this is offensive(he wrote this in an email that is with me). Then he told me I should have just let it go when another PhD student started saying stuff beginning with “you fucking Indians” or something very similar, and when this was said in front of the teaching faculty member X, instead of getting further appalled, I should have reasoned with X.

It is sometimes next to impossible to function properly in this kind of environment; and especially when things can get into the territory of physical assault so quickly and a faculty member with an axe to grind in this manner could step in. Compared to the previous graduate program I had been in, this was just a casually toxic environment; things like a graduate student who ordered a book through Amazon from India because it was cheaper and then in front of everyone began mocking what apparently was (to him) the poor presentation of the book as it arrived, or when in a nearby university during an AMS meeting an Indian mathematician with a bit heavy accent was giving a talk, a graduate student from our department began to openly laugh at the accent, looking at me like why I didn’t also laugh at that accent; when all the few dozen other people in the room were being serious with the talk (and some attendees seemed to have been old friends and acquaintances of this Indian mathematician).

There’s another faculty member here who says loudly to another PhD student, both taking it in a joking manner apparently, “don’t steal my f%$#ing car, you Albanians steal cars”, and the PhD student finds it funny and goes around telling people how funny this is. I was in the office of this faculty member when he said this; interrupting what I was trying to discuss with him. At another time, this faculty member said to his Complex Analysis class, “we have to kill the poles in the denominator”, then paused, and then quipping “let’s not talk about WW2 now”. Here, poles is a mathematical term, and Poles also is apparently a reference to Polish people.

The question is, how do I tie these incidents together with the incidents from the other post, and mention how it can sometimes be very difficult to function in such an environment, and that they should immediately stop threats of expulsion? To the immense credit of the department, I now have a new office which is peaceful. However, right in the next office is a guy who has unnerved many of the legal aliens in the department with his weird and threatening body language and behavior.

Edit: I see that some people are saying how putting your feet up is not a big deal in the US. I've seen this among officemates before, some good friends of mine, and it was perfectly fine. In all those cases, they were not pointing their feet squarely at me with such an obviously poor body language, and they were polite enough that if I would tell them I found it disrespectful, they would be mindful of that. In this instance, I told this person to stop, yet he started doing the same thing after a few days, having the audacity to say I purposefully moved in view of his feet to claim this; as if I have nothing else to do. Hence my response was a necessity.

Update: Y has currently graduated and has been taken in as an instructor within our department and is apparently going to be teaching graduate courses. The other graduate student who used racial slurs against me was called special by Z and Z told me he deserves our understanding. At the same time, I’ve been constantly harassed and hounded by the university administration and threatened by their lawyers. This of course is explained by the fact that after the Office of Diversity and HR told me everything is fine, I asked them in return how they would like it if I made these things public knowledge.

Part3:

I'm an Indian Mathematics PhD student somewhere in the US, and have been working with a faculty member affiliated to a university near mine, from the beginning of 2019. At the end of November 2019, I completed the proof of a problem given to me, under the so called guidance of this faculty member, although he had very little to do with it for a long time, except one contribution in the end, which was commendable. Once he came up with this alternate way to prove what I had already proved, he immediately began to call my work rubbish, and said, you will only write my argument in your thesis. Towards the end, I implored him to write the part that he thinks he is correct in, since it was going to be a joint paper, but he said that no, I must rewrite things and incorporate his idea and do the rewriting even when it was going to be a joint paper.

An update to this is that the paper was quite late in being written by me; months after it should have already been written. I asked my advisor then to become a co-author but then surprisingly he refused; this is two months after I had stopped speaking with him. Recently the paper was peer reviewed by a very reputed journal and the referee said the arguments are all deemed correct.

He began to continuously berate and belittle everything I have done, and grew extremely hysterical when I suggested a similar but different result was also within reach, which he didn't think possible. We were once sitting in a casual eatery, and I was calmly trying to explain some arguments, and he seemed extremely agitated, talking over me, calling the arguments wrong, but then trying to explain the same thing to me, as if it was his argument.

I would have written up the project and sent for publication, but the extremely hostile attitude of this person stopped me from doing that. After mid-December, he again contacted me in the middle of January, and he expected me to regurgitate all the proofs to him again and again till the middle of March and do nothing else in that time with him. He would condescendingly tell me what according to him is right and what is wrong, in this time interval.

It's unbelievable that he would prevent me from writing down the next result which he believed was not possible, but which would take an hour to decide on, with a receptive person. I found this an unacceptable waste of my time, and also if I had to look for jobs and graduate in 2021, this was an unacceptable delay in sending the paper to a journal, although realistically the plan was to graduate in 2022.

I'm appalled by this kind of hostile attitude on a project where the techniques are so elementary, essentially nothing more than the pigeonhole principle is used, although things become a bit complicated. I would often tell him I have certain things figured out, and don't have to write it out since it is simple enough; and he would say OK; then next week he would completely berate me saying you know nothing about this. Perhaps not accustomed to working with someone who he feels superior to, that too from India, who did things much quicker than he anticipated.

I had been speaking with a noted emeritus faculty member here, who is a renowned Combinatorialist, and telling him what was going on, and he sounded genuinely sorry for me in this situation but told me he was powerless to do anything about it. He was the only person who sounded genuinely sympathetic in this situation, when I wrote to him saying, to paraphrase, “having been in another US university, I didn’t expect this kind of ethnocentrism to be propped up like this”. I also sent a futile email to Z about what was happening, who only replied writing that my then advisor would have solved the problem even if it was not for me. In a later correspondence, Z said that there was enough reasons to expel me on academic grounds.

Upon reporting this behavior in December 2019 to the department, I immediately began to get threats of expulsion. This is at the time when I had two publishable projects near completion. For my own good, I had to think to try to work with someone else, and I tried to talk with a faculty member about a particular problem in his area of expertise that I did substantial reading on and that I found interesting and wanted to work on. He completely ignored me. Despite this, during those times, at least 4 to 5 times I heard over a span of three months that my funding should get withdrawn and that the department would not be able to keep me.

The faculty member who I was once again interested in working with, had himself started advising an Indian student who was in his 4th year, in Spring 2018, although this student didn't have any completed projects till then. Our department is such that at least five people have changed advisors in their 4th year (at any single point we have &lt;30 PhD students) in the recent past, but none of them were threatened like me; and I doubt any of them could probably also objectively defend a thesis in their 4th year, before switching advisors, if they had to. Now I'm working with another mathematician in a nearby university, and in the process I have had to change to another area of research this late, which is not a great thing.

Other incidents:

(i)The shoulder bumper alleging that a faculty member told him he wouldn’t get admitted if not for his white sounding name, him being Asian American.(Also this faculty member allegedly jokes around Chinese undergrads how like him they can't pronounce certain letters of the alphabet) Then an Indian student alleging that the shoulder bumper told him he shouldn’t be allowed to teach because of what he deemed his terrible accent, and the Indian student actually claiming in writing in an email that he had to really control himself in the past from getting physical with the shoulder bumper due to his behavior.",1,2021-01-14 23:24:09

m3g4zi,Daniellereadit,t2_2nww7nfz,Looking for an expert to give talk on mental health in academia,"Hi all,

I work as a PhD student in a relatively big academic science institute in Europe, focusing on biology and chemistry. As member of the diversity and inclusion committee I am looking into organising some activities during the mental health awareness week (10-16 May). We were thinking about (virtually) hosting a speaker/therapist who could give a talk about mental health issues in academia. Preferably someone who can give some advice to PhD's and postdocs, but also to PIs about maybe recognizing signals from their students. As I think working in academia comes with a specific set of struggles and problems, familiarity with academia is an important requirement. Does anyone have any experience with such a person/talk? Or do you have other suggestions about how to reduce the stigma on mental health issues in beta science institutes.

I'm not sure if this is the right community for this/if this question is allowed here. Apologies if it's not, suggestions for alternative subreddits are welcome!

Thanks a lot!",1,2021-03-12 12:02:11
lrf7ez,DrSarahBellum,t2_6ost2wll,How to break away from PhD advisor?,"I'm days away from submitting my PhD thesis and have started applying for postdoc positions. My experience with this PhD has been extremely difficult and has exacerbated my mental health issues due to extreme lack of support/supervision/funding allocation/6+ month delayed thesis submission due to ignored emails. I've managed to reach what I hope is the end, I'm still here, and at this point I just need the title for a chance at a fresh start. 

My advisor suggested that I would be a good fit to work with a new PI in a lab in a nearby city. I liked the subject area and could see how I could incorporate my own research interests into their project idea, so I agreed to chat. I started drafting up a postdoctoral grant application and my ideas were being received enthusiastically. However, whether through miscommunication or the usual complete lack of communication, my advisor has now inserted himself into the arrangement and decided that I would spend half my time in my PhD lab, and half in the new lab, with the majority of the project focused on his subject area, and with the thumbs up from the other PI. 

I don't want to pursue this application anymore as what I really want is a fresh start, and this isn't one. However, others who have ""burned"" my advisor have faced huge delays to thesis submission, and have gained terrible reputations within our department. My thesis submission still relies on approval from my advisor and I will inevitably need him as a reference for my next job. 

TLDR: How do I tell my advisor I am no longer interested in pursuing the draft grant application and just want my thesis submitted without burning the bridge completely?",15,2021-02-24 15:15:47

I  accepted a funded PhD offer in a scientific field back in April. This summer, my mental health has been declining, in part because of anxiety about graduate school and because I no longer think the program is right for me. I am due to begin in mid-August. Is it ok for me to back out of  my offer? Does this count as dropping out, and what are the lasting  ramifications? Would I be able to re-use my undergraduate references when I reapply to schools in a year or two? I already signed a lease for an apartment, so this would  cost me a lot of money.

e2b970,Movladi_M,t2_4ougwx2x,Salvaging something out of failed life sciences career?,"Greetings, 

I would like to ask for some feedback on whether it is possible to salvage anything out of my “career” in life sciences. It is quite difficult  to write calmly about my experiences, nonetheless, I will try to stay away from my grievances and emotions. 

Originally, I come from the ex-USSR country. I’ve got my Masters degree (biology) then moved to Germany into one of their “International Life Sciences PhD programs”. It was indeed very diverse and international, so it was very good for improving my English skills in writing, speaking, presenting – you name it (still, not as good as an English-speaking country would be). However, my experience turned out to be very frustrating. Shortly after starting in the lab, I noticed that PhD students and postdocs were treated badly, people were unhappy (but tried to hide it). A sort of “scientific gambling” was running at that place – i.e. there were close to 30 people in the lab at the peak, which were divided between 5 totally different projects, all running in parallel under same PI. Essentially, if anyone found something worthy of “Nature” than it had a chance to be published. If not, the PI didn’t bother at all. More career-minded postdocs left the place by themselves promptly, realizing that they were not able to move their career to the next level. More relaxed people that didn’t care about career and were on good terms with PI, stayed for 5 years and more, achieving very little in terms of measurable output. PhD students were hurt particularly bad, as many of them had to defend without publications. There was no meaningful supervision whatsoever, no “Plan B” etc. recommendations were also a huge problem – the PI simply didn’t bother to write them and didn’t mind writing nasty recommendations for people that he disliked personally. Essentially, my project didn’t produce any meaningful results. Initially the project looked O.k., but after working for some time, I clearly understood that it is a junk! I have asked (both PI privately and raised my concerns at the theses committee) for a side-project, for a parallel project – for anything that could yield a paper! Neither PI, not the thesis committee supported me. At the end, I defended my thesis and got a Ph.D., but it costed me a lot of excruciating mental pain, I didn’t have publications and could not count for any support (even a recommendation letter) from my PI. I managed to find a position of a postdoc with a young PI, who turned out to be a “slave driver”. Essentially, I had to work 60 to 70 hr a week for a salary of a janitor at the same university. I wouldn’t complain about money, if the work yielded anything. Besides my main project (which would be O.k, but could not be published within reasonable time), I worked as a technician for collaborators. The PI wanted his name in the authors list (to boost his publication record), so he “schmoozed” different collaborators and “slaved out” his people to do menial work for their research. The stream of these “collaborations” never stopped. True, I am “the first author” of a book chapter (a useless review, in essence) and 7 or 8 other papers with my name as 4th, 5th or 6th author (which is again pretty useless). After considering all pros and cons, I left for the first job I could find. It was not worth to pull 60-hr weeks, for salary of a janitor at the third-rate university. If any of these conditions were different, I would have stayed and tried to publish a paper as a first author. Now you can understand from where I am coming. 

At present, I work as a project manager (I am a Canadian citizen now). I am reasonably satisfied with my present job, only (and significant) downside – it is a “soft” money position (no union, no safeguards). This worries me because 1) I am single and do not have a support network of any sort; 2) I am tired of relocating and would ultimately like to settle down and 3) “academia” took a heavy toll on my health. I am trying to think about what back-up options I have and how bad they are. This is where you feedback is needed most:

1) The “biotech” industry is almost non-existent in Canada; there are few companies in Toronto and Vancouver, but their reputations are rather bad and compensation is not matching the cost of living in those places. Besides that, it is well known that the “industry” likes people with B.Sc. or M.Sc. but not Ph.Ds (overqualified). 

2) Many Universities are laying off people or on hiring freeze in Canada amid funding cuts now. Overall, economy is rather anemic from what I see on streets.

3) In all honesty, I do understand that I am not competitive for any decent “research” positions within academia with exception of a technician or a lab-manager (same as a technician) at most. I have never lectured as a TA either (my experience in Germany was 24/7 hands-on lab). I am too old for all postdoc grants or to be a postdoc in general.

4) As it appears to me, I cannot achieve anything within present academic power structure – I do not have a Ph.D from top-tier university, do not have a supportive “big-name” PI and do not have a stellar publication or grant record and I have no way to compensate for any of it anymore. You get only one attempt at academic career. On the other hand, I do not want to waste my time criticizing academia either.

One possibility I am considering is getting myself a certificate of English Instructor, so I could go Asia to teach kids in some kind of school or gymnasium. Another option would be a sort of lecturer position in some second or third tier university somewhere in Asia again. The reason I am looking at Asia is that it the only region with an economic growth (of sorts). In all other places I see only stagnation or decline.",1,2019-11-27 05:26:04
egpzns,Runebro,t2_bq9kd,Opinions: should I be starting a PhD?,"Hi all, 

Recently I was in the very fortunate position to receive a scholarship to begin a PhD.  Since accepting the offer I have been quite anxious and nervous about whether starting and working on a PhD, particularly in this topic area is the right thing to do.

The cons/second thoughts: While I find the topic of my PhD and it's respective area very interesting, I am not sure yet if this is an area I want to be working on for the majority of my life, and if I do truly want to be an academic or a researcher (as this is really all I know); nearly every 3 weeks my ideal career path changes (albeit, kinda still in a related field). The topic of my PhD is just an area I would like to learn about and contribute to research in. That said, the topic of my PhD is quite different to what I did my undergrad in. I have to develop a range of skills in coding, maths, and many other topic areas before I can even begin to understand the related areas, and I am finding this quite difficult; the thought of juggling this learning on top of a PhD is quite overwhelming. While I hope to finish a PhD, I am worried that I will just drop out because of a PhD's difficulty and the impact of a PhD on my mental health. 

Why I want to do a PhD: If I do end up enjoying academia/research, the skills I develop in this area would allow me to go on and answer questions that would have implications across multiple-disciplines, which is very exciting. I am excited about the idea of attending conferences and discussing research with leading experts. I am always in awe of the critical thinking and analytical skills that PhD graduates have, as well as their capacity for effective and efficient independent work.  I really like the idea of contributing to new knowledge in a field and then being able to communicate it. Ultimately, if I do complete a PhD, the new knowledge and skills I have developed will help me across many jobs, including those not academic/research based. I have approximately a years experience researching in other fields, and while I do find it boring at times, I prefer doing this over any other job I have had (all my previous jobs were quite bad - retail).

If I wasn't going to start a PhD, I honestly have no clue what I would do with my life, other than continuing to work in research assistant positions and retail. Without a PhD i can't really utilise my university degrees in a meaningful way, I would have to go do masters if I don't do a PhD (which I am on the fence about, as the masters programs in my field are very difficult programs and there's a 3-10% chance of getting a place after applying). Some of the PhD graduates I have talked to who did the same undergrad stream as me said they did their PhD purely so they were doing something with their life.

Thank you for taking the time to read my post. Is how I am feeling normal? I would love any and all opinions, thank you.",1,2019-12-28 11:58:52

et1soo,tiacalypso,t2_2g30mf72,"Apparently, my PhD isn't a PhD...","I'll try to keep this brief but I need a venting space. I'm 29F. I was born in Germany and completed high school/grammar school here, then moved to the UK for higher education. The UK's university system can be a little fast-track: I completed my undergraduate degree in 2 years, 3 months; my masters in 1 year; and my PhD in 3.5 years. This led to me graduating from my PhD at age 27, two months before my 28th birthday. My masters and PhD were at a Russell group uni, my undergrad was not. My PhD took a crazy toll on me, I gained 35kg (~6ish stones) from mental health issues and disordered eating.

After working in the UK for a wee while, I applied for and was offered a great job in Germany, so I moved back. In Germany, after you complete your 3-4 year PhD, you complete ""habilitation"" which qualifies you for a professorship/chair. If you want to stay in research. Habilitation takes 7odd years or so, I am told. 

This is where it gets juicy. I, my PI and another collaborating professor wanted to attend a conference. All three of us collaborate very smoothly and happily - most of the time. The collaborator asked me if I knew whether the free conference registration was valid only for a PhD student. I confirmed this. He was disappointed. My PI asked why the collaborator was disappointed. Collaborator explained that we didn't have any suitable PhD students. My PI said in full self-confidence that I was a PhD student and I should go for free. Our collaborator‘s and my face slipped and we reminded him that I was a graduated PhD, not a student. 

I thought this was the end of. However, two days later my PI phoned me to tell me that I do not have a PhD, and was adamant about it. I explained to him that to do a PhD in the UK, you enroll at uni and you are a student and when you graduate, you may call yourself a PhD, or Dr So and so. I explained I graduated in 2018 and was a PhD. He disagreed vehemently. I explained that PhD means doctor of philosophy which indicates the person has a scientific doctorate. And that that was what I had. He vehemently disagreed. He explained to me that a PhD involved several YEARS in research and publishing papers, and that it was closer to a habilitation than a doctorate. So someone at age 27/28 couldn't possibly have a PhD. I told him that it was true that it took several years and that I completed these years in 2018 and am thus a PhD. He, again, vehemently disagreed. And then told me that he was 99% confident he was correct in this opinion. I was so baffled, I actually went on to google the situation after a mutually frustrating call. Near the end, both of us were raising our voices defensively. 

I was incredibly upset and shook by having my PhD qualification essentially denied like that, and so vehemently. I wonder what I could have done better to make him see my point? To make him
understand that I do in fact have a PhD and that yes, it is a PhD?

NB: PI would have seen my degree certificates as part of the application process. We were debating which qualifications to add to a grant proposal on the phone.",1,2020-01-23 23:50:12
eluyfw,d10874665,t2_5ef0cquq,[PostDoc confessions] Burnout is about to end my research career,"I want to share a story of my over a decade long research career.  A career that started with love and passion, and is now slowly coming to an end due to burnout.  I'm not sure why I'm writing this here.  I think I just feel a need to share it anonymously with fellow academics and maybe hear an idea how to get out of this situation.

I work in the area of Computer Science. I started programming in my early teens and had a natural talent for it. Studying CS (MSc) was an obvious decision and I was one of top students (I don't want to boast - but objectively speaking that's how it was).  My supervisor suggested that I stay at the university as a PhD student.  I was reluctant at first, since this was not a career I had imagined for myself, but eventually he managed to convince me and I am glad that he did.  I quickly feel in love with this job.  I was doing what I liked the most - programming - and I had a huge freedom of organising my time, something my friends that went into the industry, I saw, did not have.  My PhD went smooth - aside from occasional self-doubt and usual fears that ""I will never get this PhD"" - and I was offered a permanent position at the same university.  (If this sounds strange - I come from a country where this is possible and you don't need to work for years to maybe get a tenure.)  However I personally ended up being very disappointed with my thesis.  It felt like I am not solving real-life problems and not making an impact with my research.  In hindsight my thesis wasn't as bad as I had imagined back then, but as a result of this disappointment and perceived failure I decided to change my research topic to a different area of computer science, one that has always interested me but I have never had the time to explore.  This was a good decision.  I was fascinated by this new topic and spent every moment exploring it.  I worked for up to 14 hours a day, 6 days a week but none of this even felt like work.  It was pure passion.  After several months I managed to get an internship in a renowned research institute and collaborate with one of the most famous researchers in this area.  I was finally solving real-life problems and making an impact.

However, while the above looks like a total success, not everything was going perfectly.  I was completely self-taught in this new area of research and while I read a lot - several books and probably over a hundred papers, including both the latest research as well as relevant historical papers - it became obvious to me that my knowledge is incomplete.  I would often realise that I don't know some fairly basic things that are normally taught to graduate students. Moreover, no one in my institute was familiar with this new field and I was working completely on my own.  As mentioned, I have made some contacts during my internship and I managed to collaborate with these people and publish some very good papers with them.  However, I started to feel very frustrated about this. Even if I was able to come up with a research idea and carry out 80-90% of work entirely on my own I still needed someone to help me with the remaining 10-20% that I was simply not able to do on own my due to lack of skill.  I know that this is how most of the research is done, but I knew I can't expect these people to always help me since they have their own research and no obligations towards me. 

I knew that if I want develop and survive as a scientist I need to work and learn under an experienced supervisor.  I needed a way out, even if I were to give up my permanent position at the university. Which I did. An opportunity presented itself and after about 4 years since defending my thesis at my old university (one where I also got both my MSc and PhD) I was accepted for a post-doc position in one of the most renowned research institutes in the world (in my new field of research).  On paper things were looking perfectly, but the person of the PI leading the project (and thus my new manager) turned out to be a huge problem.  He is a very nice and kind person, is very smart, has a very good knowledge of the field, but completely lacks management skills and the ability to manage people or make any kind of decisions.  He can barely organise his own work, let alone the work of others.  This new position quickly became a torment.  I was initially assigned to work on things that lie outside of my expertise area and - even worse - completely outside of my scientific interest.  After about a year I have managed to make some corrections and steer towards more interesting topics, but a lot of damage was already done.  Second problem is that despite there being several people working on the project (both PhD students and postdocs), PI organised our work in such a way that each person works independently from everyone else.  Again, I have found myself in a position where I work completely alone and without any supervision - which was the thing I wanted to escape the most during my previous position.  Despite his knowledge the PI does not provide me with any helpful feedback, he is vague, and like I mentioned cannot make any kind of decision, including research decisions. I have spoken with other people on the project and they feel the same about having to work on their own and on things that don't really interest them. Knowing this at least makes me feel sane.  We try to correct this as much as possible behind our PI's back (for example by helping each other with problems) but this is only a partial solution.

I have now completed the third year of my post-doc and I still have one more year to go.  During these last three years there have been a couple of bright moments when research felt enjoyable, but all these moments were a result of collaborations with other people in the institute, which happened sort of randomly (someone from outside of the project stepped in with a research idea and dragged us into a collaboration).  Looking at the list of my publications during this post-doc I see that none of them is a result of my PI's research initiative.  All of these issues resulted in a lot stress for me, leading to problems with mental and physical health.  I feel that instead of developing my knowledge and skills I've been only forgetting them.  I spend most of my days procrastinating and if I can get 4 hours of work in a day that's a success - my attention span went down from hours to mere minutes. Programming used to be one of my favourite activities and I would write hundreds, if not thousands, of lines of code a week.  Now I don't even write a hundred lines of code a month.  This is hard to describe but I feel a mental blockade that prevents me from undertaking intellectual activities, be it learning new things, reading papers, developing my own ideas, or programming (even for fun).  I feel completely burned out and want to to give up my academic career and try to find a different job.  But the thought of doing so makes me sad.  I really used to like academic work.  It gave me a sense of purpose and accomplishment.  All of this makes me really sad - I know that I am a smart person but I just don't feel it.  I want to be in an environment where I can put my skills to good use and grow but I fear that in my current state I won't be able to, even if I find a different job.  Also, I feel that by getting a job in the industry I will lose the freedom I value so much in academic work. At the same time I don't imagine doing another postdoc.

I've been trying to get help by going to counselling but this has not been very effective so far.  Similarly with other things like meditation or physical activity - i.e. stuff typically recommended to fight stress and anxiety.  None of these things really help.  I wonder if any of you been in a similar situation and found a way out?",1,2020-01-08 16:26:37

No publications but good relationships with professors. I decided not to pursue academia due the work-life balance issues and instability. I've since been thinking about becoming a psychiatric nurse practitioner (I know this involves floor nurse experience first). Nursing attracts me because of the job market and the number of specialty options within the field.  


The issue is, I'm really not sure being a nurse practitioner would satisfy me. I've considered being a mental health counselor as I find therapy a bit more interesting than straight up med management. However, I'm not sure I'm cut out to be a mental health counselor. I'm great with people but I'm more interested in problem solving than simply ""helping others."" Ideally, med management AND therapy would be my dream, as it would allow me to understand the whole person and prescribe accordingly.  


I'm toying with the idea of getting a PhD in clinical psych (or even neuropsych because sensory perception is my jam) with intents of becoming a clinician. Due to my interest in personality disorders, being an NP might limit me to simpler cases (mood disorders, anxiety). Also, from what I understand, psychologists I could publish on the side while having clinical work as my main profession. Being able to do meta-analyses, lit reviews, or even small studies would be amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

If I decide nursing isn't for me, would trying to get a PhD in clinical psych after 2-3 years out of the academic world be difficult? I was told a break from academia would hurt me in research based PhD programs, but I'm not sure about clinical programs.   


**tl;dr: I'm deciding between becoming a psychiatric nurse practitioner, mental health counselor, and psychologist. Would 2-3 years of patient care tech experience hurt my chances of getting into a clinical psych program if I had a good undergrad record?**  


Thanks for your input!

agcl87,akiravatar,t2_146wkfbv,I failed 2 modules - how will this affect me? UK uni system,"I just found out I failed 2/4 classes from last semester, for not completing and handing in the work on time. All I have to my name now are an A (1st) and a B (2:1). I don't want to blame mental health issues but I *really* struggled. I was on study abroad for the semester and found adjusting to a new environment way *way* more difficult than I'd anticipated. My grades do count at home, which is the problem - if they didn't, I wouldn't be so worried. I'm in second year, btw. 

I am also planning to do my Masters and PhD, although that seems like the worst idea right now.

Basically I feel really shit about myself right now and I feel scared and I need someone to tell me what my options are. Because I can't wait till uni starts again.

Looking at my calendar for the semester, I had planned to complete this particular assignment in the 2-3 weeks before it was due. However, this semester I have been struggling with mental illness and the past 2 weeks have been especially hard for me to get my school work done. The assignment is fairly large and due in 6 days, and I've hardly started. I was thinking of emailing the professor to ask for an extension, but I am hesitant since I have never asked for one before over my entire undergrad. She also gave us the assignment at the beginning of the semester, so I feel like I have no real excuse for needing an extension.

b237w9,darkmatterhunter,t2_uf1u6,Looking for a new and positive perspective after continual mistreatment by peers,"I’m 2 years into a 4-year PhD and I’m at the point of counting down the days until I can leave. Thankfully, I absolutely love my research and my advisor (for the most part lol) and that’s honestly the only thing keeping me going.

My problem stems from the following:

- I had to file 4 Title IX complaints against people in my department. The guys will *not* take no for answer. Some pursued me for over a year and became sexually aggressive or harassed me via text, even when I clearly did not respond to any communication or clearly said no to attempts to hang out. I would be approached in class, my office (showing up unannounced), or “dropping by” my apartment. I stopped showing up to class and required seminars to avoid it. I was not aware their actions were in violation of Title IX until someone pointed it out to me. 1 one of these people was a friend, another was a close friend, and another was borderline best friend. It seems to be a case of unrequited love, but that doesn’t excuse them to treat me like shit or ignore lack of consent. This happened over the course of the last 15 months and was just one person after the other.

- note, I’ve been asked out/pursued my entire life, even when I clearly had a SO and I’ve never had 6 people mistreat me because I said no. I grew up in CA, went to undergrad in NY, and am now in KS. Is this just coincidence or some weird midwestern behavior? Everyone I’m discussing is from the area or a nearby state.

- there were 2 additional Title IX-ish behaviors of people, one of them graduated, so I didn’t bother. The other has been chastising me for not texting him back after he gave me his phone number unprompted. I’ve been out of the country for 2 weeks and I’m dreading him stopping by my office and asking why I didn’t text him.

- I had to cut out these people, or they eventually cut me out. This excluded me from pretty much every friend group in the department. I never hang out with anyone or get invited to things anymore, which sucks realizing that they only cared because they wanted something physical out of me. All of my other friends live on either coast and I’m an only child with parents old enough to be advisor’s parents lol. I’m effectively friendless day-to-day.

- my only friend in the department is one of those people where you say “can’t live with them, can’t live without them.” If we didn’t work together, I probably wouldn’t put so much effort in. She is toxic and downright mean. She does things like tell me that I’m an overachiever and make everyone in the department look bad because I’m ambitious and driven, even by doing things like joining swim club. I never brag or gloat about grants and fellowships I receive, but she even told me that she automatically hated me when I was accepted because the department announced that I was on a prestigious fellowship. She views the successes of others as her own failures and constantly projects this.

- for solutions, I have done the following: joined marching band for a year to try a new friend group. I’m nearly a decade older and I couldn’t deal with the teen drama as most of them went to HS together.

- joined swim club for the last 2 seasons. It’s ok, not drama but the group is dwindling to 5-10 people and it’s more of an activity rather than friendship thing.

- work out outside of swimming, it helps with mental health and such.

- spoke with CAPS and the ombudsman. CAPS doesn’t really do much for me, they said given the circumstances, I seemed to be positive and doing all I can. I didn’t like the ombuds approach - they told me everyone else had unmet needs and I need to cater to them. I discussed this with my advisor and he agreed we couldn’t do anything about the negativity of my only friend.

- I despise the weather in KS. It has been a harsher winter the past 2 years than it normally is. I’m also very into outdoors stuff and hiking - KS doesn’t cut it for me and I leave every academic break to go somewhere else. It helps, but I dread getting back on the plane and landing here.

- I’ve picked up hobbies like reading (again). 

- I had a rapid onset of allergies to cats and dogs, so I can’t volunteer in the animal shelter anymore. I have a pet lizard and he’s great, but I can’t really get anymore with my travel.

I don’t want to live my life borderline hating everyday, but that’s the point I’m at. I’m even considering driving home and *living with my parents* for part of the summer (I left for college 10 years ago and haven’t been home for more than 3 weeks at a time). I figure if I’m at least near hiking and a better outdoor situation, that could help. Any ideas or suggestions? I don’t want to look back negatively on this part of my life/career that will be a huge defining moment and I want to make the best of it. ",7,2019-03-17 08:41:58
b03sb7,kxvz,t2_3cchhepz,You have other options.,"That 'joke' about poor mental health in graduate school is not a ""haha"" kind of joke. It's gallows humor. People die here. 

The power structures in academia are deeply troubled and cannot be salvaged. 

For example, a first-year female PhD student was convinced into coming in to the lab at absurd hours to check on experiments. This was a bit frustrating, but she thought it was just something she'd have to be willing to accept to her to pursue this wonderful opportunity!

Over time, her advisor began criticizing her work. There were mistakes and she was pressured to increase her hours in the lab. She saw less of her friends and became more committed to finding a way to please her advisor.

By the second year, she was spending nearly all her waking hours in the lab. She had little contact with anyone who was not part of the lab. She was fully committed. She was in the lab alone at night and in weekends, except for when a post-doc or the advisor were there. She was dedicated to her important work! 

**She was repeatedly sexually assaulted.** After a long period of silent trauma, she made a complaint. The department protected the advisor. She left the university and got a job working at a grocery store.

It doesn't matter what field you are in. The power imbalance in academia is exploitative to the very core. A math student is just as likely to put a bullet through her brain as an literature student.

Do not be complicit in systems of authoritarian exploitation. Do not go to grad school. 

You can study anything you want on the internet. Get a library card. Make friends with the research librarians. Check out scholar.google.com and Web of Science. Ask the library if they'll get subscriptions to any journals they don't already have.

Find a group of people who are interested in a similar topic. Have conversations online or in a coffee shop or on camping trips. Check one another's work for errors and then share it online for free. If you need money, tell the people you know what you are working on and ask if they can help you out with living expenses.

Get a ham radio license and buy a schoolbus. Ask for help on irv2.com with turning it into a little house with wheels and a nice sunny workspace in the back, where the kids used to sit and wave on their way to school. Get a national parks permit. Paint the side of your bus to tell people what you are working on. Talk to the park rangers and see if they can set you up with an place to park your bus in exchange for giving free classes to children at the park visitors center.

Build your own Magic School Bus. Ms. Frizzle didn't need a PhD to capture the imagination of a generation of children and you don't need one either.",2,2019-03-12 05:02:26
avp3cr,mahathu,t2_16zef6,Finding research opportunities THIS summer,"Hey y'all,

I'm a 3rd year Computer Science undergrad, looking to obtain another BSc in Psychology after graduating, and ultimately pursue an academic career in the area. Ideally, I hope that having a solid understanding of CS will help me conduct meaningful research at the intersection of these fields, e.g. the mental health risks of the ongoing digitalization (I admit, not exactly a novel research area these days.)

I was planning on interning at the Psychology dept. at a university in the UK over the summer, but just got word that this will more than likely not be an option for me anymore. I was wondering if anyone was aware of similar opportunities over the summer/early fall that are still receiving applications, considering how far into 2019 it is already. I'm currently attending school in the US but am a EU citizen. Thank you, and best of luck for all your future academic endeavors!!",1,2019-02-28 09:15:35
arlxwf,inkblotblotink,t2_38c04ta5,Should I contact former PI for recommendation?,"Hey all, 

So, I think I'm in a strange situation right now. I had to leave my PhD a few months ago due to some reasons at this very fancy uni in my country (has a good international reputation).

It was mostly because, the faculty I was working with was a kind of bully and working with him for a long time would work affected my mental health significantly. 
I have a paper published in a journal from that time I worked with him.

I kept no contact with that prof after I left that place to keep myself same and while I was leaving, I did not argue or fight with him or anyone just because it's not professional and also because I'm not an idiot and our paths may cross sometime in the future. So, you can say that I went on my seperate way quite peacefully with no drama. 

Now, after months I'm reapplying for a PhD mainly to Europe and some North American universities. And I am being advised to take his recommendation letter and being told that I should talk to him because he will be contacted since I have a paper with him so it's better that I talk to him myself. And some even said that I'm sabotaging my career by not talking to him and should just put up with it. And that the worst he can do is say no.

But given the dynamics of my relationship with him I don't really want to email him again and ask for a favor.

What do you think is advisable in this situation? Thanks!

Tl;dr- left PhD due to toxic supervisor relationship, had a paper published with him, did no drama while leaving and left very peacefully you can say, reapplying elsewhere, do I get his recommendation?

64v5hs,mistixs,t2_n7ux4,"Studies show that grad students have higher mental illness rates than the general population. Are you mentally ill, or no? If so, were you mentally ill prior to entering grad school?","I ask because, while there's no doubt that grad school is stressful, I wonder if part of the reason may be because mentally ill people are more likely to enter grad school.

I mean, studies do show that mental illness rates are higher among not only researchers, scientists, artists, and writers, but also their families, implying that part of it is genetic (as opposed to situational.) http://www.livescience.com/24023-study-strengthens-link-between-creativity-and-mental-illness.html

Thus I wasn't surprised to see that mental illness rates were highest in Arts majors and lowest in Business majors. https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-love-and-war/201511/graduate-school-and-mental-illness-is-there-link

Also, apparently mental illness rates are higher among Psychology majors. I wonder if part of the reason may be that these people's mental illnesses are what made them interested in psychology.

I think I personally might be an example because I'm considering grad school and I have bipolar disorder, anxiety, and OCD.

I'm hoping that the main cause of grad school's higher mental illness rates is due to mentally ill people (like me) simply being more likely to enter grad school, rather than grad school taking a massive toll on mental health, in which case grad school may not be for me, someone who is already less than stable.

6r0ncv,academiaquestion1,,"Trying to petition for removal of grades due to hardship. I made a mistake and finished my courses while dealing with domestic violence and severe mental health issues. I received C-'s, but the grades were really way lower & the result of teachers curving/bumping grades (sometimes for whole class).","**Background**: undergraduate who has faced numerous obstacles, including domestic violence, homelessness, and severe mental health issues. Trying to appeal for withdrawal/removal of grades from past semester(s).

**Story**: My registrar's office rejected the first appeal on the grounds that 1) C-'s aren't low enough for removal (I wish I had known and not tried!) 2) severe domestic violence and severe mental health issues aren't severe enough circumstances.

Rejected petition in hand, I went to every academic and counseling resource I could find at my school, asking for advice. All the university officials seemed scared to give me advice on my case, as though they didn't want to break any rules by helping(?) me too much. One secretary *did* tell me that I should try soliciting letters from professors.

So now I've emailed two professors, asking for help.

One of these professors gave me a C- in a class where my otherwise D/F-grade was bloated by extra credit/work. He also had a TA to whom I had mentioned my anxiety. Remembering these things, I asked him to write a note explaining that 1) my grade was a ""pity grade"" and 2) that I had mentioned anxiety to the TA. He tersely replied by refusing to acknowledge that he gives out ""pity grades,"" and then he said that the TA doesn't remember me mentioning anxiety.

Frustrated but persevering, I emailed a second professor--this one a private music teacher whose classes I received A's in. I've mentioned that I've dealt with domestic violence, homelessness, and mental health issues to this professor before. She has a pessimistic personality, thinks mental health issues are a scam, and discourages a lot of students from their career and academic goals. But, nonetheless, she's the professor I've known best and longest. So I asked her for a note supporting my petition. Discouragingly, she ignored all the personal circumstances I informed her of and instead threw out insults, lambasting me for ""trying to raise my GPA."" In the end, she has now told me she's only willing to write a ""short note"" speaking to my ""character and honesty."" But she also admonished me and insisted that my actions are misguided and going to result in a rejected appeal ""because [I'm] just trying to raise my GPA.""

**Conclusion/help request**: So, at this point, I've faced myriad obstacles, but I'm desperately trying to figure out *how to strengthen my appeal's case.* My school told me that this second appeal is my last chance at the matter. I'm going to ask my private therapist for a note; I'll reuse a note from a previous university therapist; and I'll have a note from this other pessimistic professor. The notes from the school therapist and private therapist will likely only say ""we saw this patient on (dates way after the bad semesters),"" because of their medical regulations or what have you. 

- What more can I do to strengthen my case?

- How should I phrase my appeals letter?

- How can I get the committee to understand the gravity of the situation? My private circumstances remain tenuous, for example, and I am dealing with violent people on my personal life.",3,2017-08-02 00:47:29

I got into a very competitive postdoc, which speaks to this, and it's a postdoc where the mentors really give a lot of help to the mentees to get grants to acquire faculty positions/get academic jobs, etc. However, due to some difficult things that happened in my personal life (several things but mainly being in an abusive relationship), I started screwing up a lot just when I started this prestigious postdoc. I've tried so hard and so many times to recover but nothing ever seems to be ""enough"" to get back to the winning streak I had felt I was on before. I feel like everyone has lost faith in me and the situation feels hopeless to get back on track and still get an academic job and be respected by mentors/my peers/in the field, etc. I didn't feel like I could explain about the abusive relationship but referenced in a vaguer sort of way that I had had difficulties in my personal life. Mentors seemed kind of confused more than anything and skeptical but sort of seemed like that was an OK thing to say? I can't tell...I just get this feeling of being rejected, ostracized, shamed, looked down upon, etc. etc. etc. I haven't been on top of things, have been late in getting things done, have not published enough or accomplished enough generally and now have been a postdoc for more than 4 years already. I am thank goodness out of that relationship once and for all and feeling more functional now but it feels like I'm trying to swim up a waterfall or something and I worry that I will keep expending all of this energy and just never make it. I feel sad and angry like there is no leeway for having any personal issues arise that would compromise one's productivity for a certain period of time unless it was something totally socially acceptable/out in the open like having a baby or having cancer or something (but even then?). It just feels like anything having to do with a relationship or emotional or mental health is so shameful to have as a reason for screwing up for a period of time and like there is no understanding or forgiveness or ability to think that's legitimate as a reason to not do well for some period of time. I feel sad and angry and worthless and hopeless. I have so much fight in me and in the past in my life I've been very resilient when it comes to overcoming difficulties but academia can just feel so....soul-crushing...I feel ashamed, hopeless, worthless, and utterly ostracized and rejected and that it's sad because I have passion and drive and energy and intelligence and want to do great things and really could if people were willing to give me another chance to start over or something...am I making any sense? Is there any hope or do I just have to leave academia and start a new path now? Thanks for any advice...",5,2017-10-27 22:07:00
7zb18n,randomprecision1331,,Need to quit but I'm concerned about long term effects,"Summary of situation:

- Fourth year at a community college
- Terrible students, terrible morale, toxic coworkers. Everyone there looks miserable or worn out or both.
- Five years experience as an adjunct at three four year schools before that.
- Live an hour away because I don't want to live in the rural area the college is in.

I want to quit after this year something fierce. I have had it with the awful students, low morale, miserable people all around. Every day is a struggle to go to this hellhole. I actually miss being an adjunct because I did that at good schools where students paid attention and did fairly well, as opposed to basically talking to a wall day in and day out at this dump. The ONLY reason I took this job was because it was full-time.

Over the past four years I have become severely depressed. I feel no connection to the job, the people there, or where I currently live since I had to move to be closer to this job and I'm still too far from everyone I know. I don't feel like an active participant in life anymore. I go to work, I come home, I don't do much else.

I have about $25K in savings, no loans of any kind, no dependents, no financial responsibilties other than rent and utilities.

I want to resign after this year, move somewhere I actually want to live (probably back to my old neighborhood), and regroup. I *need* to regroup. This college has been the worst mistake of my life.

I am pretty much willing at this point to live off my savings for an extended period of time to escape this misery, but I am worried about the long-term effects on my future employment with a gap of a year or so (if I possibly get back into academia somewhere else). I am concerned future employers will not understand taking time off for mental health reasons.

I feel lost and don't know what to do anymore. Leaving this job and regrouping will do wonders for me in the short term, but I am worried about the long term. Teaching is the only career I've had and I view my chances of getting another job outside academia as not that great as a result.

32vyjw,msolz,t2_kgmr7,Disobedient PhD student,"I am doing a PhD in a microbiology/biophysics lab where people work almost exclusively at the wet bench. A PhD typically takes ~ 5 to 6 years in my department. In my first four years I produced two publications in reputable journals - at least par for the department. In my final year, I decided that rather than do more wet bench experimental work exclusively, I would start teaching myself computer science so that I could try to get a post-doc in a computational biology lab and hit the ground running already knowing some fundamentals of CS. I designed a bioinformatics project for a third paper that was a logical extension of my previous papers and completely makes sense with my thesis topic.

Trouble is, I've had to sacrifice some my of my wet lab productivity for the sake of this new direction. My professor does not understand computers at all, and can't figure out I'm doing this. While I feel like I've made some impressive progress, she has started trashing me, saying my project is a waste of time, and that nobody else in the lab does this kind of thing -- that I'm being arrogant for trying something outside the scope of her lab and wasting the public grant money which funds my salary. She really has only published a particular type of research for her entire career. True, the project is not really in her field, and it must be frustrating for her not being able to evaluate its merit or progress. However my goal was to eventually start a collaboration with someone knowledgeable in the field so that this work ultimately results in a paper (good for her, and me), and also give me the skills I want for my next job. My argument is that I've earned the right to take this chance b/c I've already published my quota of papers, and a PhD isn't about pure productivity, but also about setting me with skills for the career I want.

Am I being a jerk by not listening and wasting public money? Any advice? I'm going to GTFO of that lab in ~ about 4 months, but this dispute is starting to be a real problem for my mental health, and I don't really want to sabotage my reference letter.

Areas of research that interest me, in no particular order-

-Life extension, rejuvenation.  Helping people live longer, healthier lives, with the eventual goal of having a 100-year-old with the body of a 30-year-old, or something.

-Regeneration, stem cell treatment.  Regrow lost limbs and organs, teeth, eyes, whatever.  Grow your own organs for transplant, etc.

-Psychedelics and their potential for treating various mental health disorders.  By extension, national drug policy.  Too many politically incorrect substances are illegal for no reason, and they may have medical uses.  Aside from that, perfectly legal recreational drugs are more addictive and physically damaging than many of the illegal/restricted ones.

-Cognitive enhancement, both in regards to maintaining cognitive function long-term, (i.e., fix Alzheimer's and general dementia,) as well as enhancing normal healthy adults.  Also, substances that treat mental disorders like depression and anxiety with fewer side effects or addiction (aside from the illegal psychedelics).

-More generally speaking, I'm interested in refining drugs, minimizing side effects, targeting exactly the desired systems and no more.  Developing more precise treatments.

I'm currently working as a chemistry tutor for the college, and got an award from the chemistry department this semester.

So.  What degree would be good?  PharmD?  PhD?  What kind of program should I be looking for?  Where should I be looking?  I'd like to stay in the US.  Michigan, preferably, but I'd be willing to explore other states as well.  A PhD in pharmaceutical sciences, biochem, something else? PharmD with a specialty in clinical pharmacology?

I've heard that whatever my degree, I wouldn't likely be hireable right out of college, that some kind of post-doc fellowship would be necessary to get companies to look at me seriously.  Is that true?  Would there be a difference between a PhD and a PharmD at that point?  What would my educational and career path possibly look like?

How about funding?  Probably not worth taking the SAT/ACT at this point, since my GPA should speak for itself? I've learned that many (most?) PhD students get their tuition paid for and a stipend in exchange for being a TA/research assistant.  Definitely helpful, but I would have to finish a bachelor's first, that funding is most important.  If I go straight to pharmacy school I may or may not need a bachelor's, depending on where I go.

I'd be fine with transferring somewhere to finish a bachelor's, then apply for a PhD program.  Whatever program I end up in, I imagine most or all of my current classes will be applicable, so I'm not in a huge rush, but I need to start making some decisions and figure out where I want to go with my life.  I'm led to believe that the specific bachelor's degree isn't terribly important as long as it's mostly related?  I.e., a bachelor's in organic chem, biochem, pharmaceutical sciences, whatever, would all qualify for a PhD in something I want?

I'm kind of lost and not sure where to find answers, hence the asking several reddit communities.  I've asked some of my professors too, but haven't gotten much direction yet.  Meeting with a couple more this summer, hopefully.",1,2015-05-27 03:55:23

I attend the University of Houston (in Texas) and I am completing the prerequisite courses this semester to start my master's degree.  A short history as to why I'm doing this... I have a decade and a half (outside of school) of having jobs that I've really liked but that have TERRIBLE job security (theater, biomedical research, etc.).  When I lost my most recent job, after some depression, soul searching and wanting something more stable in my life, I chose to pursue my master's degree.

The prerequisites are finished this semester, and now I am at the point of actually starting it in the Fall, but without being able to actually go to a counselor and talk to them, they aren't being very helpful (or maybe I'm not talking to the correct one).  They're just sending me to a link I've seen several times already.  My question is which track would be best to pick for me and for the real world considerations of getting and keeping a job.  I have four options:

1.  Core
2. Data Analytics
3. Parallel and Distributed Systems
4. Interactive Media

These are my thoughts on the matter so far:  The interactive media track seems weighted toward gaming design and things of that nature, which doesn't really fall under the stable category.  With my decade long background in biomedical research the Data Analytics may be a good option for me as far as ability to get a job when the degree is over.  The description for Parallel and Distributed Systems says ""emphasizes theory, design and evaluation of parallel computations, protocols, and vector and distributed data applications"", and I'm at a loss as to what those applications would be, so I'm not sure at all about this track.  And then I'm thinking that because of my indecisiveness, the Core track might be the best for me.

Thoughts?  Suggestions?  6 of 1 just pick one?  Thoughts on this from anyone who has this degree, is a computer science professor, or from the field would be greatly appreciated.  Perhaps I'll get in touch with a counselor who will actually assist me, but I'd rather not wait.",1,2020-04-06 17:49:51

i5fdbe,askingquestionst,t2_6ig6n1ff,Identity crisis by leaving Physics.,"Hello,

I am going to open my heart here because I have been having severe anxiety attacks and I don't know what to do.


I am an international student in Canada. My parents are sacrificing so much to pay international tuition + currency exchange rates to allow me to study my passion: Physics.

Since I am coming from the developing world, I thought that scientific careers were viable in developed countries. After 1 year in undergrad and contacting a lot of profs and PhDs as well as looking at numbers on the internet, I realized that I will not have the financial payoff once I graduate. While studying in here, I do not have money to see my family nor my friends, but I though this would change after I graduated.

Once I realized that Physics, specifically the area I wanted to work on (particle physics) has terrible, terrible job outlooks, I have been considering switching to Electrical Engineering to have a better life with less financial trouble. I would also be back at my home country to study this, so no financial burden on my parents and I would be able to see them maybe once a year.

But I am having such an identity crisis. All my life I wanted to be a scientist, to discover the secrets of the universe, to ask fundamental questions. After I realized that academia is idealised and a terrible career and decided to quit while I am still early in it, I started experiencing an identity crisis. I am afraid of being alone because I am afraid of my own thoughts, something that had never happened before. If it keeps up like this, I will end up in depression.

I am also afraid that I will regret my choice to quit, even though logically I know that if I don't quit I will regret it later. It feels like it does not matter what I choose, I will drown in regret.

I just wanted to know if other people had to go through this as well and how you managed to do it.",1,2020-08-07 15:01:22
hva49r,StevePoney,t2_5ls4u3tl,PhD applications after quitting previous PhD,"Hey there, I'm looking for some advice or comments on my plan for PhD applications.

TL;DR: Student with strong academic/research background but quit halfway through previous PhD and completely burned bridges with advisor. No industry experience, only been in academia at 28: how much of a red flag is that to a new potential PhD advisor?

&amp;#x200B;

Long version:

I got 2 Master's Degree from my university in France (took extra classes to get the second one, in a related field). I then went for grad school in the USA, to work on something I was and am super excited about and in one of the best university the world. It went well for 1-1/2 year, but then my relationship with my advisor really deteriorated and it ended up pushing me slowly into depression, and eventually absolute inability to work for that person. When it became too much to handle, I quickly wrapped up a sandwich Master's Thesis after 3 years in that place. I left for what I thought would be a gap year, with the intent to come back fresh and working with a new advisor (my program allows that). Long story short, it did not and cannot happen for multiple reasons, and I'm just lucky I thought about submitting a thesis before leaving ""just in case"".

So I am 28 yo, i.e. 4-5 years older than a typical PhD applicant  in Europe, it looks like I am starting a collection of master's, but I still would like to pursue academic research and eventually get a PhD. I don't really feel like going through the whole US grad school admission process again to maybe start in September 2021 somewhere. I am starting to look in opportunities in Europe because this is where I am from, and also because I like the idea that in most places you know at least broadly what your PhD thesis will be about and long it will last: I feel like I should try to wrap that up quickly rather than spend 5 or more years in grad school.  I am particularly interested in Scandinavia, partly because of the social advantages and work culture there. One of my internship was in Stockholm and I really liked it. There it seems like a PhD application is like a typical job application, and if lucky I could start relatively soon.

I have 4 years of research experience: 2 x 6-month-long internships during my first masters, 3 years of grad school where classes seldom took a lot of my time. I have 6 publications, all in good journals and most as the first author; plus a few conference presentations. All of them are relevant to my field of study and what I want to do research on. Regarding classes, I have mediocre to good grades from my first master's, and a perfect GPA from the US.

I guess that's good, now the thing I am very worried about are recommendations:

* My prior advisor will not write me one. I applied a few months ago to something and my advisor never answered my emails or calls over the span of several months. I also know from some of their current students that they have been badmouthing me in very unprofessional terms, so it wouldn't be a good idea anyway.
* I could ask a professor from where I was in grad school and from which I took two classes (including final reports), and who knows of my research. He is famous and recognized in my field, but never did research with me.
* I could ask 2 advisors from old internships (professors in good universities), but 2015 is a long time ago and I don't know how well that would be seen. They wrote positive letters several years ago (I got into grad school), but I have not interacted with them since.
* Maybe I could also ask a professor with whom I interacted positively at conferences and who is a ""star"" in my field. He is a co-author of one of my latest paper (2018), but we never did research together and so I don't know if that would make sense (he was included in the article because he apparently discussed initial research ideas with my advisor, but we first talked only after the paper was accepted).

I am posting this to know how much a red flag all of this raises to potential advisors, and to have inputs on how I should answer questions about why I left grad school. I did not fail qualifying exams nor did I want to start working on something completely different: I actually want to study stuff very similar to what I have done in the past. I left because of some sort of burnout due to a crazy advisor, so ""personal reasons"" or ""relationship issues with advisor""  would be the truth, but is that enough? I don't think it would be appropriate to go into details as I don't want to appear bitter or childish towards my previous advisor.  What should I do if I am asked: ""could you ask \[old advisor\] to send us a recommendation letter?"" ? Any other  comments or tips or encouragements or whatever you feel may be useful are also welcomed.

&amp;#x200B;

PS: I don't want to get into the details here of my relationship with my prior advisor and of what went wrong. I know this could for instance mean that I am not ready to handle the stress or the workload a PhD; but I don't think so. I have zero doubt that this a a very toxic person and that I was not the issue. The experience of ALL the fellow students and postdocs I have worked with during my stay there comforts me in this idea. And I've always behaved very professionally, even after I left; so the petty behavior and lack of acknowledgement is uncalled for.",7,2020-07-21 16:08:20
hszui5,InvestigatorMurky,t2_6yx0bena,Can I get into a PhD program with poor community college performance?,"Here's the situation I'm in: 

When I was in community college, I was working full time and going through some massive problems that were later diagnosed as clinical depression when I started at an actual university. With that, I was skipping classes all the time and at one point my academic performance was so poor my community college took my pelgrant from me. But after I got into university, my grades boosted massively. I graduated with a 3.64 from at the university (3.86 in my field), joined a lot of extracurriculars and presented at a couple of conferences and I am currently in my masters program at the same university. 

In my masters program, I have been given a grant to study abroad (but was made to return early due to the pandemic) and have taught for two semesters (I will have all the credits I need in three semesters). I have a 4.0 in my masters program thus far and I have some pretty good letters of recommendation, including from the head of graduate studies in my department, who told me when I first met her ""I'm warning you I don't write a letter of recommendation for just anyone"" but gave me an excited ""Yes!"" When I asked to write me one after my first year. 

So since leaving undergrad, I don't really want to brag but I do have a really good academic resume, but I'm still worried that the community college is going to haunt me applying for PhD. I had been told a long time ago by a former community college professor that the committees that decide graduate admission don't really care about classes at the 1-200 level but I'm still concerned. 

What does everyone else think? Am I concerned about nothing or am I right to be afraid?",1,2020-07-17 17:24:54

Lately I am given ever more deadlines, while my productivity is decreasing due to my worsening depression. My MIT and Stanford-educated coworkers are checking in on my progress too often for my comfort, and the situation is looking unsustainable. Should I tell them about my depression to lower their expectations?

Because I moved to this city and joined this lab after the start of the pandemic, I haven't had the chance to make serious friends, or see my coworkers face to face, or have casual conversations. I don't want to leave me complaining about stuff as the predominant impression. I already complained to them about not being paid for months, and some of them responded along the lines of ""it's not the worst thing that could happen at this moment"".

I am more concerned about whether they tell the PI about it; judging from anecdotes he doesn't seem very tolerant of using mental issues as an excuse to defer deadlines. The reason I am not quitting is that he is dangling three juicy carrots in front of me: Authorship on *Nature*, internal job referrals to Silicon Valley and rec letters, and he has a history of delivering on those.",1,2020-07-16 18:26:23

Am experiencing the typical things most of us encounter, from supervisors who keep piling on extra work because apparently they dont care if it takes ages to graduate, to the lab being shut down due to sars2.

I have noticed i lost my spark for science and my work for at least a year now, despite loving my subject before that. Got told this was normal at the point i am in. But my motivation kept declining and I am brute forcing it from sheer willpower right now. But while doing the dishes on a day off that i took, i noticed i kept thinking that if i were to die from covid-19 or a traffic accident, it may not be so bad because at least i wouldnt have to work on this fucking phd anymore.

 With a history of depression but having been relatively fine for the last few years, entertaining that thought even for a moment alarmed me.

The topic of my research was connected with internet-communication in Russian and Arabic. To make the long story short, I didn’t get a degree, but depression and anxiety instead. 

Now I’m a teacher working full time and a half (meaning that I teach 18 lessons/36 hours per week and paperwork). The requirement is also to publish 2 articles per semester, but I simply cannot imagine how to do that. I have publications from the past, but I know that they are bad (they are published in low-quality journals without any reviews). The department where I work does almost no research except for this publications for the sake of publications.

I get to do my thesis in the top lab but there are buts here. I have chronic depression and have been struggling in every aspect of life. Of course I can come up with other excuses such as working full time to fund my studies and covid. 

However, now I'm in a more stable situation and will have more time for the project. Lately I've been starting to have doubts mostly about my self but also the lab. When I first started there I was told by people who work there that many people have left the lab, whatever that meant. I was told that previous people in my position have been paid but I won't be. The people in the lab treat me like air.

The above things I can bare with. The most difficult thing is getting help from my tutor. This person seems like they don't know how to help me and will not admit that. We are in okay terms but I haven't made progress since I am stuck with something that is not a thing you can look up from the internet so I'm completely dependent on the tutor. How could I discuss this with the PI (without putting my tutor in a bad light)? Do you think the person could help but doesn't want to? I know it sounds silly and quite paranoid but I just have a feeling that everything is not how it should be.

Or is this all about me? The tutor sees that I have not been working 24/7 like all people in the lab seem to do. So this person thinks I'm not worth getting help?

dptmaf,clayhiiz,t2_4x2490h7,Self-funded PhD,"TL;DR: I am currently doing a self-funded PhD at a dream university of mine; 1 month in, I am already having big issues with my supervisor. I am starting to regret my decision.

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago, I applied to one of my dream universities for a PhD position, but I didn't expect to receive an offer... To my surprise, in February, I was told that I have been offered a place. For about three years prior to this - I didn't have much success with finding a PhD in the field that I wanted (computational chemistry).

Before I continue, I just want to mention a little bit about my background: I come from a single parent background and I didn't have the best academic start (I only achieved mainly Cs at GCSE due to not valuing education and also due to home issues). Things changed at sixth form; I received 2 A\*s, one A and 2 Bs in the three sciences, maths and further maths (had to self-teach further maths).  I managed to make it to one of the top universities in the UK; during my first year I was in the top 5-10% of my year with a high first mark (I also achieved top grade in the maths &amp; physics subsidiary exam in the year). But things started to get bad after first year with issues regarding depression. By second year, my grades slipped by 8% (scrapped a first) and by third year my grades slipped by another 10%. Thankfully, I managed to get CBT therapy (after being diagnosed with clinical depression) before my fourth year - and I ended up with a high 2.1 overall (a 1st for my research in 4th year) for my degree. But I felt like my grade, despite being good, didn't show my true potential.

After my undergraduate masters, I received a funded CDT (1+3) postgraduate position at the same university that I did my undergraduate. I mainly did it because I wanted to do a more mathematical degree because I wasn't satisfied with the level of maths in my previous degree (I regret not picking theoretical physics for undergrad). Things didn't turn out well due to issues regarding rent and me having issues with my supervisor; I only completed the first year. Basically, the course wasn't a good fit and the supervisor I had, during the final 3 months of the first year tipped ,things over the edge. I was 3% short from being able to continue onto PhD due to getting a poor grade during the research part of the course. 

After this incident, I decided to apply for PhD with no success - due to not knowing how to approach finding one. It wasn't until last year that I realised how to approach applying for a PhD - and I ended up with two offers and two top universities in the field I wanted. Unfortunately, my top choice university didn't have funding for me in the end; they notified me three months later. I was devastated. Soon afterwards, the other place I had an offer for also notified me that I wasn't chosen for a studentship (4 months after I was interviewed). My supervisor from the other university told me he has funding - but due to Brexit I would have to move to Spain eventually. This didn't sound too enticing to me, and I thought to myself (you know, I only have one life and a PhD was something I have wanted to do ever since I started to take my academics seriously). So I took the offer of doing a PhD self-funded at my dream university. I think losing my place at the CDT made me feel like a failure, academically, and i wanted to prove to myself that I was good enough - and what better place than at one of the most prestigious universities in the world doing a project that I am strongly passionate about.

I had a skype interview with my supervisor shortly after receiving the offer (I didn't get interviewed by him or even had direct conversation with him prior to this) and he said that he's happy to support me knowing that I'm self-funded; he said that so as long as I am doing the work, he'll support me as much as he can - he even said that if I need to work more remotely, that I can. He even said he would try to notify me of any TA jobs. This seemed very reassuring to me; I knew, due to my three years of experience of working a lot of jobs, that I could find a job on my own to support my studies - all I needed was a supportive supervisor. The Skype interview we had was so reassuring that I felt excited about the PhD - despite the self-funding element that came with it. But, I know more than anyone, that if I am motivated I am wiling to work tirelessly if it meant doing what I am  deeply passionate about.

But since starting this PhD things haven't been going well. I feel out of place in my group; my supervisor is NOT showing much support. My personality seems to clash with my supervisors. He never notifies us when he is free, he didn't even bother to read my analysis of a spectrum that I sent him via email. He constantly makes me feel like an idiot - despite me being the only person in the group that seems to be progressing the most with spectrum analysis. Also, he still hasn't even confirmed a project for me.

I'm already starting to feel depressed because I know the only way this PhD could work self-funded was with my supervisor showing me the support that he said he would show me when we had the first Skype interview. I feel like I made a massive mistake coming here. It is not the work I am struggling with, it's everything else. I've spoken to my university advisor about my issues with my supervisor and I have an appointment on Tuesday.",1,2019-10-31 20:42:52

dmssho,Jmadd3,t2_4rh2fpg5,I miss academia and I miss history,"Hey Everyone,

I've been drinking due to depression so my apologies to everyone who has to read this.

Ever since I was a boy, history was the only thing that kept me going in life. When I was neglected, I had stories of Theodore Roosevelt and how he persevered to help me go through my childhood trauma. Whenever I was bullied through high school and was an outcast, I had my history books to give me comfort that everything will pass and if I worked hard everything will work out.

So I worked really hard to get into a good history program in order to open up the possibilities for me to get into academia. When I was in my undergrad, I worked twice as hard to the point I scarified my social life in order to grow my skills as a historian. My whole life had a main goal of being a historian because of how it got me through my terrible childhood. I had to contribute to the field in anyway I can because I wanted to contribute to it as it has contributed to me. If it wasn't for all of the stories that I read, then I don't know how I would have made it through the abuse that I sustained.

So I did everything in order to get into a PhD program. But, I found out history departments are shrinking across the country and that I would not get employed after I receive my PhD. This devastated me because being a historian was the only thing that I ever wanted. I did everything in my power to be a professor and now I have no real world experience to make it in the real world because I did everything in my college experience to work in history. So naturally, I work in a warehouse because I have no other skills.

The worst feeling of all is the emptiness I feel. Though I make decent money working at a warehouse, I don't have fulfillment because working in the field was my only desire. It's like I have no purpose now, none. I miss being in the library and looking at all of the books. I miss researching until I pass out. I miss being mentored by my professors. I worked so hard and I feel like my whole heart was ripped out from me. I love history so much, I don't know what to do and my only love is gone.

I don't expect anyone to read this and care, hell, I wouldn't care either. But I have to just get this off my chest somehow because I don't know how else too.

To whoever reads this I'm sorry you had to deal with my drunken crap.",29,2019-10-25 05:21:08
dizb5h,matchgame73,t2_3u15o8lc,An apology to my students from an adjunct,"To my students:
I need to apologize. I am not doing my best, and I am sorry. I want to tell you why. 

I’m working 4 jobs, 75 hours a week, 6 days a week. I’m not making enough money to survive. I can’t afford my car repairs. I can’t afford my home repairs. I can’t afford a necessary surgery or medical care. It’s very hard to help others if you are overworked and over-worried.

I have issues with social anxiety and depression. Not every day is my best day. When one of my students yells at me or makes fun of me, it is much harder for me to help the rest of you. I am trying to do better and let it roll off me, but your comments still hurt, and they run through my head when I’m sitting alone. I’m human, too.

I’m not actually trained as a teacher. I studied my subject. This included no courses in the theory of education or teaching methods. I’m winging it, every day. I am not provided with nor required to complete any continuing education. If I choose to attend a conference, that’s hundreds of dollars out of pocket (which I do not have), plus the lost hours from taking time off work. If I choose to take an online course, that is time and money I do not have.

My college offers no raises. I am making the same rate I made 7 years ago. If I go back and get a higher degree, I will get $2 more per hour. Since I’m currently working about 9 hours per week at the college, That means an extra $18/week or about $750/year. It would cost at least $40,000 to go back to school. The extra income would not even cover my student loans, and it would also not offer me the chance of additional raises in the future. For the record, my other 3 jobs are not teaching at the collegiate level, as there are very few job opportunities in my field.

I would love to meet with you after class to explain the material to you one-on-one. I would love to have office hours. My college does not give that to me. I am paid only for the time I am in the classroom. Every meeting I have with you comes out of my free time. When I calculate in grading papers, driving to and from the college, and meeting with students, I am making less per hour than someone starting at McDonald’s. 

For these reasons, I’m leaving academia. I love you all, even those of you who yell at me and make fun of me. I want to teach. I can’t afford to teach. I hope you understand. 

Sincerely,
Your Former Adjunct",70,2019-10-17 01:36:27
d8j8mi,Ltrfsn,t2_1awfeeeo,Is a career in academia even possible with severe depression?,"Maybe hard to relate to it but I've got pretty crippling depression which is really holding me back. I know it probably differs per research group and per university but nonetheless there's probably a red line (a trend if you will) to which one could test if being in a state of depression negates you from being efficient or even able to function in academia? I notice the stress from such a job is severe and I see people (PhD) having up to 80 hour work weeks (in Europe). I lack the knowledge and skills at this point in time for most of the work I'm supposed to do and it's not doing me any favours, especially in combination with depression which already makes me hyper alert about my own short comings. Additionally in physical chemistry people are very solitary and snobbish which creates a sense of isolation which a normal academic just deals with. I am having difficulty dealing with the loneliness.

Tl;dr: stress, level of expertise required and loneliness are common aspects of a career in academia. They also affect depression a lot. Is a career in academia possible with depression?",16,2019-09-24 06:22:49

&amp;#x200B;

I am a PhD student at UW–Madison who has been suffering from the most severe depression, anxiety, and related imposter syndrome since starting graduate school. I moved across the country from California to work with my advisor here in Madison. I consider myself one of the luckiest people out there because of how supportive my advisor is and how generally cordial my colleagues are in addition to the fact that I am thriving academically, but I still cannot help but to struggle or to feel as if everything that I am accomplishing is for naught. I often liken my scenario to feeling as if I am treading water at times and going nowhere professionally, although I can notice my own progress and achievements in action. Nothing that I ever do is an end in itself. There is always something greater or better that I could be producing in the meantime.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is for those of us who have either left academia or have completed their PhDs and moved on, or those who feel as if they share my experiences. Do these feelings leave after one leaves the academic environment? Is this something that is specific to graduate school?

I am a recent graduate with a B. S. in psychology. I literally had my ceremony last weekend and now that all the graduation magic has died down I am still unemployed and confused about my career.

I am considering giving it my all, saving up for grad school, and then pursue that doctorate in Psychology I’ve been longing for since undergrad. 

I just don’t know if it’s the right path for me. Ever since I was a child, I have had a myriad of “dream jobs” and “career goals” that I just could not stick with. During my time in undergraduate school, I fell in love with the environment. I loved the campus. I loved the feeling of knowing you are surrounded by people striving towards the same goal. And the respect I had for my professors! 

I am just weary about this longing of mine to commit to graduate school. I had straight A’s up until my senior year—I had/been having a terrible bout of depression and just a lot of existential crises—and I’m just trying to recover from that. I’m also kind of weary as the last year or two of college I began to develop a more reclusive state as my depression set in. Losing my presidential position at an Honors fraternity, quitting my research position, and the decline of my connections to graduate students and professors. Basically I graduated in a really bad state. 

Now I feel the void that is no longer having my name actively enrolled in a large institution. I miss research and I miss not only learning, but actively thinking and understanding concepts and information not many care to appreciate. 

The way faculty worked and lived at my school was very interesting; it seemed like professors devoted most of their lives to their discipline. They definitely take work home. And I think I like that! But I don’t know if that is right for me. And it makes it all the harder a choice now that I’ve moved back home and am away from campus.",1,2019-06-24 08:32:42

Does it make sense to relocate across the country for a post doc position given all of the chaos right now?,"I am a PhD candidate and I have been in the midst of trying to finish my dissertation. Long story short, I have an awful chair who thinks it should take all of his students 7 years to graduate. My committee is also very hands off. After busting my butt for years, my chair won't even give me a job recommendation. I have published over 10 papers (5 first author) and present at national conferences. Its not for lack ot trying. 

I am going into my 4th year in the program. I have passed my dissertation proposal and was in the middle of collecting data when this pandemic hit. Needless to say I probably won't make my goal of graduating in August because this pandemic impacts my study population. I can't collect all my data online. But I could collect it from where I am once the virus concerns let up. 

Because of my chair and my generally poor situation, I have fought like hell to still get first author papers and network. I was offered a position as a researcher and then I would transition to a post doc once my PhD is conferred. 

I basically am struggling with the decision. If I decide to move, I will have to collect my data remotely and doing so with my chair and distant committee will be difficult. However the benefit is that I would essentially be working my dream job. Its perfectly aligned with my niche research and there aren't many opportunities for me if I stay where I am. My area is pretty niche. This would give me connections and opportunities I can't find anywhere else. There is more potential for me at the new agency. 

However. I would have to leave my boyfriend and his daughter behind because they can't move with me. I also have to leave my mom who has been struggling with health issues and my dog. I have been struggling with depression so I don't know how this will play out with me being alone in a new state across the country. 

I need to make a decision ASAP so I can sign the lease and move or else I lose out on the apartment I found. 

What would you do? Is it worth it to try to finish remotely? I will have the resources to do so...its just a matter of leaving what's comfortable for the unknown. On paper it is a no brainer. This will be incredible experience. In reality I'm scared to go.",1,2020-03-15 01:53:54

a5ypgh,throwa2934,t2_xrnuh,"After 3 years, I won","**TL;DR:** A year after graduating college, I got legal justice against students and a Dean who bullied me.

I'm an Indian American Muslim male. During my junior year of college, I was suffering from depression and anxiety, and I was also a physics-philosophy double-major with a pre-med track. I became interested in the purpose of a college education and doing research on the history/philosophy of education to find answers to questions I pondered such as: What is the purpose of volunteering/grades/extracurriculars/etc? Why do we learn the way we do? How do we use these classes to help us realize those things? I spoke w/philosophers, scientists, professors, and other professionals to gather information about these issues from them, too.

I tried starting a conversation among a premed club I was part of, but they retaliated against me. They isolated me, manipulated me, made lies about me, and reported me to the Dean that I was harassing them. They mostly did this out of their insecurities for those questions I was suggesting, but it was also because I was presenting well-researched, justified beliefs that contradicted theirs.

The Dean proceeded to criticize, interrupt, mock, and interrogate me with force. She said I was acting ""bizarre"" and called my story ""twisted."" She didn't give me a chance to defend myself. She'd laugh at me when I tried explaining how my friends were making up lies about me to silence me. She interrupted me in ways that I couldn't even finish what I was saying. I was traumatized. The University charged me with harassment and stalking. They left me off with a warning, but they made sure I'd start therapy (with a social worker who had no graduate training) so I could better myself. I had no choice but to blame myself for everything and agree with whatever the Dean told me.

That's when things got worse. I felt the pain, fear, anxiety, and distrust spreading into other parts of my life. Even when I tried doing positive things (like exercising and meditating) I felt the mocking voice of the Dean resonating in my head. I began sleeping 10-12 hrs/day, stopped praying and exercising, eating less healthy, going to class less, and lost sight in the purpose of my classes. It got to the point where I wasn't doing any studying and felt my blood boiling in my lectures. I had no idea what I was suffering from.

I couldn't do anything to defend myself because I feared repercussions and abuse from the Dean of Students. My friends didn't know how to help me so they isolated themselves from me. My professors watched as my grades dropped and I could barely will myself out of bed for the last two years of college. Not having answers to my questions of the purpose of a college education started taking its toll on me. And the toxicity of the environment around me towards me just made me scared of myself. I stopped being premed because I didn't see any value in the field if this was how things worked. I even couldn't finish my philosophy degree because, during senior year, I'd have flashbacks to the Dean every time I tried writing philosophy. I would break down in tears and fits of rage in which I couldn't do anything every time I tried writing.

My therapist (in hindsight) sucked. He just talked about superficial things (like social skills), didn't take notes, gave me a blank stare most of the time, and just tried to keep me out of trouble (instead of understanding me). He'd just say things like ""Oh, people are idiots."" He even believed in astrology. I never realized how terrible he was until now.

It's now been over a year since I graduated. I've spent the past year taking weekly therapy sessions (with a therapist with a PhD and decades of experience) out of my own will. This therapist is amazing (like a modern day Sigmund Freud) in how he gives detailed answers, speaks truthfully and with justification, and has amazing skills in rhetoric. I've spent the past 2 months emailing various university administrators and officials about my story. I went into great detail about how it affected me and mentioned (by name) the students and staff involved. 2 weeks ago I got off the phone with a senior investigator from the university. She said what I went through was egregiously wrong and should have never happened to anyone. She said they're going to require racial/religious bias training from the Dean and other staff members that were involved. And, best of all, the university now knows the individuals who did this to me and they said they'd take action against them. I told the investigator I didn't want anymore input.

sigh of relief

It took 3 years. But I finally got my voice heard and taken seriously from the university. I want to take a sigh of relief and say I'm fine now, but it's still going to take me a while to figure myself out. It's gonna take some visits to coffee shops and long walks.

But I've been eating well, exercising most days, studying philosophy and physics to my heart's content, and planning on going back to grad school soon.

I won. sigh... Let this be a victory for everything a university should stand for. Let the future be brighter for students who wish to learn and grow. The past is heavy, but the future is greater. And I will no longer be shackled by fear.

I want to extend my gratitude to everyone who supported me along the way. I want to thank my current therapist most of all. And thank you for reading this. It really means a lot to me.",1,2018-12-13 22:54:23

I want to argue that my sharp drop in grades/motivation is due to depression/sleep disorder that is the result of repressed issues that I did not address until recent therapy.

I would like an objective third party to weigh both sides of the story and offer their opinion. I chose r/academia because this situation occurs in primarily an academic context, and you all are likely a more objective than r/snek. If you have any recommendations for better subs, please let me know.

What follows is likely lots of overthinking/blowing things out of proportion. I'm aware of that. *I am asking for an objective judgement of my situation, as I don't want to lie to myself, and I can't trust my own opinion.*

**Facts:** 
- I got into a very selective college program. 
- Freshman year went well. First semester sophomore year I tanked in grades. Had another dip junior year. Did well first semester senior year with disability accomodations. 
- I was known for smoking a lot of weed during senior year of high school, freshman year, and sophomore year. 
- Most students at my uni, even in my program, find that freshman year is significantly easier than any of the other years.  
- I found a disorder online called Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder, and got a doctor to sign off on it. Friends/family still don't believe me
- I got a medical withdrawal for the problem semester, but family and friends think I'm just lying to myself/full of shit.
- If you want more info, please comment.

**Their argument:** Most people around me agree that my sub-par performance is simply due to my lack of ability and work ethic. 
- I smoked a lot of weed and did not attend class.
- I began to put down my institution, and stopped caring. People seemed to think that I became the guy who was ""smart, but didn't try."" (or rather saw myself as such)
- I wasn't the smartest guy on earth. Sure, I wasn't stupid, but the other kids in my program weren't intimidated by me. Brought up in an uber-competitive asian household, my parents never seemed to think I was the next Einstein. 
- Sophomore year classes were significantly more difficult, and many others experience difficulty their first semester of sophomore year.
- During sophomore year, I decided to change careers/majors. Didn't sit well with mom and dad. Pair this with pot and bad grades, I look like I'm a slacker. 
- I did lots of ill-advised shit. Particularly, I tried to start a BS student organization that never really panned out. For someone who thought of himself as a genius, I started an organization with no mission and annoyed lots of other student org leaders to get their members. All I did was further isolate myself. 

**My argument:**
- I'm normally highly motivated. I may not have been #1, but I am very ambitious. I wrote a detailed plan the summer before my freshman year for getting into an Ivy League grad school. I loved working hard - I am not ""innately smart"", I had to work for all my previous success.
- I had/have lots of trouble sleeping, especially during that semester. Moreso than normal college students. Like 2 hrs/night for 1-2 weeks. I saw a doctor, but she seemed very skeptical of my issues. She offered Ambien, but I didn't want a dependency. She instead gave me Trazadone, which I barely took. I didn't return for a followup.
- Sleeping issues persisted until I tried Ambien and ""bright light therapy"" (shining a 10k lux light at my face in the morning)
-  My weed-smoking was never an issue until then. I was always goal oriented; I prided myself in prioritizing. Like every other smart kid in my grade, I partied when I could and studied when I needed to. It wasn't until sophomore year that I did nothing but stay holed up in my room smoking.
- I had bouts of depression before sophomore year. There was a similar period in high school when I just ""let go"". I was bullied (alottt) and moved in between my 2nd and 3rd year of high school, and I never really acknowledged whatever negative feelings I had. Even during freshman year of college, I would feel very empty and shitty at points.
- I saw a therapist senior year and realized that my aversion to career that I was previously very motivated about was likely related to issues with how I viewed my own race. Once I realized this, I got over whatever ambivalence I was experiencing regarding my career. 
- The student organization was a half-assed attempt at validation. If I wasn't in a really shitty mood and had all of my confidence, I would not have started it. It was the first time my insecurities motivated me to do something. It took me a year to swallow my pride and call it off and start over with a real organization.
 
*Here is my version of events*: Had trouble sleeping due to repressed issues/depression. Lack of sleep affected my mood and motivation, and I stayed reclused in my apt and turned to weed. (not the other way around...) From there, my shot confidence and self-esteem turned me into a quiet, weird guy that made lots of off-putting comments.

**Remarks:** My family doesn't completely buy that bottling up years of bullying and racial insecurity led to me breaking down and finding refuge in weed. While they are very surprised and concerned (I never told anyone about this beforehand), they don't understand why the bullying affected me one particular year far after the the actual stuff happened. I am a ditzy and sometimes incompetent guy, and I was in a very difficult curriculum. Not enough hard evidence for my case. 

My friends just think I'm a know-it-all stoner that failed a semester and then got really whiny about it and fell back on a bullshit ""Sleep Disorder"". They think my depressive state is the result of my bad grades, not past unresolved issues (to be fair I am disheartened because I did not perform well).

My credibility is shot among (some) professors, and most friends and family. I'm still the fuckoff that never went to class and never tried. I have one more academic year to kill it and wins some competitions and prove myself, but until then (the end of my college career), I'm still a has-been. I could get new friends, but these are the folks that I would normally be best friends with, but I had such a fog over my head (before medication) and acted badly. My reputation is sealed and I am stressed out. People don't trust me with anything anymore. I would appreciate advice to address my credibility, but I understand that r/academia is not the place for such advice.

72oslb,academiamakesmevomit,,[rant] I hate being an academic.,"I really wish someone told me this before I became an academic, but now my life feels stuck and I don't know what to do.

* I hate academics. So many of them are full of themselves, they take petty shots at each other in an attempt to make themselves look good, and they are fucking hypocritical. So much of your career in academia is made via politics, yet people outwardly take this lofty attitude towards politics. I'd much rather see the academics owning up to the fact that most of them wouldn't be where they are without politics (advisor calling buddies up, schmoozing with the powerful people at conferences, I've seen many of my colleagues going as far as checking reference letters for their students/postdocs to ensure that they're fine). I'm admittedly bitter because my advisor was one of the few people who didn't do this; I ended up at a decent R1 tenure-track but it killed me to see everyone pull up ahead of me because of politics.

* On the note of politics, I actually unfollowed most of my colleagues (so you're still ""friends"" but you never see them on facebook) because they're so politically active, and they always talk about how they brought up the latest political issue into the classroom. I'm as passionate about politics as anyone else, but for god's sake, don't abuse your position and bring politics into the classroom. I'd give even Donald Trump an A+ if he aced all my tests. Not sure if I can say the same about some of my colleagues.

* I hate the compensation. I put in 20+ years of hard work in school and I get paid not even $100k. My friends who left academia are probably pulling in $300K+ at this point. I'd leave, but it turns out that the industry is not so into hiring people who've stuck around in academia after grad school, because these are the people who want to be in academia but couldn't stay (they'd much rather take the fresh PhDs because it somehow shows that they wanted to be in the industry and not academia).

* Research isn't going well. I don't know what it is, but I just can't seem to focus or care about the projects that I'm working on. Maybe my heart is no longer there. On that note, I hate bringing work home in the evenings. I used to love it. Having this memory makes my change of heart even more painful, because I know that my attitude isn't right. It used to be better.

* It's mentally taxing. So many people around me are depressed, so I've actually started isolating myself from all the negative influence. I know I'm supposed to be there to be supportive and shit for the depressed people, but honestly, I'm in no position to be caring for the others because I'm also recovering from a depression that lasted many years. I'm afraid that they're going to drag me back into the soul-crushing abyss.

* I hate where I live. Sure, R1 is great and prestigious, but oh man, I thought I'd be a uber successful happy rich person living in some beautiful penthouse in a sophisticated city. Reality fucking sucks, I'm in a place that is barely a city, I hate it and there's nothing to do.

* I hate teaching. The students are a lot weaker than anyone I'm really used to. They whine and they get upset if you give them the grades that they actually deserve. I never had much patience for people who lack discipline.

The sad thing is, I don't think I have better options than this. The job security is great, the flexibility is great, and honestly, at this age, I don't think I have a great shot at the top companies in the industry. Short of going back to med school or law school, I don't think my life would improve by leaving academia, and it kills me to realize that I've achieved my maximum potential and that I'm not happy.",2,2017-09-27 00:44:24
4kxyrw,BrechtB,t2_y6ymh,Want to Apply to PhD Program but Bipolar Disorder Ruined My Undergrad,"Hi r/academia! 

I hope this is an appropriate topic for this sub, I wasn't really sure where else to pose this question. 

As the title says, I did rather poorly as an undergraduate student due to undiagnosed Bipolar II disorder. I graduated two years ago, and was diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder shortly after graduation. 

My major was French, and since high school I have been enthralled with learning the language. I spent a gap year interning/studying in France between high school and college thanks to a generous fellowship, but resolved not to major in French as it was a useless degree according to my parents. 

Once I got to university (a top 50 university FWIW), I took a few French classes to satisfy Gen Ed requirements and couldn't stay away. I LOVED all my French courses, and finished with a 3.8 Major GPA. 

However, in spells of depression, I regularly skipped classes and did rather poorly in other classes because I simply could not get out of bed. When I was manic, I was sometimes inappropriate in class (arrogant towards my classmates, oversharing - just generally embarrassing things). On both end of the spectrums, my behavior was cringeworthy and while I had very nice French professors who I was able to build relationships with due to the small department size, I wouldn't feel comfortable asking them for recommendation letters at this point due to my both my behavior and my frequent absences. 

A few months ago, I came across a PhD program offered by a highly-ranked university near where my parents live. I quickly pushed the idea out of my mind due to my lackluster undergrad record and issues of practicality, as I have a great job in Marketing with an international company. However, I can't stop thinking about this program and how happy continuing my French studies would make me. Before Bipolar derailed my life, I had always dreamed of a career as a French professor.

I have been in counseling since my diagnosis and am now on medication. My behavior has an undergone a complete 180, and I am determined to stay stable. Still, I'm confident that no PhD program would accept me after looking at my transcripts and I don't feel comfortable asking professors for recommendations as I could rarely rouse myself from bed during my final semester. 

Given my situation, would any PhD program even consider me? I don't know if I should contact my professors to express my remorse for my past behavior, explain my diagnosis (which nobody outside my family knows) and ask if they would offer a recommendation? I'm sure they knew something was wrong but this route seems both awkward and potentially humiliating. Should I explain my situation when applying to the program? Should I enroll in classes as a non-degree seeking student at another institution to show that I can do well in postgraduate courses and build rapport with these professors? Could I apply for the program this year and then try again? 

TL;DR: I was very passionate about French as an undergrad, but my undergraduate experience was derailed by undiagnosed Bipolar disorder. This included earning C's and D's in several classes, not going to class, and graduating with a 2.95 GPA. My (French) major GPA was a 3.8. After graduation, I was diagnosed. I'm now stable thanks to medication and counseling, and am determined to stay that way. Would I have any shot of any PhD program given my circumstances? ",4,2016-05-25 04:34:00
5cxww7,GarnByte,t2_xfbtl,"Which is worse on a transcript: Failing a class (with a grade of F), or Withdraw Failing from a class (with a grade of WF)? [x-post r/college]","Hey there. 

I've been struggling with depression this semester and I've reached this point in my academic life with at least one of my classes. It's very likely that I can't bring my grade up to pass the class. Which is worse? I would assume neither is better than the other. But looking for opinions. 

I'm a senior undergard and have been an honors student at a STEM school, but this past year has been mentally rough and has significantly impacted my grades. I fear the last two semesters of my college career will significantly hinder my chance of a job / eventually grad school (at least a masters), despite getting good grades the other three years and having plenty of experience. Any thoughts about this would also help.

5a3pwa,LumpyCatSweater,t2_ycx1a,Advisor has dementia...what should I do?,"I started my MS degree a year ago, and it didn't take me long to realize something was up with my advisor.  They seemed forgetful (forgetting about meetings, due dates, etc) and somewhat emotionally unstable (crying in class, getting extremely angry if I asked them a question about what they wanted me to do) and confusing (long rambling descriptions of experiments that made no sense). I met a grad student coordinator, and they acknowledged my advisor had the signs of early-onset dementia, though obviously nothing could be done because, well, academia.  I didn't quit the program because I was fully funded, I work in a small field with few available positions for grad students, and because I had already completed a first semester and been accepted to an overseas fellowship program I really wanted to join. I decided things weren't bad enough to quit despite the stress and depression I was experiencing, and that I could probably finish despite my advisor's apparent problems.

After I came back from the fellowship, I could tell my advisor was doing worse. They seemed more erratic and forgetful than before, and now I am worried about what to do. During the summer, they had removed some of my tissue cultures from the lab, and sent them to another facility against my wishes. They were contaminated (as I knew they would be) and my advisor brought them back when I returned. Contamination quickly spread to the other cultures in the lab, and when my advisor noticed they blamed me for it, telling me I was on the verge of ruining a very expensive project. I told my advisor that I thought the contamination came from the cultures brought from the other facility, and asked them if they weren't the one who brought the samples back...they were unable to process this information and just stared blankly at me. The same statement was made to my advisor at least two other times, and again, they got quiet and didn't respond, seemingly unable to remember bringing anything back.

Later, everyone in the lab sat down together and created an anti-contamination protocol for the lab to highlight sources of contamination and mitigation methods. During this session, my advisor acknowledged the other facility was a source of contamination. A few minutes later, when discussing another experiment, they told me to send my clean material to the contaminated facility because there were available growth chambers there...this is the same material that they were panicking over just days before. In the span of a few minutes they seemed to forget that they had just said this outside facility was contaminated and we shouldn't send anything there.

Since then I have found dirty, contaminated culture flasks sitting open on the counter, left by my advisor, and other things amiss such as the lid of an acid bottle being left off, samples that I had in the freezer being thrown away despite having huge ""DO NOT THROW OUT"" labels on them, etc. My advisor is also trying to get me to write a paper...something I'm against since the parts they want me to include are from different, unrelated experiments. Basically, the paper would be a long rambling, confusing piece of garbage.

What can I do to protect myself and make it to graduation? I can't go to the department because they would either propose sitting down and discussing this with my advisor (something I would get punished for later) or they would just say nothing could be done. I don't want to write and publish garbage papers, but my advisor is extremely controlling, manipulative, and downright abusive at times, so it is very hard to get around them...and I still need a letter of recommendation when all is said and done. I am only 8 months away from graduation, and I want to leave with my CV and wits intact. So, what can I do?",7,2016-10-30 01:04:45

Doing my PhD. I am scared, to inaction at times, by the word counts I have to meet. No matter what piece of work it is, how small, I put it off and off, worried it will be shit, worried that I won't make the word count (when actually I always have to cut down the words).

However, at the same time it implies this is the case for defectors with North Korean family in South Korea (12). This is also what the data in their table 3 backs up and is included in the summary.

fy4pby,UsuallyFlounder,t2_633hxl36,Struggling to work on my research because I don't have access to my medication: should I bring this up with my advisor?,"Not in graduate school, but I thought this community would have better advice for me than a broad subreddit like /r/college. I'm a graduating senior in the social sciences/humanities and have been working on research (a co-authored paper that started as an original piece of research) with a distinguished professor in my department. He's also acting as my senior thesis advisor.

I struggle with both severe clinical depression and ADD-PI. I would never feel comfortable citing my depression as the reason for my research struggles (it's my own personal hangup), but I've been slowly warming up to the idea of maybe referencing my ADD-PI diagnosis. I've never disclosed it before because I feel like  this diagnosis is stigmatized, particularly among women (my parents, for example, have expressed doubt in the past about whether ADD is ""real"" or just a product of not pushing yourself hard enough). 

Shortly before the quarantine in my area started, the practitioner I was seeing who prescribed stimulants to me left the clinic. I was unable to find a new prescriber between that time and when everything started shutting down. I've tried discussing having my prescription transferred to my primary care physician twice but haven't had any luck. I've been going without my medication or only using a small amount to ration it as a result. 

I don't know if it's unchecked/unmedicated ADD, the depression, a mix of the two, or something else entirely, but I've found myself almost unable to work. I also have chronic health problems (autoimmune) on top of all of this, which has made things infinitely more difficult. I can hardly make it through the first two pages of a paper I've been assigned to read, much less a book. I find myself feeling completely empty and blank inside my head, like I've started to shutdown and loose my ability to process complex information. I feel like my IQ has dropped 50 points. 

My advisor is a pretty relaxed guy - too relaxed, because he's been way too nice and lenient with me and deadlines so far... I don't want to push my luck. I feel guilty, like I'm stringing him along or wasting his time. In the past he's floated the idea by me of working on my research into the summertime, after I've graduated, saying he wouldn't have a problem with this. A part of me wants to jump on the opportunity and just hit pause on my research. But I don't know how personally damaging it would be to make a request like this. 

I've never had to do anything like this before, and I'm struggling to decide how to move forward. I can do work, but it feels like ripping teeth out and it's horrendously slow, painstaking, and inefficient. I don't know what's wrong with me. I have a lot on my plate with my other health problems (invisible as they may be) and graduating. I have no idea how to communicate this without coming across as a drama queen or an opportunist who's trying to take advantage of my advisor. I tell myself that if I can't manage doing research at this level as an undergrad, then maybe graduate school isn't for me. 

If anyone has some advice or other tips for me, I'd really appreciate it.",1,2020-04-10 00:58:26

fn2u95,imperfectautodidact,t2_3w3ojmnp,"Bachelor student still confused by uni, unsure if I should tell those responsible and go on or just quit","After some to and fro, I finally decided I'm gonna post here.  
I'm a university student from Germany and before skimming through [r/askacademia](https://www.reddit.com/r/askacademia) I was thinking about posting on a German students' forum but quickly found out that people on there are pretty mean spirited and would not seldom respond to students looking for help with ""academia is not for everyone, either you function or you die trying, life's a bitch"".  
On Reddit, the tone's just completely different from what I've seen.

So here goes my first ever Reddit post!

  
I'm studying Bioinformatics which is at its core computer science + biology basics with additional fields in computational chemistry (e. g. protein modeling), or as aforementioned people would call it, ""useless trending shit"". My bachelor's thesis is around the corner. I've wanted to ask for topics but, well, then Corona happened, so that's on hold.

  
This is about my experiences during my time studying and about whether I should continue or not. Most of the stuff we get taught in lectures we never use again, ever. It has come to my understanding that apparently this is normal? But then why even waste time on it? It doesn't help with understanding and uses time in our schedule better spend on more important topics that otherwise will be rushed.

  
In one module called ""statistical data analysis and machine learning"" we never even got to the ML part. Instead, for weeks we performed proofs of correlations of Gamma functions and the like. And I fail to see how this is relevant to us as we are definitely not mathematicians.  
If we get to see how all of those formulae connect, fine, pretty cool even. But why do we have to dissect all of this for eternities? I get that uni wants to get you to fundamental research, but then at least maybe tell us what there's to research about this.

  
Now you could say ""ugh, well, whatever, then I'm just gonna learn stuff on my own at home"", which seems to be what we're expected to do nonetheless. However, there's most likely no time for it, because we don't just do those seemingly useless things in lectures. We also get massive homework on them. Those are usually issued weekly, sometimes biweekly but of course with additional stuff to do per task. Take a semester of about 5 courses and you're guaranteed to have at least 4 with homework.

  
Now there's a rule that says you have to pass a threshold of 50% of points to be accredited the grade you get in your exam. Meaning, you can take part in the exam regardless of your homework but may not actually pass the module (just the exam), because you're lacking in points on homework, so you will have to wait 1 year to repeat the whole thing.. for homework.  
When I started uni in 2016, there was an additional rule stating that you would need 25% on each sheet. This was in a two-semester module.

  
One night I texted a friend about the homework and she responded something along the lines of ""I'm sorry, I won't do it this week, I'm not feeling so well at the moment"". So I had to break it to her that she will fail this thing immediately if she doesn't get those darn 25% and will then have to repeat a complete year. Thankfully, this rule has been removed.

  
Now the 50% on the other hand, not that bad, right? Except when you have no idea ho many points there are in total, so you have to do as good as you can on each sheet anyway. ""I don't yet get this topic, I won't do this sheet"" and whoops, suddenly you're below 50%.  
Or if you'd like to focus on another topic for a bit because you deem it more important to you. You'd still have to put all the time and energy into every of your homework. I would be fine with that if they weren't so damn consuming.

  
In my eyes, spending 10+ hours per sheet isn't acceptable, especially if entire groups can't make it go faster. With the aforementioned 4 homework sheets per week, that's, say 45h/w only on homework, which is withing German government ruled working times already.

  
Now, 30h equal 1 ECTS (European unit of measurement for student workload) and those modules according to catalog each have about 5. So 5 \* 30h makes 150h per module, times 4 making it 600h of expected work per semester, a 5th course not included. That is lectures, seminars, reading assignments, and homework.  
However, 45h/w \* 14 weeks of the (summer) semester = 630h.. just for homework and not a single hour spent in a lecture hall.  
Doesn't really add up, does it now?

  
I talked to a member of the students' council about this and he basically said three things:  
""You can't go by those numbers"", so then why are they even there?  
The second, ""I'm sorry I can't comply with the duty assigned to me by you to agree with you in all cases, but no one cares about your little course at a mediocre uni"". So uh, thanks for the counseling? Helped heaps.  
The third thing: ""It's pretty obvious you don't come from an academic family"". Nice elitism, really appreciated.

  
All of this unsettles me greatly. Is he right? Is it all my fault? There have been times I couldn't attend lectures because I needed the time for homework. So in the end, maybe it is me and I shouldn't even be studying.

  
What angers me most about it is that there's no time to actually learn by yourself. How do they expect us to go the extra mile when you already have a heavy schedule? Some profs are sorry we can't visit lectures unrelated to our field anymore since Bologna. But apparently, there's still more than enough time for pointless tasks. (Correct me if I'm wrong; we've just never been told how any of this will profit our career)

  
I'm sorry prof but I do not learn anything by showing how mathematical functions are related and reinventing the wheel by implementing algorithms that already exist over and over again.

At least let us play with it, let us modify it, so we actually get something out of it.  
As I said, I think it's cool to see how that works. But do this once or twice and that should do, not week after week. You should be given the chance to actually do stuff you want, of course within reason. Why isn't it possible to lay off one homework but maybe, since you're interested in a certain topic, you can ask your prof for more material there?

  
I love studying on my own. I've been learning Japanese since I was about 14, started learning Spanish some years ago, love to play the piano, recently took up violin... And I actually was quite good at all of those. At least so much so that it made me happy and, dare I say it, even proud.  
Then uni came, along with some depression sprinkled on top, and I forgot pretty much every skill I acquired so far. For example, once I was able to play Skyrim in Japanese and got around okay-ish, now I can't even read the quest titles anymore.

  
It sounds ridiculous even to me now, but back then I literally did not have any time in between, be it just 30 minutes, to do anything else.  
I don't feel like I'm studying, I'm obeying orders.

  
What I once enjoyed, I now judge myself for. And I can't tell if it's the depression speaking through me, but thinking about it, it seems like such an awful waste of time to focus on those things to just forget them again in the end.

  
I had the chance to visit the Leopoldina twice and it was amazing. As I said, we actually were told to broaden our horizons by listening to guest lecturers and getting into discussions about their research. But that's not even possible if I don't wanna drop whatever I have to do at the moment.

  
Last summer, a leading expert in Life Sciences gave us a visit and our course director mailed us, we should go listen to him because that's nearly more important than anything we'd learn in courses. Couldn't, had homework deadlines.

  
I wanted to go to our uni's psychosocial counsel, course guidance and said course director about it. But since everything is closed at the moment, I decided to [r/askacademia](https://www.reddit.com/r/askacademia).  
It would be possible via phone, Skype, mail, whatever, but I fear I can't really convey all of it this way. Same goes for this post, if anything is unclear, please ask.

  
Also, I'm kinda scared about how the director would react. Usually, he's really nice (also he held the best lectures I encountered so far) and I once met him during office hours. I went there with a senator because another prof would intimidate students and no one dared to speak up, so I just went for it. Upon arrival, he immediately felt responsible and sorry because he thought it's about him. But I really can't say how he'd respond if I told him that this course is pretty much a nightmare to me.

  
I don't really know how to proceed.  
On one hand, I really wanna get that godforsaken degree.  
On the other, I'm already just so done with and disappointed by it all.  
And I don't know how the master's program will be, I don't know anyone in there. No clue if I should aim for it. People usually say stuff like ""it will be simpler"", but they did so during semesters 1 through 4 and I don't really have faith in that anymore.  
Heck, I can't even tell \*if\* anyone is in there. Most of us quit. We weren't a lot, to begin with, and started out at some 30 people, now we're like what, 5? Can't tell but definitely not even 10. Wonder why.

  
I also don't have the money or mental capacity to move to another uni, really.  
In fact, I did just move, because I've been kicked out of the dorms for exceeding the standard period of study, which is 6 semesters. I'm going on the 8th now. I didn't even shove modules around my schedule for fun, to have actual free time or whatever, but I did have to quit some in between because there just was no time for even more homework.  
Which means I also had to beg for money at the BAfoeG-Amt (German law-abiding institute for student loans), since they want proof you have earned at least 30 ECTS each semester. Fun times meeting the head of the local office and justifying my delay, getting a medical certificate and disadvantage compensation because according to them I'm too slow.

  
In case it matters, my grades are actually good and I do not struggle with the subject matter. Only with homework taking far too long. However, lots of homework topics aren't relevant in exams, adding further to my confusion and the why question.

  
That's all I can think of for now. If you do think this is my fault, please put it nicely. I don't know how much I can take at this point.

  
A good Sunday to you and stay safe!",1,2020-03-22 16:58:18

h9n78d,throwaway8283838jhdd,t2_6qcgu3j4,Is a PhD worth it?,"This is a throwaway account being used. 

I graduated from my masters 5 years ago and am wondering if I should purse a PhD. It seems great money wise, although long and hard. 

For context, I grew up in poverty my whole life and saw education as a way out. My friends and family did not see this as a tangible way to move upward in life. I had one friend who worked at the bank and he bragged about it to everyone one in our impoverished neighbourhood. From then on people associated work at the bank (literally working in proximity to money or a vault) meant that you pretty much “made it.”  

My mother started getting really frustrated with me as I grew older because she could not collect welfare checks claim me as a dependent once I became 18. I have been working since the age of 13 and had all ways had to pay my own bills since then (expect for rent). 

As I got into one of the most prestigious schools in North America, I felt super proud of myself. My parents couldn’t care less. This came after my father lied to people when I was 19 (I was at community college before uni) saying that I went to the said prestigious university that I ended up matriculating into  a few years after. When the friends he lied to discovered I did not attend the prestigious institution at that time, he was disappointed that they had found out (because they asked me). 

Fast forward 2 years later, I get into said institution for undergrad, he mentions this to no one. Fast forward 5 years later when I finished undergrad and go back for my masters (at same said institution), he does not congratulate me or anything. I was led to believe my whole life that attending this prestigious university would make my dad proud and get me the attention that I craved from him that I never received as a kid. Fast Forward to graduation at the end of my Masters, all of the sudden he wants to attend graduation like he supported me during those lonely, late nights at the library when I was studying super hard thinking about a PhD future. 

Although I feel grateful for having achieved this accolade, between working several jobs, time with my girlfriend and studying, I didn’t have much time to spend with friends and cultivate new friendships. That is something that I am deeply regretful of and wonder if I will ever had the close-knit group of friends I once had from childhood, as well as in college. 
Because I studied so much and felt myself become a bit of a recluse, I sorta promised myself that once school is over I will focus on making money and getting my social life back, it’s been quite the struggle. 

Basically, I am wondering if pursuing a PhD may somehow may hinder or maybe enhance these efforts. Not that I am looking to go into a PhD to make friends (the lifestyle is kinda cool, not to mention the possibility of advancing the field I am in), but part of me worries that I may suffer more depression, loneliness and alienation (because of race)that I had felt during my masters program. 

I might elaborate on some of these points later on but I feel this this get the point across. 

Any thoughts would be great!",2,2020-06-15 19:36:25
h0zoh4,N00dles98,t2_cmwx6,Second year entry into a Maths BSc (UK) as a mature student who already has a BSc in economics?,"Realised (way too late) I really really dislike my economics degree. Discovered I liked pure mathematics way too late in life and even so, thought economics would be the more practical degree for myself. About to finish my Economics BSc at Bristol with - most likely - a 2:2 (I really struggled with the sociological nature of the subject - the maths stuff wasn't too bad, although not very intuitive and incredibly rote-learn-y. Having a chronic condition doesn't really help either, but I think doing a degree that doesn't play to your strengths can anxiety/depression/what not even worse).

In terms of mathematics credentials, I got A* and A in maths and further maths at A-level (I was around 4 marks off from the A* in further maths..), and even after 3 years of economics, I find myself having more impassioned conversations about a random Numberphile video I watched or a pure mathematics book I read (some of Simon Singh's stuff springs to mind) than current affairs/some economics paper. I have downloaded all of the first year mathematics past papers/feedback/solutions from Bristol (hehe) and plan on self-learning from textbooks as a side hobby (I've already done some of this instead of doing econ). I hope it will get to the point (in at the very least 5 years time - self study is hard and I'll have a job to juggle, as well as having to save up for the mathematics degree itself..) where I can show to an admissions officer (or whatever they're called) that I can jump into second year (and thus save a lot in self-funding). I'm aware that the cross-over from an economics BSc to first year mathematics BSc is very minimal, perhaps with the exception of the early stats/probability modules.

Is my plan a bit... too ridiculous? Impossible? (i.e. will I have to fund a whole 3 year degree?).

gvsl4q,handicapped_runner,t2_2bsc7zcm,"I feel like giving up on academia, but I don't even know what else I could do","I'm having a bit of an existential crisis. I applied for a job that, not only was a job in the my dream institution, I was a perfect fit for it. I had an interview for which I prepared for 2 weeks and I nailed it. It went as smoothly as it could have been. Rejection. Sure, I'm in the reserve for the job, but at this point I doubt that I will be able to get it.

Of course, everyone tells me that this is normal, that rejections are part of the academic life. But I'm honestly sick and tired of living my life in 1-2 year slots without knowing if I'll be working in the next year. Plus, I feel like my working day is basically 50% of research and 50% looking for the next job and this is starting to affect my mental well-being. 

So I'm starting to think about leaving it. The problem is that, not only it feels like a defeat, I don't know where to start. I'm a theoretical evolutionary biologist - meaning, lots of applied maths and modelling. Therefore, I don't even have enough knowledge to work with large data sets (so data scientist isn't an option) or with genetic stuff. I know that I can work for a bank or something along those lines, but that feels like the life that I never wanted. If I can't do science, I would like to help people but it seems that there are no options for this. It feels like I'm trapped in: a) academia, where my mental well-being will struggle indefinitely until I get a permanent job (or if I get one); b) working on a job that I always thought was never for me; c) going back to school to get a degree that I can use to help people. The latter would involve going back to my mother's house and probably worsen my depression. I honestly I'm at a loss here.

gr2v2f,Al-Uni-Frankfurt,t2_5qjhoucd,A Study on Mindfulness,"Hello everyone,

**\*\*3 Months ago I've posted in hopes of (desperately XD ) finding participants and thanks to many academics from all over the world we have reached our target number of 150 participants. However our study was prolonged until June and for this reason it would make our day and we would be very thankful if a bunch of you academics could participate! ;) \*\***

Me (a bachelor student) and my team in the social psychology department at the university of Frankfurt in Germany in collaboration with the social psychology department at the university of Zurich are in need of academics as participants for our study on mindfulness in the workplace, with which we want to help academics to better master the challenges of this particular professional field.

According to a study in Nature Biotechnology, anxiety disorders and depression are 6 times more common among scientists than among the general population. Temporary positions, the competitive job market, pressure from the supervisor or the fear of failure are just some of the many risk factors for academics and especially for doctoral students.

So basically, if you participate you may actually stumble upon usefully doable exercises to deal with the down side of being an academic.

It actually is a quick study and you will be doing us a huge huge favor and with just several clicks you will be contributing to the scientific research.

Please comment below if you as an academic are interested in mindfulness generally and tell us what you think about such a study as ours.

gnk0g4,throwawayworrier71,t2_6hk3ig9j,I hate myself for not trying harder two of my semesters so far - and looking at grad school just breaks my heart.,"Just finished my sophomore year. I’m a psych major with an exercise science minor. 

First freshman semester my grades were mostly C’s, I was homeschooled in high school due to being bullied and took a while to adjust and then dealt with 2 deaths that semester too, not saying that justifies my grades but it brought my GPA low. Second semester was great and then this fall my ex broke up with me right around my first exam and then I fell into a huge depression and grades ended in C’s and A’s. This semester I ended with all B+ ‘s and one C-  which ended up bringing my semester GPA down. 

I’m not proud of my grades and I wish I didn’t let small things affect me as much as I’ve let them in the past and I’m interested in grad school for psychology and even plugging in possible grades for future, including if I can do summer courses - which is kinda hard for me to do because my mother and I cannot afford it. And I also have zero idea if my school will accept courses from community colleges given the situation right now with COVID. 

Anyway, is there even a slight bit of hope for me, If I were to make all A’s going forward my GPA will be about 3.2 I think. After this semester I have a 2.7 I believe. I just am so angry at myself now for my grades and I’m stressed out.",1,2020-05-20 21:36:52
gkv32y,CraftyAsparagus5,t2_6acv0de4,Would this be a useful research website?,"For give me if I am barking up the wrong tree or if this features exist already in a service already. I am not a researcher, merely a software developer who likes to research a lot of things and am wondering if this idea for a website would be useful and is feasible. Please give me some feedback if you can.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be nice if there was a website where you can:

1) search studies based not just on keywords but also on specific aspects of the study. eg

* the methodology of the study (samples size, double blind, placebo controlled etc)
* the outcome of the study (ie. the cause and effect pairs, or absence of, eg. cause=depression, effect=""low life expectancy""),
* effect size

2) an organised place for discussing studies:

* A discussion group and chat room for each study
* each study only has one place on the website - no duplicates

3) user ratings of the different aspects of the study studies (with reasons):

* reliability
   * trial vs observational study
   * method planning (double blind, placebo controlled, randomisation of sample etc)
   * method execution (ie. mistakes that could have jeopardised the results)
   * sample size
   * conflicts of interest
   * faulty assumptions
* how groundbreaking the research is (does it open a new area of research or disprove previously held assumptions)

&amp;#x200B;

To achieve number 1:

* Tagging:  
   * Research is added and tagged by users.  
      * tags are upvoted or downvoted
      * tags which get a high enough score are committed (but will be uncommitted if the score gets too low)
      * Users should suggest existing tags if available to avoid duplicate tags
      * ai used to detect possible duplicate tags?
   * tags are categorised by:  
      * eg. research method (eg double blind, placebo controlled etc, sample size)
      * cause and effect pairs
      * conflicts of interest
      * assumptions?
      * mistakes in methodology?
   * users can search by tags, eg cause, effect, method variables etc
   * These user-defined tags are used to train ai system so that in the future, studies are:  
      * automatically searched for online and added to the site
      * automatically tagged
      * automatically rated where possible (eg an automatic rating for reliability could be given, separately to the user rating, based on things like sample size or methods)",1,2020-05-16 13:59:02
hyf7z3,throwaway901271,t2_74lkmag2,"Changed my field after negative experiences, but still have feelings of confusion. Any insights would be appreciated","Hi all,
This is a question I have a hard time articulating and one which sometimes requiring having to recall some depressing experiences I had with my educational experience, but I’ve always been really curious to hear from people who may have gone through something similar. 

When I was starting university, I got into a professional degree program that’s kind of like a nursing program, etc. At the end of graduating, you have basically a fixed job title and are competing with others with virtually the same skills as you, with the exception of some specialization through a fellowship or the such. Doing well is highly dependent on work experience: the job you have during school really helps you learn almost all you need to know to succeed. If you don’t have a job during school, you can still manage but it’s kind of like memorizing an instruction manual. You know? Like no amount of reading is going to prepare you for actual practice.

I’m assuming this might be happening in a lot of fields, but basically there’s a lot more graduates than there are jobs. That means starting from the time I was looking for jobs as a student, I was running into either “this position is filled” or “we’re not considering anybody at this time”. I made the most phone calls, emails and in-person visits I ever made in life. I spoke to my peers who had jobs about this and most agreed I seemed to have unusual bad luck. I had people who did mock interviews and stuff with me. I talked to my supervisors in required field experience. I spoke to my professors who told me to go to job fairs. I finally was able to secure an interview after a while, but was a bit shocked when the person interviewing me went on a rant about how she hates her job and how even her family sees how depressed she is everyday. It turned out that even after that, there was still no position available for me. 

I considered dropping out of my program several times, but I had no backup and was close to finishing. I figured my last hope was a practical year we were all required to have at the end. I came to terms with i may not get to work in an area of my liking for a few years, but as long as I had experience and income, that’s what mattered to me. In my first practicum experience, the supervisor was unhappy from me since the first time I walked into the internship. I emailed her 2 weeks prior to when I would start, addressing her by her proper title, and asked what was expected before I begin. She gave a vague answer. A week later, I asked about what time I should come in and other logistics. She didn’t answer, so I called her number and an assistant picked up who said she’d leave the message. I didn’t get an answer back, so on my first day I came the earliest time I knew the place opened. I smiled and introduced myself as the intern, she gave me a cold look and said “you were supposed to follow-up with me”. I said I did, she said no, and I told her about the emails and calls and she said “if you didn’t hear a response, you’re supposed to keep following up till you do”. Since then, she kept picking on me in ways I didn’t even know where I was wrong, and took me aside one day and said “people are watching, so you better be on your best behavior. And don’t behave condescendingly”. It was bizarre because I’m a socially anxious person and very quiet and friendly. I asked her if there was a specific concern she had and she didn’t give a straightforward response. Everyday of that experience felt like hell, but I did my best. At the end, she dismissed that I’m probably not meant for this work environment and that I’m unfriendly and unprofessional. I felt confused because that was the work environment I was banking on for a job after graduation, since the other ones, though more appealing to me, are niche and competitive that only people with work experience during school really seem to get. I finished the rest of my practicums, but once graduation was nearing I was faced with immense dread of job hunting. I didn’t feel qualified to work with my lack of experience, my negative experiences weren’t helping either. I went to my school job fairs and ran into one of the people who interviewed me previously when I was searching for a student position, she said it’s too late to apply as I was in my last year, and I asked her well once I graduate, will I be qualified to work as I have not had student experience and she said very likely no. 

I applied to 400+ jobs after graduating with not even a phone call in sight. I already suffer from anxiety and depression and couldn’t afford paying for therapy. I was in a bad mental state and didn’t think I’d ever find a job. 

Then after some other personal ordeals, I was thankfully able to get to a point where I took some research methods courses. I loved what I was learning and met incredible people. But after taking those too, I was met with some incredibly toxic experiences. I applied for several jobs, got interviews and was close to getting hired, but one place told me they picked somebody else, the other one said they’re still deciding. In the meantime, they offered me a part time role and I took it because I needed to start somewhere and make money. Weeks into the role, I realized the supervisor had no idea what she was doing and gave no directions. When I did what I could and presented my findings, she kept getting cold and angry, often exchanging glances with others in the room everytime I’d talk. Well anyway, I 
was 2-3 months into this thing and she was not 
 on top of making sure I get paid and if I wasn’t either, I could have very well been working those 2-3 months without compensation. They used a temporary staffing agency to hire me, I had to travel several miles to get drug tested and take care of other formalities (also zero compensation leading up to ~$70+ in transportation costs) and they’d keep running into issues because they’d forget paperwork on their end that made me have to travel again for drug testing, etc. All in all, it was a complete mess.

I finally got a full time position elsewhere, which was also a mess. But I was able to gain some work experience and skills and get the job where I’m at now. I’m still not always sure what I’m doing at work and stuff and still making a lower pay than many of my peers who graduated in my original degree, but a higher pay than my last job and have gained a lot of skills. I feel so much more confident in myself than I ever have before and have colleagues who are pretty supportive. I’m just grateful I’ve been able to find something and somethings that’s not toxic, first and foremost. 

The thing is, I really just don’t have any area of expertise really and on one hand I’m just trying not to think about it and see where my experiences take me. On the other hand, I have this whole initial degree that I did and technically am not using it, some part of me wants to find some way to use it again, either through an eventual research job or part time employment in that area. I’ve tried to network with people who are at the crossroads of doing that degree + research, but often I’m met with really surprised responses as to my lack of work experience that makes me have to recall the whole ordeal I wrote about above. I’m good at networking, I’ve always done my part to reach out to people despite social anxiety, but everytime I reach out to people in my original field, I don’t stand out as stellar because of the work experience issue. 

My point in writing all this is to hear from others if you’d be willing to share. I know a lot of people leave academia or leave programs and seem happy about it although I’m sure it draws some negative and painful memories that in no way im asking anybody to recall, but just I wanted to know how you were able to make transitions to new areas, how you deal with answering uncomfortable questions and what your overall experiences are like and what insights/encouragement you may have for somebody in a similar boat.",1,2020-07-26 21:29:56
inah68,DerErdkundeMeister,t2_1714n2,Advice/etiquette on dropping co-authorship,"Hi everyone,

I hope this is an appropriate place to post this, but as the title suggests, I’m thinking about backing out of a co-authorship I’m involved with now. Without revealing too much, it’s for a few reasons. While the results are fine, I find myself disagreeing ideologically with a few of the analytical frameworks/conclusions that are now being put forth in the newest draft of the paper (my views have changed a lot since this project initially started last year and I wouldn’t necessarily have felt this at that time), though I can try to push back on them. The second author has also taken some questionable stances on current issues recently (though I wouldn’t say those views necessarily reflect their overall body of work), and I'm worried about being tied to that somehow. While I’m only a tertiary author, I also feel a bit guilty that I haven’t really contributed to the piece all that much anyway relative to the first author (though a new full-time job and trying to do GRE prep have been keeping me occupied).

However, I think the biggest issue is that this project is triggering some rather bad anxiety/depression issues for me. I was an RA full-time for the second author and while they were well-meaning I had a bad experience overall (part of it was some personal friction/difference in work styles/work burnout but most of it was me going through some really bad depression I wasn’t able to get therapy for at the time), and the paper/thought of working on it is triggering occasional panic attacks and anxiety/depression more generally as a result.

At the same time, I worry that I just might be overthinking it all and I don’t want to burn bridges with/be disrespectful to the professors needlessly over this. The second author actively encourages and has almost always co-authored with their former full-time RAs (and was happy to have me join on at the start of this), so there’s a bit of awkwardness there. This is especially given that I’m considering graduate study in the discipline of the authors (and potentially at the same institutions), even if I may not explicitly ask for a rec letter or work with them in the future. Also, while I could go either way, the project is interesting enough to potentially continue through, and the first author got good reception earlier on the project from another academic whose work and opinion I respect (I had not worked with them prior to this but that first author has generally been nice/approachable/understanding).

The project was largely dormant over the summer so I could focus on my job and take a head-in-the-sand approach to all of this, but now that it’s started up again and the other authors are considering submitting to journals I need to actually make a decision.

So you can see that I have a lot of conflicted thoughts and it’s beginning to gnaw at me to the point of loss of sleep. I haven’t shown explicit disinterest in the project yet and have been showing them occasional comments on the draft/data work occasionally over the past week or two (to the extent I can keep my anxiety in check and focus on it). But largely out of respect for them and potential journal submission deadlines, I don’t want to string them along for much longer if I decide to drop. I should say one slight complication is that the first author put out a working paper with me listed there earlier in the year, and I think that may have been cited already by someone else, so I don’t know if that complicates any dropping-out procedure.

Thoughts (and etiquette suggestions, I really do care about this) here would be much appreciated! And apologies for the long vent/post.",1,2020-09-05 22:30:08
ign6zl,sisyphean_throwaway,t2_7uovf8bq,Toxic advisor advice,"Throwaway for obvious reasons, also editing out names for confidentiality. I guess I'm an incoming grad student, used to be a post-bacc, in field biology, USA.

Extremely long story short, after 5 years working as a lab tech/manager I decided to pursue a PhD with a researcher (lets call them Dr. Y) who I was coauthor with on a couple of papers and ""knew"" from field expeditions, conferences, and other interactions. Dr. Y's public persona was slightly arrogant, a little rough around the edges, but generally likable (in my opinion). People (Dr Y's students included) told me to expect hard work in his lab and I was OK with that because I respected the research and I worked along side grad students in my old advisor's lab and understood the demands they faced. Only after joining the Y lab and moving across the country did Dr. Y's actual persona reveal itself. 

His students seemed genuinely afraid of him and would essentially drop whatever they were doing anytime he was in the lab in order to be at his beck and call. 

The weekly group meetings seemed more like fascist interrogations where he would want to know exactly what every person did each day/hour since the previous meeting. 

He proudly boasted “yeah, this one student of mine quit because of some mental illness possibly induced by me, I essentially broke her.” Later he said he saw that student working at the local home improvement store and bragged that she turned away when they made eye contact.

He purposefully obfuscated research directions (on a proposal edit he completely rewrote the intro, added ""[1,2]"" citation markers for the concepts he included, and said ""this is your proposal, do your own lit search"" when I asked him to forward the papers he cited). 

When I confronted him about needing more work life balance he mocked my increasing depression and said ""your wife will have to get used to being alone because you will be spending more and more time in the lab and your personal life is going to get less and less"" while making a pinching motion with his fingers. 

I tried to find a middle ground but it was his way or the highway.

I could go on unfortunately...

I left the program after 2 weeks of dealing with his persona. This is what my in lab grad student mentor said about the situation: ""I certainly don't blame you for making that decision. Dr Y has always been prickly and sometimes unreasonable, but he gave you just about the roughest time I've seen for someone just starting in the lab and I can't understand why.""

I couldn't change advisors because of a political dispute between my old advisor and the new department I was accepted into. I went to my old advisor for advice and he essentially said he didn't have any because he has never even heard of that sort of situation before. I have been told officially reporting Dr. Y's actions could be career suicide but I also want people/future students to know what kind of person he actually is. He is definitely a two sided coin and knows when and how to show the ""good"" side, but is also very aware of the bad side and takes measures to ensure there is no tangible evidence of wrong doing. Most of the questionable behaviors I encountered were verbally communicated.

Fast forward to today... I have been accepted into the PhD program at my old institution, working with my old advisor. Dr. Y is in my field of study and somewhat well known. My question is, do I report Dr. Y, and if so where? Do I do nothing and make the least amount of waves?

I am being treated for depression, but my PI is unaware and I don’t feel super comfortable sharing that information. The Professor is really great and understanding, but I hesitate to ask for some time off for the usual reasons. I’ve been told that as an international student we are expected to put in more work and perform better (no idea how it’s measured, but that the perception). 

I don’t want to take time off for a few months, but 2-3 weeks just to get back on my feet and allow the medication to kick in. Right now I’m struggling physically and mentally and I draw a complete blank when I sit in front of the computer. I haven’t been able to produce any quality results for a couple of months now, and it seems to be getting to the point where the Professor might see it as laziness or an inability to do the work.

japfaw,Quantum_Pepsi,t2_8gsp93c4,"Chemistry Reinvention Story, in need of advice","Hi all,

Hope everyone is doing well recently. Basically, I attended a state school and did well the first two years and beginning in my Junior Year, I took a turn for the worst. I started academically faltering and failing classes mainly due to apathy and disregard for school. I would like it to make it unequivocally clear from the outset that I am the only reason for these failures and am not trying to deflect the blame on other circumstances. After my terrible performance in Junior Year, I fell into a deep abyss of depression, mainly due to my academic failure and devolving into a bad student. I even was caught engaging in academic misconduct (cheated on an online exam) my senior year and was suspended for one academic year two classes short of graduating.

Right after the suspension was enacted, I vividly remember that I was so depressed that I lost 10 pounds in one week from not eating. Moreover, doing quotidian tasks such chatting up with friends and family and getting out of bed began to become such difficult tasks. I genuinely felt at that time my life was absolutely over and was having mildly-suicidal thoughts. However, despite all the melancholy in my head during that time period, deep in the recesses of my mind still lied the unwavering belief within myself that I possess the will power to succeed and will come back to rectify my academic situation in the form of an academic reinvention journey.

From that moment on, I was absolutely committed to reinventing myself and was firm in my decision to not capitulate on my seemingly insurmountable goal. During the suspension, I devised an academic trajectory to follow upon re-instation into my school and joined two labs to work in as a research associate. I also During the suspension, I devised an academic trajectory to follow upon re-instation into my school and engaged in a host of meaningful extracurricular activities that were instrumental in a cultivating a person of stronger ethics and character. These said activities were tutoring underprivileged students for standardized tests, habitat for humanity, helping at food banks and AmeriCorps. All of these activities were invaluable for teaching me the importance of integrity and I can confidently state that those events truly changed me for the better from the basis of an ethical viewpoint. Finally, during the suspension, I read Anslyn's Modern Phys Org and McQuarrie's PChem to stay abreast with Chemistry and also because I slowly developed a strong passion and curiosity towards Phys Org during my suspension.

Upon being reinstated in my school, I made sure I was absolutely ready to start attacking my coursework with diligence and fire off on all cylinders. I was extremely tenacious to finally avail what I had set out for myself and make my dreams become a tangible reality rather than a hypothetical prospect. I am happy to write that my reinvention journey went extremely well. I took four 20 credit hour semesters and 10 credits over one summer, resulting in 90 credits of post-bac coursework in the sciences. The courses were spread across Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology, etc. Moreover, all were at the 300-400 level and some of my chemistry courses were graduate level including Phys Org, Spectroscopic Method Structure Determination, Organic Reactions, Quantum Chemistry etc. My average GPA across all these courses was a **3.97.** I also took the GRE and got a 170 on Quant and 165 on Verbal. I took the Chemistry GRE and scored and got a 840, which is around 85th percentile. In these last several years of reinvention, I have become quite enthralled with research labs and have got 3 publications (Neurophysics, Neutron Physics, and Materials Chemistry) in good journals. Lastly, I have got several glowing letters of recommendation from my PIs, and my story has resonated with them quite well.

All in all, I am extremely satisfied myself that I managed to defeat all my issues in life and see out what I proposed for myself. I am proud to say that I looked failure in the face and said ""fuck you"", I will never ever give up on what I am relentlessly passionate about. The reality is still important not to neglect and the reality is i am 25 years young but still not enrolled in a graduate program. I am planning to apply this cycle to PhD programs in the US. I am a domestic student and intend to apply to the my home institution (state flagship ranked 30 in chemistry). My dream schools are UW-Madison and Berkeley but given my black marks within my academic history, would applying to those schools and other various top 30 institutions be a waste of a time? Have I already shot myself so hard in the foot that I can't get in anywhere? This was the only thing I feared throughout the whole process of my academic redemption.",1,2020-10-13 23:48:35

I'm currently a senior getting my BA in design and i'm working in a group of 3 for a project. I can't stand one of the girls on my team because if we don't respond to her messages within 24hours she gets pissed and says we have communication issues. (This happened one time by the way.) She constantly needs confirmation about everything and I can't stand it because I'm busy dealing with my other classes, my mom is sick with covid, my anxiety and depression starts coming back whenever I have to deal with her, and right now I'm thinking of dropping a course because of all this. I've been arguing with her since Monday that our communication for the project is fine, we talk twice a week through voice chat and anytime on slack. I didn't respond one night because I was studying for my exam the next morning, and she got incredibly upset that we didn't slack her within 24 hours and thinks we need better teamwork... My other partner also agrees with me that she's a bit much and doesn't have any problems with the communication. I get it, communication is important in teams, but during this covid time, i have just too much going on to deal with her bullshit.

j56yxe,CactusGloves,t2_8chq7kpu,"Terrible relationship with advisor, stalled research, seeking advice! (PhD/UK/Computational Mathematics)","Hello, I am a PhD student in the UK. My PhD experience got off to a rough start and has been barrelling downhill ever since then, and I could really use some advice if possible.

Long story short, my PhD started with the death of someone close to me, so getting started on a strong research project felt secondary for a few months. As such, I wasted a fair chunk of time (I only have about 3 years) just doing basic work, e.g. imlementing models in my code etc. I should mention that my project started off as a collaboration between me/my supervisor and a research group in Europe, so I have been working very closely with someone outside the university, almost as if they were a de facto second supervisor.

In January, my supervisor announced that he was leaving the university for an industry job, and that I would now be supervised by two other people at the university. We had a strange meeting between them, my supervisor, and the collaborator where my new supervisors really didn't seem interested in my project, nor did they get on well with the collaborator.

Immediately after that, the coronavirus hit and I had to move to emergency accommodation within the university. During the 6 months of isolated living I rarely interacted with my (now) supervisors. We had scheduled meetings with the collaborator that they stopped showing up to, and there has been very little guidance from them overall.

I have tried to take control of my research and gain independence, but I have personal issues such as struggling to focus working from home, the classic PhD student depression/outlook/anxiety, etc. that are getting in the way of that somewhat. As a consequence, my research has stalled somewhat and I am feeling very ready to simply drop out, take a vacation, and get on with my life. I worked hard and sacrificed a lot to get here, and I would very much like to succeed, obviously.

I have tried to reach out to my supervisors before to explain and it seems as though they say all of the right things, but nothing ever comes of it (they offer to read through materials I have to submit / set up a meeting to discuss non-research topics / etc).

I would greatly appreciate if someone who may have had a similar experience might offer some of the things that helped them, or anything like that. Hard truths / things I don't want to hear are very welcome.

Thanks.

I've done okay, I have a decent track record in publications (30+ JA, 1 book, etc) and grants ($1mill+) and do a lot of internal and external service, as well as some teaching. I'm currently on a major ECR fellowship. I probably work too much, 60+ hours a week the first few years post-PhD, but have since tried to slow down and ensure I take time out. 

Despite this, I've been battling increasing states of anxiety, depression, and chronic health issues which seem to get worse the more I engage in academia. I'm finally getting one chronic illness sorted which I was hoping would help me get back on track, and then was hit with another, lifelong progressive disease that I'll be managing for the rest of my life. It almost feels like I'm trading pieces of my health for the next publication or grant. Alongside this, I feel as though my research is absolutely worthless and I shouldn't even be bothering. I stare at my screen and think ""why are you doing this, no one gives a sh*t about your work. It's not worth anything."" 

I can't focus on my project, and I feel incredibly isolated and alone in my department which I have tried to address and gotten nowhere.

jk1l18,neondreamscream,t2_4owx2hbt,How do you deal with a toxic superior in your work environment?,"Hi everyone. 

I'm a grad student in Japan (not my home country btw) and I have been having troubles with my research. For one thing my lab is not very supportive. The meetings are only useful for the professors to know what you're doing but they hardly offer any helpful suggestions. I even asked my supervisor if a more experienced student could help me and oversee a process I have been trying and that was failing over and over again and he said I shouldn't bother other students and had to find the solution myself. This is annoying but it is not my real problem here. My problem is this assistant professor who is the most toxic person I've ever met. He has a creepy forced friendliness towards everybody and he said more than one time to me ""I am a very kind person"", which is something kind people don't do that often. He usually say that when he is ""trying to help you"", according to himself. 

Before I list the things he did I need to say something else. I have been fighting depression and an anxiety disorder my therapist said is caused by PTSD. interacting with people is not easy for me. It has never been. I have friends but they are feel and it is very tiresome to interact with people I am not 100% comfortable with. For this reason I am quiet and I am.usually wearing ear buds. It actually helps me to focus, since we are 15 students and that professor sharing the same room. 

Now... he has given me a hard time about the ear buds a few times. He said he went to lots of prestigious universities and never saw such a bad work habit. I told him it helps me focus and he didn't believe me. 

He scolded me for not saying hi and goodbye when I come to lab and leave it at night. The thing is, no one does. Most students are very introverted and we are more comfortable keeping a distance. We still go to each other for small, work related stuff tho. He told me he talked to a postdoctoral student how weird I was for not saying hi and stuff but when I first arrived here I pushed myself against my mental blocks to do such things. And I was usually the first  in lab and the postdoc the second. I would say ohayou to him and he would always ignore me. So I lost my spirit to keep doing it. 

Last week he asked while laughing if any of my experiments had ever succeed. I told him I had one positive result and he sneered at it saying it wasn't publishable. 

Last night he saw me in lab after 8p.m. and said ""you finally became a hard worker"" implying I was not working hard before. I arrive at lab early in the morning and often leave late. I also come weekends occasionally. He has another position in a different campus so he arrives here in the late afternoon and because he doesn't see me through my whole work day he just assumed I only work the hours he sees me.

All this would just be annoying behaviour of a mean prick and I understand if you don't consider it serious. But there is more and I think this is heavier. 

In my first interaction with him he asked me if I knew what chin chin means. It means penis in Japanese. I didn't know at the time. I said I didn't know, to which he proceeded to make a motion towards grabbing the penis of a PhD student that was talking with us. The student dodged quickly. The professor was laughing a lot like we were all high school pals and the student was laughing nervously saying to me "" he is such a figure...""

He also made lots of gross sexual jokes about a few students but mostly about the lab boss, my advisor of whom he is a friend since they were in grad school. This makes me very uncomfortable. He also found it amusing to explain to me why he prefers Japanese Porn instead of western Porn. Look, I am not a prude and impressionable altar boy or whatever. My concerns are not with the topic of the conversations themselves but the fact that there is a power relation between him and the students which makes the conversation not ok! He's a professor and we are students. He is not my friend or my pub pal and he never considered that these topics made me uncomfortable even tho I barely react to his antics. 

Finally, he told me he thinks the new batch of master students is very stupid. He said that about others too. He says it laughing so there's a layer of joking over the whole thing that may let you thinking if he's serious or not. But for someone who considers wearing ear buds bad work habit I think he is very unethical in his dealings with students. If he tells me the students are stupid how am I supposed to trust him? The only thing that comes to my mind is what he is talking about me behind my back and that doesn't help me at all. 

What should I do? I want to report him to the students harassment office but they don't take anonymous reports and I'm afraid things will not turn well for me, he being friends with the big boss and all. 

Also, have you dealt with something like this? What did you do?

Do you think that the free community college proposal will increase demand for CC instructors? Will anything change in regard to adjunctification, do you think?

I reached out for a meeting with a school advisor/counselor and one of my instructors to discuss options.

So: Any ADVICE or IDEAS?

- I’m thinking of asking for an Incomplete to allow me a little more time to finish the missed homework and pass, but I’m not sure if the teacher will be willing. Any thoughts on what I could say to help persuade her to give me another chance?
- Have you been allowed an Incomplete for a class? What did you say/do? What happened in the end?
- Are there any other allowances/programs/something to look into to ask about?
- Would some kind of note from my doctor make any difference?

I would not fault her for denying my request, it would be extra work on her part when I’m the one that messed up. I can’t just give up though, I need to at least ask and hope for the best. 


Other Info:
- I would be asking for only a few weeks of time, about the time of winter break between semesters

I was wondering how is it viewed when a student bring up their past trauma to their PI as a way to understand where he/she comes from? The thing is I started my PhD two months ago, so far so good, but throughout these two months I have made very stupid mistakes that even an undergrad student would not make, and that is mainly due to my “episodes” of dissociation and lack of attention to details. My PI suggested that we should talk about how to improve this next week but I don’t know if it is a good idea to bring up the main reason why I go into these moments of extreme inattentiveness (domestic violence, two miscarriages, and divorce followed by depression and anxiety). I don’t want to come across as careless but at the same time I don’t want to use my trauma as a card to justify my mistakes.

I am completing my PhD in few months, and I am looking at the postdoc positions and it's giving me depression. Lack of job security (temporary employment), very low pay, most likely long working hours and overtime. And on top of that, it is a cut throat competition with every application taking hours and days to complete (research proposals, motivation letters etc..). Having done a terrific job in my PhD research in chemistry and publishing 4 papers as the first and corresponding author in reputable journals, plus 4 more as a co-author, I feel that doing more research as a postdoc is really unnecessary for me and I want a stable employment instead.

With this pandemic and my recent PTSD diagnosis, I’ve been dealing with dissociation on a daily basis.. days go by without me really noticing, and it has made it challenging to meet deadlines. I’m trying to use reminders, day planers, etc. but even then some days I’m so spaced out that I ignore them or just don’t check-in.. holding myself accountable has been so hard. I’m hoping to get myself into a better routine by going into my office more often (we’ve been encouraged to work from home because of our local restrictions), but I feel agoraphobic and seem to keep pushing off actually going in. 

Ideally I would like to give plenty of notice to my supervisors when I’ll need a letter of reference, but I’ve found myself dropping the ball and leaving it to ~10 days out. There’ve been enough applications now that they have a letter on file for me, but I’m still so embarrassed about asking late (especially when I’ve been slipping on other deadlines too). 

Asking for letters of reference is already a stressful task for me, but this has made it truly painful. I feel the need to explain every detail of my situation, but that’s embarrassing and a bit much. (I feel like every single email I send includes the phrase “sorry for the delay”.)

On the whole I’m an excellent student and have a good rapport with the folks I work with (my main supervisor knows my diagnosis and is supportive, but still hopes for me to achieve a lot), but this seems to be my Achilles heal. 

Does anyone have tips on what to write in these emails? Or more broadly, how to manage deadlines when nothing feels real 24-7? Thanks in advance, I hope you all are staying well!",1,2021-01-21 03:28:38

Maybe it's just the social anxiety and depression, but I honestly feel like a massive burden in my lab. I started in September so my experience has been shaped drastically by COVID. I have been slow to learn techniques because I'm not in the lab much - I did research for 3 years during my undergrad and completed a MSc, so I'm not incompitent, just unfamiliar wth this lab. I haven't had a chance really to bond with my peers because normal social events have been cancelled and we can't meet up for a pint after hours. But there have also been times I've been excluded: birthdays where no one asks me to sign the card or offers a cupcake (and there isn't one left for me either), during lunch they go to a dfferent part of the lab to eat together. Or they sit on their phone and ignore me but will chat with each other when someone else walks in. 

This week, they've started giving me the silent treatment. They don't engage with me unless I directly speak to them. If I have a question, they're too busy to answer it but always have time for each other. Conversations die when I walk by and I'm pretty sure they're talking about me. I feel lke a budern because I think I should be workng more independently by now, but I'm just not getting the training and support I need because everyone is busy and we're at reduced capacity. 

I don't feel lke I can go to my supervisor about any of this. Nothing is outright hostile and I haven't been in an unsafe situaton - yet. And I don't honestly know what she could do. Havng your boss tell you to make friends with someone is hardly going to encourage you to reach out. And I don't want to come off as ""whiny"" or acting lke a child - I already feel like I have to ask for too much hand holding with experiments. Maybe it's  the infamous imposter syndrome, maybe it's not - *I* can't tell. 

So what do I do? I don't need to be BFFs with these people, but I feel like I'm walking on eggshells every day. How do you make friends with new people during a pandemic? Or how do I at least get them to be friendly? Am I breaking some unwritten rules of academia some way? Any kind advice welcome.",41,2021-03-03 17:53:09

lis26d,Desperate-Ratio-377,t2_a77x24am,Living a single life in grad school,"  
Hi people,

I think loneliness is common for single people,  and if they have to indulge into heavy research, at some point, lack of  intimacy will create depression and meaninglessness in the long term making research life miserable and end up wasting the potential. Dating  isn’t easy either, it's not easy to find someone; becomes harder when  you are an ethnic minority in a foreign country for studies. I  struggle with these things and try to improve myself gradually. But yet  I end up watching soft-core pictures or movies or stalking escorts online out of desperation of some intimacy (no I don’t have the courage/luxury to hire an escort for now).   
In my head, I have the images of  legendary scientists who were into research 100%. I know they also had personal lives as well. But things are *very different* today. Now we have so many distractions such as social media, academic emails. For people looking for intimacy, porn can turn out to be a cheap exit which  definitely has a long-term impact to embrace difficult, stressful  situations and deep thinking.

I don't want to whine, but just say it out loud things are hard for young researchers these days. Any thoughts on this, if you struggle(d) with these too, please share how you manage it.

I’m a late bloomer. I’m 22, my parents both died abruptly before I turned 20 (at different times but that’s not super relevant) and as a result I wasn’t able to graduate highschool properly and instead got my GED at 20. I was also diagnosed with ADHD much later in life than most people are (17), and figuring out that I’m not a lazy hopeless dummy has been kind of a journey in itself. Anyway!

I’m hoping in 2020 or 2021 to start school. An endgoal that I’ve had in mind for awhile was that I want to try and develop a standardized therapy for ADHD in the same way that CBT/DBT are the go-tos for things like depression or borderline. I understand that this would probably mean I’d have to pursue more than a bachelors degree.

The rest I’m really not sure about. I’ve tried googling a little but I’m not really sure what questions I should be googling. What should I expect? If I choose to become a researcher, is my income as someone who pursued psychology entirely dependent on getting published? What sorts of career options will be open to me in the event that I spectacularly fuck something up?

capi0c,Bill_Nihilist,t2_aqijs,How can we ethically justify training graduate students?,"My background is in biomedical research, and I'm currently a research scientist, applying for TT positions. I've been struggling with the idea of training my own graduate students and for years now I've been reluctant to encourage undergraduates to continue on to grad school. Every time an undergraduate research assistant has expressed interest in pursuing a PhD, I've tried to explain to them the enormity of the deck stacked against them. To wit:

* Compared to other highly educated people in the general population, PhD students are about [2.5 times](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733317300422) more likely to be at risk for depression and other psychiatric disorders.  About [one in three](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733317300422) end up with symptoms of a psychiatric disorder. 

* For [80%](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0184130) of grad students, an academic career is the goal, but just over [10%](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6286/663) actually achieve a faculty position. And those 10% are not equally distributed across institutions, but disproportionately come from elite institutions [1-3], the kinds of which I will most likely not be teaching at.

* [Most](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6266/1367) biomedical PhDs end up having to do a postdoc, but postdoc [salaries](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00587-y) are lower than that of a new [college graduate](https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/14/pf/college/class-of-2018-starting-salary/index.html) even though the postdoc is working [50+](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/63/4/245/253174) hours per week and is [9](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsf18304/datatables/tab27.htm) years older than the new college grad. 

* [20%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733318302312#sec0030) of postdocs report having existential crises related to their careers.

* If the postdoc goes into industry, their salary ([~$48K/yr](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2015/12/09/350.6266.1367.DC1/aac5949_Zolas-SM.pdf) )  is still less than the median new college grad (~50K/yr) AND it's unlikely the private sector biology PhD will be able to continue doing research [4-5]. Indeed, if the postdoc sticks with research, they can expect to be paid [less](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0241). 

* Moreover, several studies agree that there isn’t any evidence a postdoc will actually benefit seekers of non-academic jobs [6-8]. When comparing private sector workers 10 years post-PhD, the salary of those who went the postdoc route are [$12,000](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3766) lower than those who skipped postdocs altogether. 

So if I encourage someone to go to grad school, I'm essentially putting them on a path toward some pretty dire consequences for their career, especially if they do a postdoc, which most will. If they're not getting paid well, they're not getting training that can help them thrive outside of academia, and they're miserable, how can I justify telling them to go this route? 

I think I'm a pretty good mentor. I think my research is important. But I'm realistic about the prospects of my trainees. They're not all going to end up in tenured faculty positions, and the numbers concerning the alternatives are all pretty grim. I can try my best to make sure my students aren't stressed out horribly, but I can't do anything to ensure they'll have meaningful, fulfilling jobs in science that actually pay enough to make grad school worthwhile. 

So how do you do it? How do we as mentors look our students in the eyes and tell them to ignore the statistics and persevere, hoping they'll be one of the few to buck the trends?

Thank you in advance to anyone who replies to this post.      


Here is the background: I was diagnosed with severe depression two years ago. Last year I started taking medication from my primary doctor to help me manage what I couldn't. My regular monthly appointment was cancelled due to my doctor falling ill and there was no follow up. I contacted my doctor's office the following week to schedule a new appointment and found they had left for vacation for two months. There is no other doctor at the practice and was told to wait it out.     


My decline was gradual and didn't get a wake up call until I was sobbing on my floor and my email was at 900+ unreads.      


My mentor has been trying to contact me but I kept putting it off and now I'm here.     


I'm back on my medication and am trying to pick up the pieces, but I don't know how to apologize. I want to apologize and have it be sincere. I don't want to use my depression as an excuse but my friends are encouraging me to include it in the apology.     


If you've made it this far, I guess I'm looking for advice from other academics on how I should apologize. What should I include and omit? I’m hesitant to talk about this in person because I’m still adjusting to my new meds and cry anytime I think about these past two months. I need to own up to my mistakes so I can move forward and acknowledge all he has done for me, I just don’t know how.",9,2019-07-03 01:15:27

Caveat: This might be in violation of rule 4, but I appreciate your patience; **TLDR**: Skip to the second pgh:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a humanities PhD about to do my fourth year on the job market this fall. Thankfully I have nabbed two consecutive two-year post-docs, so all told, things could be much, *much* worse. I know I'm very fortunate to have benefits and a salary and time to work on my manuscript and don't take it for granted; I have had what a lot of people call unqualified early career success. The problem is that I'm extremely fatigued with moving to places I don't want to necessarily live for the thin hope of staying in a profession that has, in the last few years, sent me into bouts of depression more often than I care to remember. I strongly feel like I can rally if only I can obtain a ""permanent"" (haha) position, or at least I'd like to continue on if only to see if I want to remain in this profession for the long haul. The problem is that it has become increasingly difficult to perform the basic duties of my job (research, revision, course prep, etc.) when I feel like I'm hanging on by a thread all of the time and mired in depression and anxiety (for which I do see a therapist). I'm cynical about academia because of the rampant exploitation and laissez-faire attitudes from higher-rank academics about adjunctification. And, worse, I feel extraordinarily guilty for putting my partner through the hell of being married to an early-career academic.

I guess what I'd like to hear is stories from people in similar situations: how did you manage to compartmentalize or fight through early-career fatigue to stay productive and fulfilled (a question that's probably also relevant to early Asst. Profs, I imagine)? Or, if you've moved on to alt-ac (which I almost did this year if I had gotten the very cool job I was a finalist for), at what point and why did you make the jump? If it's relevant, how did you break out of feeling cynical and disenthused about scholarship and its impact? Who gave you the support you needed and how did you ask for it?",5,2019-07-02 19:41:32
c7m2n7,rhj1989,t2_41w3c83l,(Math) Did I ruin my chances of going to grad school?,"I love mathematics, I've always loved it, and for a long time I could never imagine doing anything else with my life. Going into my senior year of undergrad I had a 4.0 GPA, I had plenty of professors who were willing to write me recommendation letters, things seemed to be going great. But then my depression started getting out of control, things with my living situation deteriorated, I stopped going to my classes, I was hospitalized for suicidal ideation, and after getting out I moved back in with my family. I never withdrew from my classes that last semester, so I now have 5 F's on my transcript. The next couple semesters I tried going back but wasn't really ready and ended up withdrawing.

That was a few years ago. Since then I've just been working, a part-time retail job and a part-time tutoring job at a local community college. I'm doing much better now, my depression is pretty well managed with a combination of medication and regular therapy. Now I want to return to school. I have to petition a board of faculty members for reinstatement but, assuming I get back in and finish my degree (I only need 14 credits), what are my options afterward? Should I even consider grad school at this point? My GPA is shot, my transcript has two semesters of withdrawals on it, and while my old professors may well remember me, it's been a few years so I doubt they would be as eager to give stellar recommendations, especially given that I've accomplished nothing academically over the past three years.

If not grad school, then what should I do? I have a lot of coding experience but I don't know how well I'd be able to compete with people who have comp sci degrees. I don't think I would really enjoy programming as a career, but I don't really have any other marketable skills.

About my background in math, these are the courses I've taken beyond the standard calc and linear algebra sequence: Advanced Calculus I and II, Number Theory, Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometries, Intro to Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Combinatorics, and Intro to Mathematical Logic. If I am able to go back next year, I will likely take Topology, Numerical Analysis, Complex Variables, and a second semester in algebra to finish up my bachelor's.

I'd really appreciate any advice. I'm quite embarrassed about this whole situation so it's very hard for me to reach out for support.",35,2019-07-01 00:59:36

Go figure. Also, this is the UK — we don’t get to try out many things before we start out PhDs/ did very few project components to our degrees, and we typically have to just join one lab from the start — rotations only exist on specific programmes.)

As a result, I turned down some Ivy League postdocs in said field, likely because of pretty severe depression but also because I genuinely wanted to work on something else, having chosen a field that didn’t fit fresh out of undergrad, but knowing how much I enjoyed the bits of my research that weren’t in the lab (smidgens of modelling and theory here and there). The problem was, I didn’t think I was relevant/good enough to apply to things I was interested in because they were more computational/theoretical and I only had an experimental PhD. 

Fast forward a year and I’m doing a postdoc in an experimental lab in the US on something that I don’t really enjoy but I felt would at least make me useful to society. After a very short time when reality hit home (finally moving city will force you to properly assess your life) I realised I had got it all wrong and managed to leave with no hard feelings and the understanding I had erred. 

It’s now a year on; I got lucky and got a job in industry, and it’s ok but I know I can’t really do this forever and not want to go back to research — that would feel like I really have ruined my life. In a way, I have finally managed to recover from the awful depression and rediscover my passion — so it’s horrible to think that it has maybe cost me the thing I am passionate about. In fact, in the process of getting this job I realised how much I can actually do, and to some extent what I am capable of learning, and it really hammered home exactly what it is I am interested in. 

My question is (and sorry for the long post) — have I lost the chance to do research? In a new field that I really care about? 

For some context, I worked in a quantitative field but did mostly experiments for my PhD. I am interested in somewhat computational research/ applied math. I know I can do the math but is anyone likely to take me seriously at this point? Especially since I look so much like I haven’t a clue what I am doing and am in industry to boot?",6,2019-06-30 23:19:43

There is a lot of history of arguing with this PI ever since my experiments kept failing. Here is the latest scenario: I have been behind on my thesis and data collection as I have been dealing with depression thats caused by working in this PI lab. He verbally abuses me frequently and whenever I ask for advice on data he just tells me “to go after it”. I am not completely innocent as its been difficult to find motivation to work in the lab leading to me being behind in data and working late in lab to avoid everyone which he hates. I recently showed data that he didnt like and when I tried to explain it he said he cant support my thesis or read it because it would make him look bad and he basically kicked me out of the lab. There is like 2 weeks left before the defense deadline. I reported the situation to the dean and have a meeting with them tomorrow about the verbal abuse and what happens to my thesis. I originally thought this would allow me to continue with my thesis and graduate so I can leave the lab. However, Im now thinking that its all my fault for not getting the data in the first place and that maybe I dont deserve to defend and will have to start over in a different lab. Am I at fault and need to cut my losses or should I still go to the meeting? Idk what to really say anymore because the PI can use proof of not having “usable data” (which I do now) in my updates to him which makes me look bad and viewed as difficult to work with.",0,2019-06-16 23:52:19
bzh4d7,sombresobriquet,t2_169fy9,Am I making a mistake by not applying for grad school abroad because I'm afraid of homesickness?,"Apologies if the question is inappropriate for this forum. 

Some background - I'm an undergraduate student who just finished the third year of my degree. Although I study in one of the best-ranked universities in India, my country is quite poor and the quality of my education was mediocre, at best.  My degree is in materials science, a subject which is relatively obscure, especially in my country. I am very interested in the field though and I have a good GPA. 

Until the last month, I was 100% adamant that I wanted to go abroad for a master's degree. In January, I was pretty ecstatic when I received an email saying that I'd been selected for a fully funded research internship in Canada. This May, when I arrived in Canada, I experienced a pretty huge culture shock. I've been here for nearly 5 weeks, and I'm facing constant loneliness, depression, and homesickness. I come from an extremely close-knit family and have a long-term girlfriend, so people have told me these feelings are natural. But still, I am starting to doubt my ability to survive abroad for 2-5 years and am seriously considering changing plans and applying for a master's degree in my country or applying for jobs. 

Am I overreacting? Is it a cowardly thing to even consider? I'm really lost at this point and frankly, it's embarrassing admitting this to anyone.",1,2019-06-11 19:38:23
bgtodr,Sajuuk-Cor,t2_1b6moi9,"I struggle with competition in the academic environment, help?","Let's give a little context:

Years ago I always had a goal in mind with my career and I definitely wanted to be an academic in a very specific field. 

During my bachelors degree I met a woman who at first glance was everything I wanted - supremely intelligent, kind, etc... Alas, there was one niggle: she didn't know what she wanted to do in her life / career. 

This caused problems. I had a set goal, but had to work hard to get there. My girlfriend at the time did not have a goal, but vastly surpassed my intellectual capacity and used my own goals as her goals. This introduced a horrible competition to the relationship, mostly from her side, which made it borderline manipulative and caused a rift between us. It's very sad as the outcome could have been the opposite if it was only done in a way that was kind (Think ""power couple"") , pursuing our dreams together etc, but alas it didn't happen. 

In the end, she ended up cheating and I left. I spiralled into a two year episode of pathetic depression and blamed all my failures on her. 

I eventually got over myself and managed to get a PhD in the field of my dreams. All things aside, I should be succeeding and flourishing as an academic, but I'm not. 

A huge part of this is the manifestation of severe imposter syndrome, almost as a form of ptsd from my previous relationship. A lot of my deskmates are competitive, and consistently seek approval from me despite the fact we are in vastly different fields. I compare their comparatively greater success to mine and I end up feeling similar feelings as I did two years ago. 

I ABSOLUTELY want to succeed.

But I feel TRAPPED in a forever endless spiral of self doubt. 

I need to get out of this pit of comparison and realise that my work is individual but I can't stop comparing my progress to that of others. It's absolutely maddening. How on Earth can I fix this?",7,2019-04-24 11:54:22

1. Being able to keep my student job over summer after I graduate. 

2. Having more stability in life.

3. To be able to actually work in the field of psychology. (Eventually)

I don't want to do any reading or writing at all. I don't even really want to do anything else on this PhD and have been thinking about quitting for a long time, except for the fact that I desperately don't want to be 'the one who quit'. I'm conscious that time is passing by and my thesis is due next October 2020 and so far I have NOTHING. 

At first when this started I was in a state of panic and crying every day. Now I feel kind of numb to it all. I am worried of course the time is going by and I'm doing nothing, but I don't care that much about it? I feel in general really unhappy, isolated, losing interest in food, have had no sex drive for months, trouble sleeping/staying asleep.

The thing is that I feel all of this would probably immediately be remedied by quitting my PhD which is why I am questioning if this is actual depression or just burn out. I really don't want to take antidepressants so I haven't been to a doctor yet. And because I feel like if I quit this would all go away, that to me doesn't seem like clinical depression. 

Any advice please? Please be kind; this has been going on for over 6 months and I really feel like I'm at the end of my tether/something has got to give. If there is a way forward with this that doesn't involve taking meds or quitting I would love to hear it.",18,2019-04-01 22:31:29

In particular, my parents refuse to support me on depression treatment, so I need to separate from my parents in order to get treatment (I need new health insurance too).   But it's also bigger than that -- I'm afraid of my parents because of their abusive history, and because they continue to do things like hire a P.I. to stalk my sibling and harass her. I need to separate, but in order to pay rent and expenses by myself I'll need to work full-time (and then some). So I'll need to take at least a year off school.

d3wuvt,Gemini725,t2_3u2gyd0n,Am I Cut Out for Graduate School?," 

I graduated last year with a bachelor's degree in interdisciplinary studies. Until recently, I was 100% sure I wanted to attend graduate school, hoping to first earn an M.A. in American History and then proceed to a Ph.D. I graduated with a 3.93 GPA and 6 graduate level history courses, but I never took more than 12 credits at a time and did not work at all throughout undergrad.

My major setback came during my final undergraduate semester. It was a pretty stressful time for me because I experienced housing insecurity for over half the semester and was moving every few days until my living situation finally stabilized. This happened to coincide with the semester I was taking a graduate level history class not only in the very area I wanted to study but with a professor that I greatly admired. The course included a 25 page (min.) research paper, however, because of my housing situation, I had a much later start on the paper than planned. (I should also mention that I have an anxiety disorder that impairs my ability to handle stress.)

Additionally, I had asked the professor to be my adviser about a month before the semester ended, but after she explained that she was retiring, I fell into a depression which impaired my concentration. Furthermore, I later decided to change topics and had to start from the beginning (which was admittedly petulant, but I was depressed over her not being my adviser). Long story short, I ended up starting the paper less than a week before it was due and it was written in a horrible state of mind. I ended up receiving an A- on it, but there were egregious typos/mistakes and formatting/citation errors. Additionally, it was barely 25 pages (I hoped for something twice that length) and only used about 15 sources which only included 2 books (the rest journal articles). It gets better...the professor actually gave me a one day extension (and then another day), but when she said she ""wasn't pleased"" with having to do it, my depression deepened and I was barely able to concentrate on the revisions. Sometimes I think the final draft was actually worse than the original...

Also, based on her feedback, I could tell that even the A- was given out of sympathy (I got an A in the course), and at that point I doubted that she saw me as graduate school material. (She knew about the housing situation and that I changed topics late in the semester, but she didn't know about my depression \[and it was situation and not clinical\]). Our relationship subsequently soured when I reported her to the department chair for what I perceived was a curt response to another email I sent her as well the fact that she ignored the follow-up email (and also mentioned her saying that she ""wasn't pleased"" etc.) I later tried to apologize for overreacting and explained my anxiety disorder(which is documented) and that I felt depressed that she couldn't be my adviser, but she ignored this email and the next one I sent (both requesting letters of recommendation).

I posted some of this in more detail on the ""Ask Professors of Reddit"" sub, and while the consensus seems to be that I ruined our relationship when I went to the chair, I still can't help but wonder if she simply didn't think I was capable of graduate school because of that paper. While there were extenuating circumstances for it, the fact was that the quality was affected. It seems the type of undergrads that go on to graduate studies are the ones who could write a perfect research paper in one or two nights regardless of how anxious or depressed they're feeling. I tend to be a perfectionist and think it's important to find the right sources, read through them thoroughly etc., but again, maybe I should have been able to do all that within a few days (especially with the extensions) regardless of my state of mind. I'm also starting to question how I would be able to handle the course load of graduate school while simultaneously teaching courses and doing multiple research projects (on top of a thesis) etc. With all that said, I really enjoy research/writing (despite this setback) and still hope to attend, but I want to have a realistic idea of what I'm getting into. Have I been too hard on myself over this paper or does it sound like I might struggle in graduate school? (Again, I""m hoping to start with an M.A. but then go on to a Ph.D.) I would appreciate honest feedback.",0,2019-09-13 22:41:26

However, today I found out that my GPA is still very low, and I feel dread, because I poured all my passion into fixing my past, and now this is my last year Im going to graduate....hopefully, but the dread comes down to the possibility that I wont be able to get into a good university, and I already have one in mind UofH.

How do I handle this situation?,"A junior (though older than I) non-TT colleague has been coming to my office more and more on spontaneous visits and talk to me for hours about all his personal and professional issues. He is in a bind professionally, the university didn't renew his contract and he didn't get any of the other jobs he applied for (though he was being pretty unrealistic in his goals). 

Before this, we were decently good friends, so it seemed normal at first that he would stop by for a chat, let off some steam, and ask for some advice. But he doesn't want my advice, he doesn't respect my need for time to work - he far overstays his welcome (often over an hour, well over) and it is well nigh impossible to get him out of my office without getting a bit visibly mad at him. He is now coming by two or three times a week. I feel like I don't even want to come to work just to avoid this guy.

The real issue, though, is that I found out he has been doing the same thing with other young female colleagues, and worse. He had one who quite senior (though also younger than he by probably about 10 years), who was his sort of advocate and emotional sponge before me. When she tried to distance herself from him, he began coming to her office even more, now to say how hurt and upset he was that she wasn't supporting him when he had done so much for her (I don't really know what). 

He expected her to go to bat for him to get him another contract and when she didn't he came back saying it made contemplate suicide. He texts her constantly about how stressed, sad, depressed, and/or frustrated he is. Even going as far as sending her long emails in the middle of the night about his misery, loneliness, and depression.

I just found out about this and now it makes sense why he is moving on to coming to me more and more as she has set some hard limits with him that have infuriated him. This guy stresses me the fuck out. I got my own problems and they are legion but he never asks me about what is going on with me. He sees a counselor AND a psychiatrist.

Now this is academia and in this institution, you can't just go to HR with your interpersonal issues, the culture of the place is that HR is for real workers and they don't get involved in what they see as just departmental politics unless things get physical or sexual (or you are willing to sue). Also, he already lost the job, he just as four more months on his contract. There really isn't much they can do to him.

I need to get this guy away from me, but I am worried if I piss him off too much he will come after me the way he came after my colleague, I also live just a few blocks away from him and I haven't discounted that he will come to my house.

He is not purely evil, up until I a few months ago I would have considered us pretty good friends and I was even thinking of fixing him up with a friend of mine.

cn82z9,throwaway1_grad,t2_4bkge29l,Grad program chair asked me if I have a learning disability,"This happened a few years ago. I was somehow accepted to a small, well-regarded STEM PhD program after graduating from a subpar undergraduate program (community college -&gt; small satellite campus of a state university). Once I arrived, I didn't do well on my entrance exam. The grad chair of my department expressed disappointment, and asked me on multiple occasions throughout the following semester if I have ADHD and other learning disabilities. I never found a sense of belonging in my program, nor did I find a mentor figure. I lost all motivation to do well, and departed the program the following year.

A few years later, I have found stability via employment. However, this comes after a period of depression due to my grad school experience. I was also homeless for a short while as a result of my depression. Although I have lost all interest in my PhD subject and I doubt I will ever attempt grad studies again, I still spend a lot of time thinking about my experience. Is it common for a PhD student to have zero encouragement/support from faculty in their first year? Was it appropriate for the grad chair to ask me if I have learning disabilities? Should I have done something differently?

I recognize that things could have gone much better if my undergraduate program had been stronger. However, I'm a first generation student from a failing public school system, so I navigated higher ed without a mentor. I don't blame myself entirely for that mistake. 

Also, for the record, I was never found to have a learning disability.",6,2019-08-07 16:34:11

cckvsx,Suspicious_Charge,t2_3n7lsad9,"2 PhDs in the life sciences, how do I get a position that is not a post-PhD entry level?","Dear all,

for the sake of saving the lab (big big name lab) that I was going to as a post-doc from losing a PhD grant application because there was no other student accepting the project (basically they were ghosting the lab and the lab is a very big lab in the field so imagine why) I accepted that I would apply as a PhD student in the lab and there would be no difference between this and junior post-doc.

 I used to be exceptionally gifted in pipetting and technical stuff, very independent with my own ideas and projects and stuff that I was proposing that I would eventually see in top-tier journals (my let's say No1 advisor was declining for money issues pissing me off and making me depressed). 

However, during the process, my supervisor (not the advisor) really was treating me like an inferior (like ACTUAL PHD STUDENT) so we had a lot of conflict. Basically, in this lab all post-docs were fighting passive aggressively one another behind their backs ( tragic irony, my advisor speaks romantically about collaboration and help one another in research while there is blood in his labfloor - I am crying from laughter). Basically also, my supervisor is hated by everyone and is called the secret son of the advisor. Basically in addition, the former post-doc that proposed that I should go to his lab told me specifically not to work with this supervisor because he is an idiot and an as/le.

 For not having trouble with the funding agency I had to unsubscribe from my previous PhD program, so advisor No1 was really pissed off and stopped talking to me - also didn't publish our two papers!!! Eventually, the relationship with the as/e supervisor deteriorated and although I finished my PhD with them, he 1. didn't submit my paper, 2. led me to severe depression from killing parts of my project 3. killed 3 of my collaborations and lied to the advisor (like that I didn't like this project and was asking to join another and all crazy staf!)  4. defamed me as he led me to depression and for a period of time I was not that gifted in pipetting (actually, I didn't want to see a pipette in my life ever again) 5. distorts the truth to everyone,  taking advantage of me not wanting to harm the lab by going to the integrity office and not having enough evidence as well, because I am such an IDIOT that I learnt that you can actually record what is being only discussed and never put on paper at the last year of my ""PhD study"". Yeah, apparently I am such a FOOL!

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am trying to continue in industry - I always wanted industry really, also hated by my advisor for admitting that wahoo!!!!. How do I get a senior position since everyone sees that I am a fresh PhD graduate and without a publication (there will be but according to the as/le's pace). I can't explain the situation for integrity reasons (hahaha)

dhcm8y,sa0cm43ldsw,t2_4sez2tox,Tips for surviving dysfunctional relationship with adviser,"I'm in the fifth year of my program (mathematics) and have been with the same adviser since the beginning. I'm on track to defend at the end of next year. But my relationship with my adviser has become such a mess that I'm not sure what to do. I'm female and he's male, and he's about ten years older than me. (I'm in my late 20's).

It started around the end of my first year: we got very close, very fast, and were in constant communication. It all seemed platonic, but I became more and more dependent on him, and he warned me against forming relationships with other professors in the department. Eventually, I became a pariah in the program, in part, I think, because my adviser and I were so close, and some viewed it as inappropriate.

But during that second year, a pattern started to develop. He would say something negative, or undermining, or downright mean (""Don't embarrass yourself by presenting this paper at that conference."" ""Your work isn't good."" ""You're a poor reflection of me as an adviser."" ""That journal will never accept your article."" \[It did, by the way.\]) I started walking on eggshells around him when it came to certain subjects, because if I got too close to them, he attacked, and it was mean. This pattern has persisted: he says these hurtful things, I get upset, and then he gets mad I'm upset, and tells me I'm the problem, and not him -- he's the ""perfect adviser."" It makes me incredibly depressed. Nothing I do is right in his eyes -- despite performing well professionally, and winning a prestigious award from my university's graduate school.

Ironically, he can be a really good adviser -- very supportive most of the time. He isn't always negative. But the times he is, it sends me into a deep depression. I've even felt suicidal about it, and started therapy and medication. What makes it worst is he has never apologized for the way he behaves, ever. At best, he gives me some sort of gift, or takes me out to lunch, after we have a fight, and pretends like nothing happened.

I don't think any of this is normal, but I can't switch advisers. He seems to get upset when I try to distance myself from him. I don't have any real friends in the department.

dehlyx,fbblue88,t2_r5ulh,Offered a PhD and at a career vs relationship crossroad.,"I am nearly done with my masters and as part of that I applied for some PhD programs. I just heard back from one today and they offered me the spot. However I will likely be saying no for a variety of reasons. 

Career-wise, I thought my ultimate goal was PhD and academia but after my masters I am drained and exhausted from academia. I still feel like I would enjoy the topic of PhD but I don’t want to force myself to jump into a PhD just because “it is the thing I’m supposed to do”. I want to feel the passion for the research and academia going into a project before I jump back in. PhDs are hard as hell and I would rather not go in with a bad mental state, especially considering my history of depression and anxiety. 

From a personal standpoint, I also have a relationship of nearly a year to consider as well. If I take this position then I am putting a lot of miles between my girlfriend (she’s in London and I’d be in Belgium). We would probably only see other once a month if that because of that distance. Right now the relationship is going amazing and I would rather not give it up. Since I am international I have already committed to staying in the UK for my girlfriend (amongst other reasons). I already have a flat and a job lined up in the same city she is working in and we both agree that we want to move in together when in a couple of months when it makes sense. There’s nothing stopping me from doing a PhD in the future and being close to the London area gives me plenty of universities to choose from. 

I posted about this in a relationship focused subreddit and the majority of comments seem to be saying I am holding myself back, etc, etc so I wanted to get the academic perspective. 

Am I saying to no to this offer for the right reasons or do I need a reality check? Does anyone else have a similar experience?",12,2019-10-07 10:30:43
dcx6gu,camilo16,t2_c35wy,I am about to destroy my career and I don't know what to do.,"I always thought I wanted to do research. However after getting my undergrad, I let someone convince me of working for a while instead.  


I found a job and, although the work environment itself was great. The lack of intellectual challenge in the nature of the work started to cause me anxiety. For months I tried to find a solution so I applied to a foreign school because it was the only school that had applications open at the time. I got in, but after budgeting I wouldn't have enough money to live there for the 2 years of the program and chickened out at the last minute.  


This just made my anxiety and depression worse. The lack of intellectual challenge and the prospect of not being able to do research for a really long time was driving me crazy. So I tried reaching out to a professor at a local university to try to do an RA ship. I started doing the RA ship while working, but it now turns out that the RA ship is essentially the same kind of non intellectually challenging work (I am writing documentation and refactoring a code base + fixing bugs). And after talking to the professor, it essentially looks like he feels that just getting a recommendation letter from him to be able to do grad school later on should be what matters to me (he wouldn't be wrong).   


Now I don't know what to do, I am absolutely miserable, I have been crying myself to sleep on and off for the last month. I understand he has done me a great favour. I understand I am being entitled, I understand that all careers have their negatives. But I did this entire thing to do intellectual work, not to get a recommendation letter. I know how entitled this sounds but, I am not even sure I will be able to do a good work. I did this to be able to handle my depression and it only made it worse, I already have a job and money, it's fulfillment that I am lacking.  


Now if I walk away from the RA ship, which is objectively making my quality of life worse, I can say goodbye to any chances of getting into my local university. On the other hand, if I stay I risk not being able to do a good work and still not get a recommendation letter + some more nefarious consequences.  


Maybe I am being a brat, maybe I just don't have the work ethic necessary for this, idk, I don't want to keep destroying my life anymore and do not know what to do. I am sorry if this came off as bratty, it's just the most honest way I can put the way I feel.",0,2019-10-03 21:03:53

dw4w9r,medsciblues,t2_1382ht,Dating a Grad Student,"Hi,

I really hope this isn't as off topic as I hope it is and if it is, please delete but I need to figure out if the grad student I am dating is just putting off time with me because he actually is very busy or because hes just not interested anymore. I keep getting mixed signals.

Now, I will preface this by saying were both in STEM life sciences so I know experiments take a long time. I have had 4 years of undergraduate research in various labs so it is not like I don't know how grad students properly do lab work. I've seen it ranging from 1st years to 5th years. He is a 2nd year. I understand undergrad research is obviously way different than research at the graduate level but I also know (just like with studying), when people say they studied 7 hours, what they mean is 7 hours of distracted studying. I will also say that I know for a fact that the notion is if you're staying in lab for so very long every single day, than perhaps you arent using your time the best you can.

He says hes getting more busy and that he has been falling into slight depression where he has become unmotivated and has been pushing off work but that contradicts what I say in the next paragraph.

So sometimes I will ask him if he wants to do anything and he gives me a response that makes me want to believe him, but also not. He will say how he's busy and has been getting busier (but everyone is busy and I kind of dont want to take that as a excuse because even when you are busy, I know you can make time if you really wanted to, but theres also only 24 hours in a day so I get the struggle) but then he will also try to reschedule with me and part of me thinks people generally would make an effort to reschedule if they wanted to spend time with you. So I just told him to not feel obligated if he's busy and focus on what he has to do after he told me he couldn't spend time after the 3rd time. I think I'm going to let him reach out to me and I'll just accept it if it goes on for too long. Maybe I will get the message.

I really am just asking this sub specifically because I want to get a better idea of ""how busy"" a graduate student is, but also get feedback if he's worth keeping around. I know theres many deadlines and progress reports to PI wants, figures made, manuscripts written, assistance in grant writing, what have you, but I can also list the same responsibilities to mostly anyone. I dont see how the business of a PhD student is any different from anyone else. People normally think undergrads just have the most free time in the world when I think it's the exact opposite if you are doing undergrad the ""right"" way. But again, I am only a senior undergrad and would like other people who have been PhD students or professors to enlighten me a little.

ebjwt1,FabulousOpposite,t2_26w8g9ss,"Planning to leave academia, but afraid of my PI's retaliation. What should I do here?","Using my throwaway.

I'm starting the 3rd year of my 2nd PDF in a STEM lab. Throughout grad school and the first PDF, I didn't know what I wanted to do career-wise. About 18 months ago, I had decided to pursue the academic/faculty route, and even interviewed for a position about a year ago. However, the preparation for, and the interview itself destroyed me, and got me doubting very seriously if academia was really for me. From that point onward, I have slowly but surely made the decision that academia is NOT for me (for lots of a reasons, a few of which I'll outline here), and I am formulating a plan to get out as soon as I can.

For one, I've been struggling with my projects, they are pretty challenging and the last few years have been an endless string of failures. While it's not my first rodeo, and I understand that failure is common in science, I'm not happy anymore being in a career where I don't have satisfaction in regular results. I want to help people, I want to be able to complete projects and make a bigger impact. The pursuit of knowledge and the addition of small bits of data to the collective knowledge of humanity is great, and I'm glad there are people passionate about doing that, but it's just not for me anymore. I will be teaching a bit next term (which I am super excited about), and then moving on as soon as I can, probably to pursue some kind of teaching/science education/communication job.

I am also struggling with depression. I am on medication and am seeing a therapist when necessary. I have not shared this information with my PI, because he has previously belittled those with mental illness and has not shown any signs of understanding, courtesy, or sensitivity in this area. He already shows no genuine interest in his trainees are as people, let alone the struggles they are facing that are possibly having an impact on their job performance.

To add to this, my current lab culture is extremely toxic, and my PI is not a good person. He is vindictive, manipulative, passive-aggressive, anti-social, cruel to his students, and has been known to write bad reference letters to unsuspecting HQP. I am pretty scared of him, and how he will treat me once he knows that I want to leave. He has been known to make someone's life difficult once he knows that they are leaving, piling on extra work, asking for unrealistic tasks to be done in a short time, etc.

So this brings us to now. Recently another PDF had a meeting with him, and he complained about every single person to her. About me, he said that ""The project was hard, and now bchmgal doesn't care, but should really be working harder."" He has not said these things to me, nor has he made any effort to ask how I'm doing personally, how I view my career, what I want moving forward, etc. If this is a huge issue for him and if he is critical of my work style and dedication, he has not told me about it personally.

While I am working and showing up every day, I know I could be working harder. I know because in previous years, I would bust my ass and come in evenings and weekends, and push harder to get things completed and try every possible thing because I CARED. Now that I am mentally checked out and am dealing with depression on top of this, I do what I can accomplish realistically in a regular work week, I know I am being paid and have a duty to do my job, but I'm not passionate and there is no extra effort going in on my part. I live for weekends and evenings where I can forget about my job, and live a happier existence.

**So my problem is this**: In the next 6 months, I will be making active steps to leaving this job. My projects will likely all be half finished and nowhere near the manuscript phase, and he will NOT be happy about this. He will try to convince me to stay longer and make my life difficult until the hour that I leave (there is precedent for this in our group). I am afraid that his reference letter, should I ask him to write one, would allude to the incompleteness of projects, my ""need to care and work harder"", and jumping ship on projects, etc. I could easily ask my PhD advisor and past PDF advisor and other colleagues for reference letters (which they have offered to give knowing what is happening in my current job), but I worry that future employers will wonder why I don't have a reference letter from this current PI. He is very well known and his positive reference would go a long way. Aside from this productivity thing, I know I have been an asset to him, he likes my writing and presentation style, I'm dependable, I've brought in my own money on a prestigious fellowship, etc. 

***TLDR:*** I am mentally checked out of my current job, and despite my best efforts, have been having trouble with my projects (ie. low productivity). My PI has been talking about this behind my back, but not to my face, and has been known to write bad reference letters to unsuspecting trainees. **Should I disclose my reasons for being disengaged (mental illness, desire to leave asap, etc) to address his obvious issues with me, or keep them to myself and risk a crappy reference letter?**",1,2019-12-16 19:34:36

My advisor has been less than helpful and told me give up on the idea of Medical School and not to bother getting a masters. Even when I told her I was getting a masters, she wouldn’t discuss the application process with me and showed me careers instead. 
I recently applied to get my MSW (Master of Social Work) and am applying to the Title IVE program which would pay the tuition and living costs. I did this because I cannot find an enjoyable job with only a BS in Psych. I was thinking I could apply to medical school after my MSW?

TL;DR: I screwed up my undergrad GPA and didn’t finish taking premed courses. Applied to MSW and don’t know what to do next.

Any advice on where to go from here in order to receive acceptance from a medical school in the future? Anything to help me get in? Is it unrealistic to apply at all?",1,2019-12-09 17:01:12
e6lhor,sofizzati,t2_12tx1xn6,Deferral due to depression,"How should I write a letter to my faculty to state that I would like to defer &amp; get special consideration? 

Their counselors are of no help, really. I broke down and was pleading for help on the e-counselling section that my uni offers. His replies were SO unhelpful, and I wasn't the only one who thought so. He basically said ""Okay, cool."" in the longest way possible and told me to go get help from a therapist instead. He told me to get medical reports from my doctor and therapist.

I went to therapy and she said that I wasn't going long enough for her to actually write one and needed 3-4 more sessions until she could help. Which is fair. My fourth session is soon and I hope she could write it asap, because my next semester starts in a month. 

I suffer from PCOS which affects me quite a bit, messing with my hormones, making me gain weight, and pushes me further down the depressing pit of.. depression. My gynae said she wasn't going to write me a medical report because it didn't make sense for her to do so and that my hypertension was a more ""severe"" illness. Fine, fair enough.

Having denied one medical report and one more is still processing, sort of, I have serious anxiety issues about asking my GP for one as I literally just newly discovered of my hypertension. I've gone twice or thrice to the GP and they've confirmed me of hypertension but no medications are given. Which stresses me out even more. 

I've spent so much money on this therapist and what if her medical report is just.. not enough? What if my GP won't write me a medical report? 

What would I put in my deferral request letter?

I messed up my whole semester last month because I was so depressed I couldn't for the life of me leave my bed, what more drive an hour to go to class and an hour more back? My groupmates didn't include my name in the final project because some days I couldn't cooperate, but every, single, time I texted them, each and everyone of them would blatantly ignore me. I even straight up asked the group leader if I was still in the group and he didn't even have the decency to tell me no. Ignored, ignored, and ignored. Not soon after that, I was barred for half of my subjects. At that point, I gave up. Every single time I did make it to class, I would cry in the car before going, during breaks, and after. It was so damn traumatizing I couldn't even push through to my final exams of the subjects I wasn't barred for. 

Did I mention I'm under a scholarship from the uni? I am. And if I lose it, I can't afford it. I don't know what to do. 

I want to defer because I need to get my health in check. Both mentally and physically, I am a mess. I love learning. Before this degree, I graduated with a 3.8CGPA for my pre-U. But this uni has broken me with its rude lecturers, and unhelpful peers. One lecturer actually shouted at me that I ""didn't have any problems"" because, quoting her, ""you don't have to go home to kids and you don't have to wash their a\*\*, do you? So what is wrong with you? go see someone because clearly there's something wrong with you. Honestly, just quit architecture"" and another that went ""you'd probably just finish this degree, get married, and never practice it again, so why does it matter that I give you a poor performance report, right?""

Alright, enough of that. Sorry. Those were a few moments etched in my memories that will probably continue to hurt me for life but eh, that's nothing. The real problem right now is how do I save my life by deferring and somehow save my scholarship even though i failed my last semester through this one letter? help.",1,2019-12-05 18:41:59
exbe41,ai_research_purposes,t2_3d45q68c,Advice on how to manage and distribute work as a project grows?,"Hey r/GradSchool! I'm a 1st year 2nd semester MSc student in Computer Engineering working on bio-signal processing. 

Roughly half a year ago, when I joined the lab in new graduate institution, I got into this new project which is pretty much unrelated to most work my PI does (mostly HPC, Computer Architecture and Optimization and the like). I guess he wanted to diversify his research areas and since me and the others (3 of us, including me: 2 MSc, 1 undergrad) had more experience on signal processing than on CA and the low-level work everyone else on the lab worked on it would be a great opportunity to dive into this field which has gotten a lot of attention in the recent years.

At the beginning I was struggling with depression and a heavy breakup which combined with the fact that at the beginning I wasn't so on board with the idea of continuing graduate studies after undergrad (I was burned out and wanted to get a job in industry) and some classes which were pretty difficult for me (I studied MechEng not CS as undergrad so I have had to put a huge amount of effort to catch up with my peers) almost made me quit halfway through the semester but through friends, family and his support I managed to keep everything under control and finish the semester outstandingly.

During all of this time I've been slowly getting more and more into this project, to the point a few weeks ago I was working on it for 12 or more hours 7 days a week. I went from barely understanding the core concepts to conceptualizing my own new research contributions, while coordinating and organizing the small group efforts for the short and long term while reporting back to my PI.

In terms of actual research our methodology has been to begin from opensource code, implement (what we believe is) SOTA and our own contributions to it and hopefully try to publish in some big DIP/CV Conference/Journal.

My main concern is as the project grows it's gotten to a point I feel it cannot be handled by a group of three people anymore. I sometimes feel overworked since I have to do a manager, communicator, low-level scripting, medium-level data analysis and high-level algorithm implementation programming jobs, while keeping up to date with SOTA literature and coming up/putting in practice my own contributions. Asides from this since I mentioned I don't have lots of CS fundamentals I also need to consume quite a lot of background knowledge I don't have but will probably require somewhere down the road (Data Structures/Algorithms/Operating Systems/Computer Architecture/Information Theory).

I proposed to my PI to recruit more students by communicating we're working on this field, since as I mentioned, no one knows we're working on this since it's pretty far from everything the PI currently does. I have come up my own set ideas to garner interest from potential students (publishing in top conferences being my best bet, but local expositions of our work is another option, among others) and recently he also told me recruited 2 new students which should join our group once the next academic year starts, roughly half a year later, and that I should begin incorporating them into our online discussions and put them up-to-date with our work.

I'm glad because this shifts some of the responsbilities I currently have onto others, but at the same time I feel scared since sometimes I realize there's so many things I don't know about this field and if it crashes and collapses it's all going to be my fault. The other day I found a paper from 2012 which covered something slighly similar to something I had proposed months ago which I thought was novel. There's probably many other examples of how the lit survey I'm doing is lacking and I'm absolutely not qualified for this. I feel bad since I asked for more students and now their research projects/thesis are on my hands and I'm scared I'm going to bring everyone down with me. With this in mind, I would like to know if anyone has any experience on this, organically growing a project and how to distribute work while making sure the ship is in the right track, that can share ANYTHING that would help with this. Sorry for the block of text.

TL;DR: MSc student on charge of new bio-signal project unrelated to PI's previous work (HPC). Scared of dragging down everyone involved. Need help with suggestions on how to deal with the growing project.",1,2020-02-01 19:40:03

esvte3,devsmess,t2_11776h,Burnout - 30/f College and Work,"I hope this is the right place to post this. I need help, and I don't know who to ask for advice.

I'm taking the GRE tomorrow morning, and my graduate applications are due at the end of the month. I thought that the crippling stress would lessen when those tasks were complete, but I know I'm wrong. The next three to four months will be filled with full-time work (between two jobs), and nine credits worth of hard science courses. I don't own a car, and finances are really tight. I'm not even applying to one of the colleges I'd like to go to because I don't have the money--I'll just be applying to one--but I've made peace with that. My commute is long, over an hour each way with a mix between bike and light rail, and the only time I'll have 'off' is Sunday and Monday morning, in which I'll have to go food shopping, prep my food for the week, do laundry, go to the bank, clean the house, and do the homework for the week. 

I feel like I'm going to throw up. I can't do it. I don't know how it's possible for me to do it, but I also don't know how to change it. I need to work to afford my bills, but I also need to take these two classes to get into grad school. I will have no time for anything at all, not even my fiancee, who already has a worse commute than me and is out of the house for almost as long. I will barely be able to save anything to move to the graduate college are if I do get in. 

But I'm 30. I don't want to slog through minimum wage jobs for the rest of my life. It's already unbearable. I don't feel like I can postpone any of this without giving up hope. I've been low for a long time. 

What can I do? My dream has always been to get my doctoral degree and be in research, either at a university or museum, or work for the state... and eventually become a professor. I can't imagine my life without that goal. But my stress is so high that I feel like giving up on life in general. I've even started taking anxiety/depression meds a few weeks ago because I feel like I'm dying. Brain-fog, nausea, not getting out of bed, I can't make a single decision... I feel hopeless. 

How do I solve this problem? I'm going to burnout if I keep this schedule. I just want to be great in my field, but I won't even be able to focus on learning if I do this... but how will I make money???

Jesus, I'm shaking. I don't know what to do. Sorry if this is more venting than anything. I want to quit the world right now.",1,2020-01-23 16:53:23
eq9hb0,semanticcontempt,t2_56tdmlp1,"I completely abandoned an independent study/research project as sophomore. Now that I'm about to graduate, do I try to make things right?","Hi there, sort of a throwaway but actually just my first reddit account. 

tl;dr: A prof took a chance on me and I totally blew it. Do I try to make contact with that prof to make amends and finish my project?

As the title states, as a Sophomore student I was given a (humanities) research study / internship where I would work under my professor doing textual research. The idea was that by the end of the year, I would produce a paper with my professor geared towards publication. This came with a small stipend through a grant. I applied for this grant with a professor I particularly bonded with and was accepted during my freshman year, and the work officially began my sophomore fall semester. 

But that... never really happened. 

Where exactly I screwed up isnt super clear even to me, but basically it comes down to a mix between immaturity, procrastination, unreliability and disorganization. Sophomore year was probably my worst year in terms of depression and anxiety, caused or at least exacerbated by being in a very hectic relationship and frequent drug and alcohol abuse. I've always had a very hard time staying organized, focused, attentive, etc., and if that rings any bells yes I have recently been seeing a therapist for concerns of ADHD/ADD. No diagnosis yet, but my therapist believes I fit all the signs and Im hoping to get tested as soon as I get the funds. 

All this culminated at the time with me really getting nowhere with this project. Meetings with my prof were irregular and infrequent, both because of my fear of showing my lack of work, and also because they are also (seemingly) a very scattered person and would cancel/forget as often as I. I didnt work independently, instead I spent my time (barely) focusing on my classes, playing games, abusing drugs and living as a complete mess. My relationship at the time was taking a turn a loooong for the worse for these same reasons and by the end of junior year was over. 

I never did get out any sort of paper, though I did do enough research to be able to throw together a poster and present it at the undergrad symposium. My professor did not attend. 

There was a research credit attached to this project, and I was given an incomplete in hopes I would be able to finish within several months. But again, that didnt happen. My situation and attitude the next summer and my Junior year was not much better, and I completely avoided so much as running into this prof in the hallways. My shame and fear started to grow into this bolus that rotted in my stomach. The longer I did nothing, the more guilt I felt about it, which made me fearful to even begin, etc. Yeah, I was and still am kind of pathetic. Junior year ended, and the I on my transcript became an F. 

Now I'm finishing my 5th year as an undergraduate, and I'm doing much better for myself. I have a job at a STEM lab on campus, I tutor on the side, I'm doing a lot better in my classes. More importantly, I feel much more stable in my living situation, hobbies/habits, mental state and overall life. Im working hard, avoiding bad habits, and feeling comfortable in my own skin for the first time in my life. 

So, with 1 semester left to graduate (though ill be going to grad school at my same institution in the fall), do I try to right my wrong? I obviously really disappointed a prof who was willing to take a chance on me and honestly I really adored. I really disappointed myself, of course. And the subject matter does indeed interest me! I feel much more able to take on this project, both in terms of my scope of knowledge and life habits. There is also a course on this very topic the prof is teaching currently, and so I do have a less righteous reason of wanting to take their class again aswell. 

What say you reddit? Should I come with some work already done to show I won't fail a second time? Do I simply talk to them first, before anything else? And if so, how do I make my apology? Would I be doing this for the right reasons, or am I just opening up old wounds in an attempt to make myself feel less guilty about the past? Thanks for reading.",1,2020-01-18 00:56:31

enitok,fleemfleemfleemfleem,t2_485hniyq,What questions and answers would you include in an FAQ?,"What questions and answers would you include in an FAQ?

Here are some of the questions and popular answers I've seen here a number of times. What questions and answers would you add?

**FAQ**

**Publishing**

-   Can I publish without an academic affiliation

    -   This is a qualified yes. It’s much more difficult to publish without an institutional affiliation, especially if you are a true outsider to academia. For one thing, journals often have fees in the hundreds or thousands of dollars to publish. Another aspect to consider is that academic publishing has incredibly high standards. It’s difficult to learn and understand these expectations and standards if you haven’t been trained in academia. It’s a part of the “soft curriculum” that you learn in graduate school.
-   How do I access articles outside of a university?


-   Publishing companies make money both by charging fees to download articles, charging university libraries for subscriptions, and by charging academics to publish. You can request a “reprint” for free from one of the authors of the article, and they will generally send you a copy for free. There is also a legally grey area of using scihub to access articles.
-   Why does this publisher want things in such an archaic format?

    -   They were sold software 15 years ago, and never bothered to upgrade. They also don’t often submit to their own journal so they aren’t aware of how odd it would be to include a fax number, or send typewritten pages.
-   How often should I be publishing at (career stage)?

    -   This is entirely dependent on your sub-field. Look at people who have the job you want and see how often the were publishing when at your stage.
-   How do you track citations when writing an academic article?

    -   There are a number of software packages designed for this ranging from free to quite expensive, and which you use depends on where you find your articles, and what software you use for word processessing, as well as what your collaborators and co-authors have standardized on. Endnote is often available as an institutional subscription. Many use free options such as zotero or mendelay. If you like to write in google docs, Paperpile is a good option. Options are different still, if you use LaTeX.
-   How important is impact factor, or other metrics to selecting a journal?

    -   It depends on your field and career stage. IF matters more prior to tenure, or job search.
-    How do I select a journal to publish in?

    -   Experience. What journals published the papers you cited in the article?
-   How important is publishing as a PhD student?

    -   Generally speaking, very. Some fields have different requirements, though. Some might expect that PhD research would generate a book at an academic press. Others might expect 1-6 papers in decent peer reviewed journals in your field. You find out by asking your adviser for their expectations.
-   I changed my name when I got married/transitioned. Should I continue to publish under my old name, or start publishing under my new name?

    -   Unfortunately the academic publishing system was largely designed in a period when most academics were men who did not change their names at marriage. This can make it difficult to track an academic’s publications when they change their last name. Some change names, and simply list all their publications on their google scholar, CV, or other publication list. Others continue to use their pre-marriage or pre-transition name on publicaitons. This is a personal choice.
-   My adviser published my work after I left the group, and (included my name without permission/did not include my name). What is my recourse?

    -   Start by contacting your former adviser. You can escalate to an ombudsperson or an editor at the journal.

**Conferences**

-   How much of my conference time should be spent working?

    -   At least most of it. Make sure to attend at least some events each day. You can go to dinner at night, or take a day to explore the city you’re visiting, but you’re mostly there to work.
-   Do conferences go on your CV?

    -   This is field dependent. In some fields such as computer science conference publications are a more important unit of academic productivity than they are in others. Look at the CV of someone else in your field, and see how they organize them.
-   I have never been to a conference before, what should I expect?

    -   Travel early so that you have time to get relax before the conference itself. Conferences are overwhelming. Get to your hotel, change into clean clothes, watch some TV, then head over to registration.
    -   Don’t feel you have to go to every session.
    -   Asking questions at talks is an important way to become recognizable to more established researchers in your field. Likewise going to poster sessions and meeting and talking to lots of people is a great way to make connections and get to know younger people in your field.
    -   If you get the chance make some conference friends. It’s very rewarding to have people that you look forward to seeing every year.
-   I’m nervous about speaking, how do I prepare?

    -   Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse. Rope people into a practice talk. Make sure that your have the introduction and conclusion down pat. Make sure that every slide is simplified to: an image, and maybe one or two explanatory lines. No one wants to read giant text blocks. Have **one** big idea per slide.
-   How do I “network” at a conference?

    -   The word networking is intimidating, but really its just talking to people. Ask questions after talks, approach people at posters and ask questions or compliment them. Go to the dinners and sit next to strangers. Bring business cards to hand out with your name and academic affiliation.

**Dissertations**

-   Is it normal to feel ‘empty’ after defending my dissertation?

    -   Yes, this is very common. The phenomenon goes by several names. Post achievement depression, success hangover, or the arrival fallacy. The arrival fallacy is the fallacious belief that you will achieve happiness when some goal is reached. As you approach that goal, you have already included those accomplishments in your perception of the world, so the new achievement just seems status quo. Learn to celebrate your accomplishments, regardless of that feeling.
-   How do I select a dissertation topic?

    -   You should be having regular meetings with your adviser and committee, and they should be helping you develop your research. If your project has already gone through peer review several time by the time you defend, it will be difficult for your committee to turn it down.
-   What happens if I fail?

    -   You need to listen to your adviser and committee. They won’t propose that you defend until they know you’ll pass. A failing student is an embarrassment, that they don’t want. For the most part the only students who fail are the ones who ignore the advise of their committee and defend too early.

**Relationships**

-   Should I date (a faculty member/a student)?

    -   No. Generally speaking this kind of relationship is a bad idea. There are inherent power imbalances in a relationship between people who work together, but have different ranks. It’s especially bad if one advises the other, or teaches them in a class. Look up the faculty handbook for your university for the specific rules regarding faculty/student relationships. Some forbid it expressly, some discourage it, some forbid it if one is in a direct position of power over the other.
    -   Others will advise you to follow your heart when you find the opportunity. Each situation is unique, and the best you can do use to use whatever your best judgment is, being fully aware of the potential consequences.
-   When is the right time to have kids?

    -   There is no ‘good time.’ Do it when it feels right for you and your partner, and make your academic life work around it. Life is happening now, not at some indeterminable point in the future.
-   Should I ask out my labmate/coworker

    -   Always ask yourself: “If this goes south and I still have to work with this person after the breakup, how will we both feel?” Also “If he or she rejects me, will I be too embarrassed to work with them in the future.

**Plagiarism**

-   My (paper/dissertation) was plagiarized, what do I do?

    -   Contact the journal editor and report the plagiarism. If you need to escalate go to an ombudsperson at their university or their chair.
-   I was caught plagiarizing, what do I do?

    -   Show genuine contrition, and convince the people punishing you that you’ve learned why what you did was wrong, and will never do it again.
-   My student plagiarized, what do I do?

    -   Look up your university policy on academic dishonesty. See what you wrote in your syllabus. Before you act, make sure you have evidence that proves the cheating. Administration won’t always take your side, so make sure you have all your ducks in a row before punishing a student for academic dishonesty.

**Sexual Harassment**

-   I am being sexually harassed by another student, a colleague, my adviser, or someone else.

    -   First make sure that you are safe.
    -   In the US you should go to your university’s title IX officer, and report the harassment. They will help you with next steps and who to contact.
-   My adviser acts weird around me, but it hasn’t risen to the level of sexual harassment, what can I do?

    -   Communicate to them what’s making you uncomfortable. Barring that, have a discussion with a neutral party in the university.
-   I was at a conference/after work party and people were acting weird. What can I do?

    -	Communicate what made you uncomfortable.

**Correspondence**

-   How do I write to a professor? Will it annoy them?

    -   Use a formal letter format with their title, and a salutation at the end. Use good grammar, and address them by their earned academic title or position. If they hold a PhD, do not refer to them as Mr. Ms. Or Mrs. If you are unsure, “professor” is fine, even if they are an adjunct.
        Dear Dr. X:
        Sincerely, Y
-   This person isn’t answering my emails in a timely manner, how often can I follow up?

    -   Some people are just really, really bad at email. Worst case scenario you may have to stop by their office during office hours. Don’t go to their house or call their home phone.
-   Is it okay to write to this person and ask them for x?

    -   Generally speaking, it can’t hurt to ask. The worst someone can say is no.

**Job Search/Applications**

-   The referent for my applications hasn’t submitted their letter of recommendation and there are only a few days remaining, what do I do?

    -   It’s not uncommon for referents to wait until the last minute to submit a letter. It is reasonable to send a reminder a few days before the letters are due. Committees usually recognize that letters are out of your hands, so they should be okay with someone who gets the letter in late.
-   Should I ask (x) person for a letter?

    -   Make sure it’s someone who knows you well, and will remember you. Someone you saw often in office hours or worked with on a project. If they say “I don’t know that I can write you a great letter.” That’s a sign to look for someone else.
    -   It helps when asking for a letter to pre-write a draft letter about yourself for them to modify and then submit. This seems weird, but it makes it 1000x easier for the person writing the letter.
-   A student asked me for a letter, but I don’t remember them, or can’t give them a good recommendation, what do I do?

    -   Gently suggest that they would be better off going to someone else for a letter.
    -   If they don’t get the message, tell them in clear terms that you won’t write them a good letter.
    -   Don’t write a negative letter. This can result legal liability, and it isn’t fair to the student. Don’t even do the “damning faint praise” thing. Send them to someone who can recommend them.
-   How many jobs should I be applying to?

    -   Many academic jobs get 100-200 applications for a single spot. You may need to put in this many applications to get a single spot. The most openings are usually in the late summer or fall. Start more than a year before you’ll be on the market and create your basic application. Apply to *everything* that even remotely fits your needs. The process can be dehumanizing, and not every committee will write back with a no.
    -   Create a spreadsheet to keep track of jobs you’re interested in, which you’ve applied to, what the deadlines are, and if you’ve received invitations to phone interview, in person interview, or received an offer.
-   What should I expect on a phone interview?

    -   You’ll be on a conference call with the committee. They’ll ask you at least:

        -   Why our school?
        -   When would you be able to start?
        -   Would you be happy in (location)?
    -   They may ask

        -   About your teaching philosophy
        -   A lay rundown of your research
        -   Your grant plan over the next three years
        -   Ballpark startup needs
        -   Who in the department you might see being able to collaborate with.
    -   You should prepare for the phone interview by writing out answers to those questions, and printing out and having in front of you:

        -   Profiles of anyone you know is on the hiring committee
        -   The mission statement of the university
        -   Questions for the committee
    -   Safe questions for the committee give them a chance to brag and don’t embarrass them

        -   Ask about the department environment
        -   Ask what distinguishes their students
        -   Ask what they think you should know that you haven’t asked
        -   Ask about the promotion and tenure processes

-   What should I expect from an in person interview

    -   At least a day of rapid fire 30-minute interviews with everyone in the department
    -   At least one dinner with the entire committee, or chair
    -   A talk which may be research, a teaching demonstration, or a combination of these
    -   A formal meeting and interview with the hiring committee.
    -   A possible meeting with the dean
    -   Keep in mind that you are being interviewed from the second you get off of the airplane. You need to be “on” the entire time, and don’t let your guard down to drink too much at dinner.
-   How many graduate programs should I apply to

    -   Usually 9-12 is a good number, depending on your field, background, and what you can afford.
-   How do I choose an adviser?

    -   One important thing that’s often overlooked is talking to other students. Ask what they’re like to work with. Ask if they’re a creep. Ask how long other students have taken to graduate. Make sure they don’t have anger issues. Ask if you can see what some of their previous advisees have gone on to do.",1,2020-01-12 04:23:35
enireh,fleemfleemfleemfleem,t2_485hniyq,What questions and answers would you include in an FAQ?,"What would you include in an FAQ? 

I made a list of some questions I seen asked and answered pretty often on this sub. What would you add, or change?

**FAQ**

*Publishing*

    • Can I publish without an academic affiliation
        ◦ This is a qualified yes. It’s much more difficult to publish without an institutional affiliation, especially if you are a true outsider to academia. For one thing, journals often have fees in the hundreds or thousands of dollars to publish. Another aspect to consider is that academic publishing has incredibly high standards. It’s difficult to learn and understand these expectations and standards if you  haven’t been trained in academia. It’s a part of the “soft curriculum” that you learn in graduate school. 
    • How do I access articles outside of a university?
        ◦ Publishing companies make money both by charging fees to download articles, charging university libraries for subscriptions, and by charging academics to publish. You can request a “reprint” for free from one of the authors of the article, and they will generally send you a copy for free. There is also a legally grey area of using scihub to access articles. 
    • Why does this publisher want things in such an archaic format?
        ◦ They were sold software 15 years ago, and never bothered to upgrade. They also don’t often submit to their own journal so they aren’t aware of how odd it would be to include a fax number, or send typewritten pages. 
    • How often should I be publishing at (career stage)?
        ◦ This is entirely dependent on your sub-field. Look at people who have the job you want and see how often the were publishing when at your stage.
    • How do you track citations when writing an academic article?
        ◦ There are a number of software packages designed for this ranging from free to quite expensive, and which you use depends on where you find your articles, and what software you use for word processessing, as well as what your collaborators and co-authors have standardized on. Endnote is often available as an institutional subscription. Many use free options such as zotero or mendelay. If you like to write in google docs, Paperpile is a good option. Options are different still, if you use LaTeX. 
    • How important is impact factor, or other metrics to selecting a journal?
        ◦ It depends on your field and career stage. IF matters more prior to tenure, or job search. 
    •  How do I select a journal to publish in? 
        ◦ Experience. What journals published the papers you cited in the article?
    • How important is publishing as a PhD student?
        ◦ Generally speaking, very. Some fields have different requirements, though. Some might expect that PhD research would generate a book at an academic press. Others might expect 1-6 papers in decent peer reviewed journals in your field. You find out by asking your adviser for their expectations. 
    • I changed my name when I got married/transitioned. Should I continue to publish under my old name, or start publishing under my new name?
        ◦ Unfortunately the academic publishing system was largely designed in a period when most academics were men who did not change their names at marriage. This can make it difficult to track an academic’s publications when they change their last name. Some change names, and simply list all their publications on their google scholar, CV, or other publication list. Others continue to use their pre-marriage or pre-transition name on publicaitons. This is a personal choice.
    • My adviser published my work after I left the group, and (included my name without permission/did not include my name). What is my recourse?
        ◦ Start by contacting your former adviser. You can escalate to an ombudsperson or an editor at the journal. 

*Conferences*

    • How much of my conference time should be spent working? 
        ◦ At least most of it. Make sure to attend at least some events each day. You can go to dinner at night, or take a day to explore the city you’re visiting, but you’re mostly there to work. 
    • Do conferences go on your CV?
        ◦ This is field dependent. In some fields such as computer science conference publications are a more important unit of academic productivity than they are in others. Look at the CV of someone else in your field, and see how they organize them. 
    • I have never been to a conference before, what should I expect? 
        ◦ Travel early so that you have time to get relax before the conference itself. Conferences are overwhelming. Get to your hotel, change into clean clothes, watch some TV, then head over to registration. 
        ◦ Don’t feel you have to go to every session. 
        ◦ Asking questions at talks is an important way to become recognizable to more established researchers in your field. Likewise going to poster sessions and meeting and talking to lots of people is a great way to make connections and get to know younger people in your field. 
        ◦ If you get the chance make some conference friends. It’s very rewarding to have people that you look forward to seeing every year. 
    • I’m nervous about speaking, how do I prepare?
        ◦ Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse. Rope people into a practice talk. Make sure that your have the introduction and conclusion down pat. Make sure that every slide is simplified to: an image, and maybe one or two explanatory lines. No one wants to read giant text blocks. Have one big idea per slide.
    • How do I “network” at a conference?
        ◦ The word networking is intimidating, but really its just talking to people. Ask questions after talks, approach people at posters and ask questions or compliment them. Go to the dinners and sit next to strangers. Bring business cards to hand out with your name and academic affiliation.

*Dissertations*

    • Is it normal to feel ‘empty’ after defending my dissertation?
        ◦ Yes, this is very common. The phenomenon goes by several names. Post achievement depression, success hangover, or the arrival fallacy. The arrival fallacy is the fallacious belief that you will achieve happiness when some goal is reached. As you approach that goal, you have already included those accomplishments in your perception of the world, so the new achievement just seems status quo. Learn to celebrate your accomplishments, regardless of that feeling.
    • How do I select a dissertation topic? 
        ◦ You should be having regular meetings with your adviser and committee, and they should be helping you develop your research. If your project has already gone through peer review several time by the time you defend, it will be difficult for your committee to turn it down. 
    • What happens if I fail?
        ◦ You need to listen to your adviser and committee. They won’t propose that you defend until they know you’ll pass. A failing student is an embarrassment, that they don’t want. For the most part the only students who fail are the ones who ignore the advise of their committee and defend too early. 

*Relationships*

    • Should I date (a faculty member/a student)?
        ◦ No. Generally speaking this kind of relationship is a bad idea. There are inherent power imbalances in a relationship between people who work together, but have different ranks. It’s especially bad if one advises the other, or teaches them in a class. Look up the faculty handbook for your university for the specific rules regarding faculty/student relationships. Some forbid it expressly, some discourage it, some forbid it if one is in a direct position of power over the other. 
        ◦ Others will advise you to follow your heart when you find the opportunity. Each situation is unique, and the best you can do use to use whatever your best judgment is, being fully aware of the potential consequences. 
    • When is the right time to have kids?
        ◦ There is no ‘good time.’ Do it when it feels right for you and your partner, and make your academic life work around it. Life is happening now, not at some indeterminable point in the future. 
    • Should I ask out my labmate/coworker
        ◦ Always ask yourself: “If this goes south and I still have to work with this person after the breakup, how will we both feel?” Also “If he or she rejects me, will I be too embarrassed to work with them in the future. 

*Plagiarism*

    • My (paper/dissertation) was plagiarized, what do I do?
        ◦ Contact the journal editor and report the plagiarism. If you need to escalate go to an ombudsperson at their university or their chair. 
    • I was caught plagiarizing, what do I do?
        ◦ Show genuine contrition, and convince the people punishing you that you’ve learned why what you did was wrong, and will never do it again.
    • My student plagiarized, what do I do?
        ◦ Look up your university policy on academic dishonesty. See what you wrote in your syllabus. Before you act, make sure you have evidence that proves the cheating. Administration won’t always take your side, so make sure you have all your ducks in a row before punishing a student for academic dishonesty. 

*Sexual Harassment*

    • I am being sexually harassed by another student, a colleague, my adviser, or someone else. 
        ◦ First make sure that you are safe. 
        ◦ In the US you should go to your university’s title IX officer, and report the harassment. They will help you with next steps and who to contact. 
    • My adviser acts weird around me, but it hasn’t risen to the level of sexual harassment, what can I do? 
        ◦ Communicate to them what’s making you uncomfortable. Barring that, have a discussion with a neutral party in the university. 
    • I was at a conference/after work party and people were acting weird. What can I do?
        ◦ 
*Correspondence*

    • How do I write to a professor? Will it annoy them?
        ◦ Use a formal letter format with their title, and a salutation at the end. Use good grammar, and address them by their earned academic title or position. If they hold a PhD, do not refer to them as Mr. Ms. Or Mrs. If you are unsure, “professor” is fine, even if they are an adjunct.
    • This person isn’t answering my emails in a timely manner, how often can I follow up?
        ◦ Some people are just really, really bad at email. Worst case scenario you may have to stop by their office during office hours. Don’t go to their house or call their home phone.
    • Is it okay to write to this person and ask them for x?
        ◦ Generally speaking, it can’t hurt to ask. The worst someone can say is no. 

*Job Search/Applications*

    • The referent for my applications hasn’t submitted their letter of recommendation and there are only a few days remaining, what do I do?
        ◦ It’s not uncommon for referents to wait until the last minute to submit a letter. It is reasonable to send a reminder a few days before the letters are due. Committees usually recognize that letters are out of your hands, so they should be okay with someone who gets the letter in late. 
    • Should I ask (x) person for a letter?
        ◦ Make sure it’s someone who knows you well, and will remember you. Someone you saw often in office hours or worked with on a project. If they say “I don’t know that I can write you a great letter.” That’s a sign to look for someone else. 
        ◦ It helps when asking for a letter to pre-write a draft letter about yourself for them to modify and then submit. This seems weird, but it makes it 1000x easier for the person writing the letter.
    • A student asked me for a letter, but I don’t remember them, or can’t give them a good recommendation, what do I do?
        ◦ Gently suggest that they would be better off going to someone else for a letter.
        ◦ If they don’t get the message, tell them in clear terms that you won’t write them a good letter.
        ◦ Don’t write a negative letter. This can result legal liability, and it isn’t fair to the student. Don’t even do the “damning faint praise” thing. Send them to someone who can recommend them. 
    • How many jobs should I be applying to?
        ◦ Many academic jobs get 100-200 applications for a single spot. You may need to put in this many applications to get a single spot. The most openings are usually in the late summer or fall. Start more than a year before you’ll be on the market and create your basic application. Apply to everything that even remotely fits your needs. The process can be dehumanizing, and not every committee will write back with a no. 
        ◦ Create a spreadsheet to keep track of jobs you’re interested in, which you’ve applied to, what the deadlines are, and if you’ve received invitations to phone interview, in person interview, or received an offer. 
    • What should I expect on a phone interview?
        ◦ You’ll be on a conference call with the committee. They’ll ask you at least:
            ▪ Why our school?
            ▪ When would you be able to start?
            ▪ Would you be happy in (location)?
        ◦ They may ask
            ▪ About your teaching philosophy
            ▪ A lay rundown of your research
            ▪ Your grant plan over the next three years
            ▪ Ballpark startup needs
            ▪ Who in the department you might see being able to collaborate with. 
        ◦ You should prepare for the phone interview by writing out answers to those questions, and printing out and having in front of you:
            ▪ Profiles of anyone you know is on the hiring committee
            ▪ The mission statement of the university
            ▪ Questions for the committee
        ◦ Safe questions for the committee give them a chance to brag and don’t embarrass them
            ▪ Ask about the department environment
            ▪ Ask what distinguishes their students
            ▪ Ask what they think you should know that you haven’t asked
            ▪ Ask about the promotion and tenure processes
    • What should I expect from an in person interview
        ◦ At least a day of rapid fire 30-minute interviews with everyone in the department
        ◦ At least one dinner with the entire committee, or chair
        ◦ A talk which may be research, a teaching demonstration, or a combination of these
        ◦ A formal meeting and interview with the hiring committee. 
        ◦ A possible meeting with the dean
        ◦ Keep in mind that you are being interviewed from the second you get off of the airplane. You need to be “on” the entire time, and don’t let your guard down to drink too much at dinner. 
    • How many graduate programs should I apply to 
        ◦ Usually 9-12 is a good number, depending on your field, background, and what you can afford. 
    • How do I choose an adviser?
        ◦ One important thing that’s often overlooked is talking to other students. Ask what they’re like to work with. Ask if they’re a creep. Ask how long other students have taken to graduate. Make sure they don’t have anger issues. Ask if you can see what some of their previous advisees have gone on to do.",1,2020-01-12 04:18:00
fi0ra6,inmylifeyouare,t2_1mymk68w,Keep being rejected by journals,"I guess it's only a rant. I am not sure where I go wrong, except if my paper is not publishable at all, but I really hope that's not the case. It has given me some serious depression these past few days. 

I'm really not sure what to ask because while I have so many questions in my head, I also feel like I don't know where to start.

Maybe this: any of you has any specific tips for publishing in reputable journals? I tried the tips of inviting an expert to read my paper and invite him or her as a co-author too, but that only goes so far. Any specific strategies that you guys do that have actually helped you publish?

fhpttc,saskvjbsv,t2_5fux5072,What can I do with this professor?,"Hey everyone, 

I made a post two weeks ago about a depressive episode that made it very hard to complete a lab report. I ended up getting a 97, that was a 67 with the 3 day late penalty. 

Right now, I'm in a similar position for lab 2. It will be 3 days late before I submit it and I will likely do well. 

I have only ever turned in 2 assignments late in during my entire 3.5 semesters of college, 1 of those being the past lab report. This upcoming one will make it 3. 

I am not exaggerating when I say that this lab report has caused me panic attacks and made me sleep like 10 hours each of the past few nights (thinking I could sleep away my problems). This misery has even prevented me from doing 1 other assignment (making my total late assignments 4), because I hate being awake with it hanging over my head. 

Again, there's some level of personal accountability involved, but this, (as displayed my aforementionedacademic history) is entirely uncharacteristic. These lab reports make me legitimately miserable, causing me to sleep ungodly amounts. 

I got a 96 on the past exam when the max was a 98 and the mean was a 79, proving I know the material. 

I have a history of depression (diagnosed), and am registered with SDS for extended time and accommodations for my poor handwriting (but not my depression). 

Is there absolutely anything I can do to help my grade while explaining the extreme distress these reports have caused me?",1,2020-03-12 23:23:31
fh8021,ShadowyPrecepts,t2_12dfuq,Leave academia? What can I get?,"I am a STEM generalist working mostly with nanomaterials from biomaterials. I finished my PhD in 2018, and soon after that I continued with a related 3 year post doc, which is now half way done. Now I'm leaning towards leaving academia, but I am not sure what jobs to apply for.

During my PhD my life situation was quite different. With no kids I could - and did - dedicate myself wholly to the work. I frequently worked from morning till night seven days a week - and I loved it. I was productive and successful with fairly free reins.

Now I have two kids. I cannot work much beyond 9-5, and my spouse has secured a great job, a fantastic start to a promising career. I am very pleased with that, but it prevents international travel for me. As for my post doc my PI could hardly care less. They are never around (I see them max ten-fifteen minutes every two months or so - no exaggeration) and I'm practically abandoned with no group surrounding me, no collaborators and no project. I'm making do by initiating my own projects, writing proposals and so on - but being alone with no group is something I find more stressful than I thought I would. It was not what I expected going in, and it also gets in the way of my productivity, which is another blow to my hopes for an academic career. Unfortunately the situation in aggregate has left me with a mild depression and anxiety.

So given my lack of mobility, lack of ability to work long hours every day, reduced ability to travel for work and productivity drop - added to stress, depression, anxiety and the very slim chances of getting tenure - especially with a family locked to this relatively small city I think it's time to call it quits. 

My issue is that I have no idea what to do. Perhaps in no small part due to my current mental state. I've been set on academia for a long time, and only since about half a year into my post doc did that start changing. I have no idea what I'm looking for, so I'm looking for sine advice from people who may have had similar experiences.",1,2020-03-12 01:04:59

fdfl5z,The_Undergrad_2020,t2_4u9fvoik,I need advice from those with ADHD (especially if comorbid with depression)," 

Major: Psychology

Side Major: (not planning to pursue at 4yr) Communications

Career Interest: I don't know

Specialized field specific skills: None

I would like to preface this by saying that I already discussed things with the disabilities department at my CC, but giving precise advice and intervention specifically for ADHD is beyond their scope of work. I do have accommodations though (smart pen, text to speech). 

 It has been under a year since I was diagnosed with ADHD at 21 yrs old.

Two issues:

1. I do not know how to study as someone diagnosed (treated) with ADHD w/ depression. I assume that any literature or general advice about studying in college may not work for someone with ADHD. I am in the dark about best practices and I do not know where else to look besides trial and error (which has not been going well at all).
2. I have consistently had issues with prioritizing, perfectionism, and procrastination for as long as I can remember, which will not bode well when I transfer to a university with the intention of undertaking a bachelors program and an interest in going into graduate school. I do not know how, or if, I can modify this pattern of behavior to an acceptable level.",1,2020-03-04 16:35:06
fdav9w,Engiller,t2_kmuaf,What to pursue in masters after majoring in IR &amp; Asian Studies,"I am a second year undergraduate student majoring in International Relations &amp; Asian Studies. Before starting my degree, I found IR field interesting and I saw myself fit in it, however after starting the degree I felt into depression and frustration over how easy the modules actually were. I did not see any meaning or usefulness for what I am studying. However I decided to continue my studies because my degree had a compulsory year in China. In China I was able to find some fulfilment and enjoyment as I became one of the creative directors and managers of several projects of the university, unfortunately due to the corona virus outbreak my year abroad has been suspended and I had to return back to UK where I am once again falling into frustration over how meaningless my studies are once more. However as I only have one and half year left to complete my bachelor I decided finish it as if I were to quit now, it would be even bigger financial waste than if I have finished it. However I do not know what to do after I finish my studies in the UK. That is why I seek your advice fellow Redditors on what to do next? I would love to pursue masters degree however I do not know in what in order for it to pay off as I am limited by my undergraduate choice and after doing research, I do not know what master’s major and career should I pursue that would make me financially secured and would pay off. I am scared of just landing a job at McDonalds (nothing against McDonald’s employees) and never make it in life (financially). And the last thing I want is to be a financial burden to my parents make only a minimum wage and have the whole thing for nothing after getting this far and investing so much time and money into it. I asked the same question to my parents and personal tutor for what their opinion is, but they just keep telling me to listen to myself and do what I love. While I do understand that loving what you do plays a certain part in choosing the profession and major, I do not believe that it is necessary key when it comes to achieving financial stability and being successful. For me, I am purely money and achievements driven, as long as I will be earning high salary and know that it all leads towards a bigger end goal (such as fame, power etc.) I am willing to do whatever it takes. I know that in that case I should have picked Computer Science/Engineering/Medicine/Finance major (and I agree, but I was stupid) however at this point it is already too late for me (as I lack certificates necessary to be accepted for these majors). That is why I’m trying to find the second best solution or advice while it’s not completely too late. 

I will appreciate any advice.

f7vbtr,Street-Hat,t2_5r47cvsm,"[X-post r/gradschool] I'm being slandered, help","\*Throwaway because this is kinda sensitive and I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet

I was googling my name just because, and on the second page of the results there's a webpage from another PhD student claiming I'm an awful person, that I've engaged in academic dishonesty, that I've tampered with the results in my papers, and that the ""research"" section on my website has words that are stolen from other people. These claims are 100% false and there isn't any evidence given, this person is just claiming it.

On one hand, I want to absolutely destroy this person's academic career, have everyone know they're a liar, and see them publicly shamed for being a steaming shit of a human being. But exposing the lies means publicising them.

Also, I'm not in the US (in the UK) and I'm not interested in suing anyone. I just don't know how to resolve this since there isn't a clear place to raise non-university complaints where I am. I can think of 3 senior people at my university who I trust enough to talk to (and actually know): my PI, the institute director, and the head of graduate research.

How do I bring this up? Should I make it public? Do I message the person privately and ask them wtf the page is about? Has anyone had to deal with someone spreading nasty rumours before? 

--------------------------

**The details:**

 - I don't really know this person (Hayley\*). We both applied to the same PhD program, were both accepted to work under the same PI, but only I got funding. But Hayley and I weren't even competing for the same funding and there was room for both of us in the group, so we have no ""beef"". I met her through Twitter - *she* reached out to *me* and told me she'd applied to the same program. All of our interactions have been through Twitter and they're either pleasant or neutral, but I've always gotten the feeling that she thinks she's better than me. Despite clearly both being first-year PhDs who got into competitive programs, she has repeatedly tried to give me (unsolicited) advice on conferences and publishing even though it looks like I actually have more experience in those areas. Otherwise we just like and retweet each other's stuff.

 - Hayley is more popular/well-known than I am. She has tens of thousands of followers on Twitter and is friends with people who have 100,000+, and I have ~100. Edit: she has also been interviewed, advised for popular sci-fi movies, gone on TV and radio, etc. If this becomes ""a thing"" then I think people will want to side with her or try to excuse her behaviour before they believe me. I've seen people be accused of things a bunch of times, they get absolutely piled on and abused, and then there's no real compensation when they're proven innocent and people just continue to believe the lies. I don't want to be that person; I have a history of depression and severe anxiety and I don't think I could handle it. 

 - **I think my PI likes her better.** He's talked about how great a student she is and how disappointed he was when she didn't get funding, and he doesn't give me the same praise (that I know of), which makes me feel like I was always playing second fiddle to her. He even wants us to go to the US at some point to visit her group and collaborate. I don't care if anyone else in the department/university investigates her claims just to prove they're false, but if I ask my PI for help and he starts investigating her claims as though they have *any* potential weight to them, does that mean he doesn't fully trust me? I don't think I could continue working with him if he took her word on this for even a second.

 - The page is hosted by Hayley's website (e.g. hayleysmith.com/street-hat-is-a-liar) but if I just go to her website homepage, I can't navigate to the page through any links or menus. It seems to only be accessible by direct link, but you can find that direct link if you google my name (I have a very uncommon name, probably unique). So maybe she didn't mean to publish it or doesn't think it's visible? 

 - Hayley is generally pretty polished from what I've seen online, and the page is not - it's just text, and my name is all lowercase. Maybe it's a mental illness thing? Not an excuse for what she's done, but could mean she gets sympathy and a free pass. 

 - I'm a first-year PhD who no one really knows in academia, so this could really hurt me professionally. Even if I show everyone how much of a petty, lying piece of shit she is, I'm going to look like a trouble-maker.

f7khy5,bely_medved13,t2_5q9wn7bo,Managing research responsibilities with depression,"TLDR - I slid into a period of moderate depression in the early stages of dissertation writing (in the humanities).  I'm falling further and further behind and struggling to focus and get organized through the negative thoughts and fatigue.  How do you manage intensive research (particularly in the humanities) with depression?  

Hi reddit! I'm an advanced PhD student in literature/modern languages in the early stages of dissertation writing.  Grad school has been somewhat of a roller coaster for me, but until now, I've managed to be pretty productive, meet all of my program's mileposts for earning the degree, and for the most part have found the process to be rewarding.  However, I struggle from ADHD, which can create focus issues that occasionally lead to low-grade depression. Although I've somehow managed these symptoms and turned in quality work in the past, I have faltered while transitioning into the dissertation stage.  

Last semester I had a pretty intensive teaching load, and had to be on campus and in the classroom 5 days a week.  It was also a class full of difficult, under-motivated students, including one who was sexually harassing me. At the same time I was trying to complete my prospectus so I can start on the actual fun research for my dissertation.  Due to my issues with organization and focus, I always struggle during the beginning stages of larger research projects, but the stress from teaching caused my research productivity to grind to a halt.  Although I was spending large amounts of time in the library and reading, I struggled to actually find and retain the information I needed to finish the prospectus.  I ended up having to delay my prospectus defense, which is the first time I've failed to meet a major program milestone in time.

I was hoping that the new semester would offer me a fresh start and new focus, but unfortunately that hasn't been the case.  Instead, I've slid into a state of mental chaos and fatigue, which are fueled by low grade depression.  Reading takes me 2-3 times as long as usual due to issues with focus, I'm exhausted all the time, and I'm struggling to complete even basic research tasks.  Naturally, my inability to complete things makes my depression and negative thinking patterns worse.  I'm not sure how to manage the research process while I'm in this state.  Everything about it is so painfully slow that it feels I will never finish, and it is embarrassing to face my advisor when I haven't produced anything.  

I'm on antidepressants and see a therapist fairly regularly.  I'm also trying to implement better organizational systems, although this is an ongoing process.   I find that I'm able to get the teaching duties done because I have to face my students every day, but the intangible and open-ended nature of humanities research is so much harder to manage.   I've considered the possibility that this isn't the right career path for me, but I'm passionate about my dissertation topic and want to at least try to write one chapter before I decide on a career shift.  But I need to finish the prospectus before that can happen, and that task feels impossible right now.  In the meantime, for those of you who struggle with depression, anxiety, or adhd -- how do you make this career work?",1,2020-02-22 00:21:21
f6xkq2,Al-Uni-Frankfurt,t2_5qjhoucd,We Need participants! (Mindfulness as Intervention),"Hello everyone,

Me (a bachelor student) and my team in the social psychology department at the university of Frankfurt in Germany in collaboration with the social psychology department at the university of Zurich are really in a huge need of  **academics** **as** **participants** for our study on **mindfulness** in the workplace, with which we want to help academics to better master the challenges of this particular professional field.

According to a study in Nature Biotechnology **anxiety disorders** and **depression** are **6 times** **more common** among scientists than among the general population. Temporary positions, the competitive job market, pressure from the supervisor or the fear of failure are just some of the many risk factors for academics and especially for **doctoral students**.

So basically, if you participate you may actually stumble upon usefully doable exercises to deal with the down side of being an academic. (also please participate for the sake of helping me recruit for my bachelor thesis)

8e3iy0,NoxiousQuadrumvirate,,"Is it appropriate to ask someone about their experiences with disability, if they haven't already told you?","I'm in graduate school, and I have a pretty serious condition that causes me to miss out on a bit of class time. One of my supervisors has dealt with a disability that caused him to take longer in school and which requires medication, but I never asked specifics because I didn't want to pry, so I don't know exactly what disability. They were offhand comments made in conversation a few times, but that kind of conversation doesn't come up often. My best guess would be related to depression/stress, but it's just a guess. 

Given that he knows (or will know soon) exactly what my condition is, would it be appropriate for me to ask him for advice? Specifically for getting medical extensions because I know he had one and it's an idea I can't decide on (he suggested it to me), but also for other general resources and tips. It'd also be nice just to be open with someone else with a disability. A significant fraction of my cohort have documentation for disability, but they don't know about my condition and I really can't tell them. I want to be open with people, but I know it isn't smart to do that. On top of getting through graduate school, I have to make it look like I don't have a disability or at least field questions about what that disability is. 

I already have a medical team I can talk to, but they don't know what it's like to be in my exact program under my exact supervisors, whereas this guy does. 

And the supervisor-supervisee relationship is pretty personal here. I've met the families of the faculty, we've travelled together, we go drinking together, we eat lunch together. So they're my bosses, but they're also colleagues and I think also friends. I'm not going to offload my emotional baggage onto anyone or share intimate details about my life, but I'd like a frank conversation about academia and chronic illness. I don't *think* I'd be overstepping boundaries here, but I'm not 100% sure. He's admitted to having a chronic illness directly to me, just not explicitly what it is, and I don't want to push an issue he doesn't want to talk about. ",4,2018-04-22 14:22:58
8a27fa,SesameDog,,In need of serious guidance on making a huge decision. Switching: M.S. or Ph.D.,"I am currently a first year (2nd semester) in a Chemistry Ph.D. program. I have been struggling with severe depression and anxiety since Fall 2015, and have been medicated for it since. In the past year, my symptoms have become significantly more intense. I wonder what is the point of life, why am I doing anything, what am I even passionate about. I was struggling in being productive in the lab, though that may just be in my head (i.e. imposter's syndrome; my advisor thought I was doing ok). I have been doing perfectly fine in all of my classes. A month ago I expressed my feelings towards my advisor and told him I wanted to switch to a masters program. He seemed supportive. It was like a little bit of a weight had been lifted off my shoulders once I told him and had begun the process of switching. I have not submitted any official papers yet, so I am still a Ph.D. student. I even became interested in getting a second masters (once I finished the coursework chemistry masters) revolved around getting a teaching certification in chemistry; I've already keenly expressed my interest in that program with the head of that sub-department. Although I was a bit happier with my decision, as time passed, I realized I was just as depressed. I have been seeing a counselor for about 5 weeks, but she is honestly a bit useless and unproductive; I cancelled any future appointments with her.

The main issue here is that I was just awarded the NSF GRFP fellowship, and I am now having second thoughts on my decision of switching. Of course, the fellowship should not be a major deciding factor in my predicament, but I am starting to wonder if my decision was based on ""taking the easy way out"". I feel awful that the fellowship could have went to someone who could have used it for their Ph.D. I am most scared of regretting my decision, no matter which route I choose. There is an option of switching the focus of the Ph.D. to chemical education, but only one student has done this before. Overall, I am unsure if I really enjoy being in the lab and if I am truly more interested in a chemical education career. I admit, I am young, but I have also experienced a lot of life-altering events that have changed my viewpoint on life. You have no clue how long you are going to live; anything could happen. Why not make the best of it and choose the routes that will make you happier? Obviously, philosophy is not my forte, but I think you get the point. I have family and a fiancé who are supportive of my decision, no matter what. I need non-biased tips and guidance, whether its guidance about figuring out what I want in life, how to handle depression through a Ph.D., or how to best decide which route to take.

8lylld,bigolmonkeyfarm,,Was my research director justified in penalizing my lab grade?,"Preface: this is a longer post because I wanted to include detail for context. Thank you in advance for your consideration to offer insight.

I found out that my lab grade was getting penalized by my director a couple days after my college graduation by my new supervisor ""T"". 

For the last 4 semesters of college, I had worked as an undergraduate research assistant. The penalization shocked me, because I had earned A marks every single semester prior to this last one. To get an A in lab was relatively easy- all you had to do was put in effort and not miss lab meetings or studys. These were all things I thought I had done.

During the first 3 semesters, I worked under my supervisor ""R"". She was wonderful and was always offering constructive feedback. This last semester, I was put to work under my new supervisor ""T"", a grad student.

T was offered a lot of flexibility schedule wise. This was great for me, because my last senior semester was the one of busiest yet (e.g. pre-med coursework, job hunting/job interviews, tons of advisor meetings).

The following will explain why my grade got penalized...

The project I was working on under T required that I drive to 3 different child subjects houses and do a reading intervention with them for 30 minutes once every week.

My weekly interventions were this:
Tuesdays:
4:30PM- Subject #1
6:00PM- Subject #2

Thursdays: 
4:30PM- Subject #3

T set the times I'd be meeting with my families based off of my class schedule. He did not ask me if these times were okay with me before he told the families that these were their official intervention times. After I saw the schedule, I expressed to him that these times would negatively interfere with my Tuesday and Thursday midterm exams (6 in total for the semester, all at 7:15PM), especially the 6:00PM intervention. He said that rescheduling the official meeting times with the families was unfavorable, so, he offered some solutions for my midterm days.

Since the 6:00PM intervention was an actual time conflict that would have prevented me from making it to my test on time, he told me that on the day of my 3 Tuesday midterms, I could get this ""shift"" covered another RA, without penalty. 

Initially, he was opposed to me rescheduling or having my 4:30PM shifts covered on my midterm days. I'm very anal about test preparation, and I prefer to not have interrupted study time if I can help it at least 3 hours prior to an exam (keep in mind these tests were for bioch and advanced principles of chem and biochem). I went to my 4:30 intervention on my first Tuesday midterm day to see if it would pose a major conflict.

The hour that I lost doing the experiment an hour and half before my exam was not preferable. While doable, it made me extremely anxious. I went to my supervisor ""T"" again and asked if I could have someone cover my 4:30 shifts on my midterm days (or if I could reschedule with my families).

I was given a verbal ""thats fine as long as you keep me posted with when you will meet with families/who is covering your shifts"". So for the rest of the semester, I had another RA cover my midterm day interventions for me, or if they couldn't do it, I would ask the families if there was another time that week that they could meet. Sometimes I would still cover the 4:30 interventions the day of a midterm. Because I was changing the order of things on these days, I always made sure to keep my families informed at least a week or two in advance.

This was defined as an issue at the VERY end of the semester when the lab director discovered that I was having my interventions covered/rescheduled on midterm days. She decided to grade all of the final 8 week evaluations for the RAs on ""T's"" project. She deducted points for all of the interventions that I ""missed"".

In the syllabus, it says that you cannot miss an experiment. For my first 8 week evaluation, my supervisor ""T"" has in writing that I didn't miss any experiments. This was written after I had my midterm day interventions covered, so there was no indication that I should have viewed these as missing an experiment. Additionally, I think morally, this should be an exception to the rule since my supervisor created an actual time conflict with my tests and did not offer a proper solution vie the lab policy. I also do not think that I ""missed"" the interventions that were rescheduled because they were rescheduled- I didn't *not* show up for the experiment, because it was moved to another day.

I would have never done any of this if I was aware that this was against policy. I expressed all of this to the director of the lab and she is not budging. She told me that I can repeal my grade, but that she's also on the academic fairness committee (you can put two and two together).

This is why is matters to me:
Grade-wise, this was my last semester to land my very first 4.0. I got an A in all of my classes except this one, which I expected to get an A in. I was so excited because I thought I had done it. The 4.0 was a personal academic goal I had made for myself after beating my depression sophomore year.

Principal wise, I do not think that her response was justified. We emailed back and forth quite a bit. At points, my responses were emotional, but they were never disrespectful or mean towards her. In her responses, she got aggressive and insulted me multiple times. She also stated that I am the one completely at fault, and that my new supervisor did nothing wrong. Up to this point, she had thought very fondly of me and was impressed by my prior work. She even offered to write me a letter of recommendation for medical school before this. 

So to the main question, was her point penalty justified? If it was, I would like to know so that I can learn from my mistake. 

If it wasn't, what course of action should I take? I'm really upset about this because I put a lot of time and effort into lab, and really loved working there... but should I just let it be and move on?

8k8o6r,ImportantConflict6,,Please help a confused aspirer!,"Hello,

so, I had to think quite a bit on whether to post this from a
throwaway account or my normal one, and at this moment I don't know
which one I will have done, if I ever post this.  Whatever.  This is
irrelevant, but I needed to include this paragraph to, I guess,
demonstrate my confusion, which is the general theme of this post.

I am a ‘curious’ person.  I like reading, learning, discovering,
philosophising, writing, exploring.  I love literature, and I love
programming.  And I ‘aspire’ to become an academician.  A researcher?
I look up to those who create information in their rooms in
universities.  To those who learn their fields to great depths.  And I
have the... push inside me to become one them, to read, to explore, to
find out, to write, to go to conferences, to give lessons, and to do
what I love for a living: learning and learning, and telling others
what I have learnt.

But, I can not consistently have this positive attitude.  The same
people I look up to, I sometimes look down upon them.  When I move on
from a fantasy of Dead-Poets-Society-esque lecturing and religiously
diligent research (which I'm too distracted to do) that leads to great
discoveries and fame, I can not stop myself from thinking that this
whole thing is (and I am afraid the following words will be offensive
for some, but I have to include them in the name of honesty) nothing
but a huge circlejerk, of arrogant and lazy people like myself, a
useless churn with a distorted image hallowing it, making a living out
of a fake-busy idleness.  Given especially the field I want to
participate, which is literature or humanities in general.

It's not that I'm without any research interests.  I'm interested in
how... and yeah.  There is my problem: I'm interested in many things,
but I can not for the life of me put one forward as a serious research
interest.  And I submerge and suffocate under the unadmittable
question: am I only a ‘curious’ guy, am I nothing more than a
wiki-walker, are my ‘questions’ and ‘research interests’ basically
completely uninteresting and dull wonders everybody trying to act like
a sophisticated person seem to have or try to seem to have?

I am about to graduate from a university course on Italian
philology. Four and a half years ago, just about to leave my teens
behind, I wanted to become a computer programmer.  Then something
happened and I found myself in love with literature, and burdened with
philosophical questions.  That questions, and pursuing them, saved me
from depression and ignorance.  Not that I was uninterested in
literature before, I always read, in some episodes of my adolescence I
wrote.  But those moments just before starting the uni I learnt
philosophy, and I learnt thinking freely.  And I wanted to read and
write, I wanted to be a writer.  Then the affascination with academy
that I was talking about came around, and then I started thinking that
if I was an academician, I could liberate myself from the
soul-consuming and personal-time-exploiting world of work and
concentrate on my incessant curiosities and the urge in me to be
free of anything ‘boring’ that I just can not suppress.  But as the
actual thing is more and more imminent, I can not hide from myself
that it is completely possible that what I dream of might in reality
be what I in actuality always dreaded and always tried to avoid:  a
boring pointless way to sell my time with merely money in return.

Now, I am a good writer (in the sense that I can compose
more-than-decent prose; English is not my mother tongue so don't judge
me with that), a good orator and---I really believe that I am---a good
teacher.  I know that when I want to write an extensive essay on
something, or when I am in front of a class giving a lecture, I will
be successful.  I know that I will be useful to my (hypothetical)
students, and that I would make a popular teacher.  But that is not
what all academia is, academia is also putting lots of time into
research, trying to invent new knowledge and change the world for the
better.  But I have the life-sucking disease that if I end up thinking
that it is pointless, I can't, for the life of me, do it.  As good as
I think I am in explaining what I think, so much useless am I in
explaining my feelings face-to-face without distracting myself and
getting bored, so I believe the best recourse for me is here.  Or if
it is not, please excuse me and concede me the relief of having gotten
at least a part of this stuff out of my chest, which I need so badly.
So, has anybody here been through these troubles?  Can you advise me
(or tell me off because at this point I feel like really really
deserving it) on how to overcome these issues, or at least find a
better path to my life (which I know is too much to ask, but sometimes
even a little anecdote does much to change one's perception of
things)?

Thanks a lot in advance!",2,2018-05-17 23:17:08
8jodpa,TELEGRAF_ME_UR_NUDES,,Contract Faculty looking for accommodations for no Night Classes – Am I being unreasonable?,"Hi everyone,

I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask this question, but I'm quite stressed about this and I'm not sure what I should do. I'm a contract faculty member in a small department at a large \(= resourced; probably adverse to litigation\) R1 institute. I haven't renewed my contract for next year, but both I and my chair expect me to be here next year.

The issue is that I'm hard of hearing and suffer from clinical depression. This year, I taught a night class \(6:00–8:30\). This caused me a lot of difficulties. For one, I didn't have reliable way to get home at that time, so I often slept in my office. Secondly, it really exacerbated my usually\-under\-control depression. I often came home \(when I did come home\) crying, feeling suicidal, or feeling dizzy. I had to cancel all my meetings for Thursdays to recover, and I often was asleep until 3 or 4 PM the next day. Moreover, although I don't use an ASL interpreter, I was considering requesting one for the following year, and I'm not sure that there are options available for interpreters in the evening.

So, I've had several conversations with my chair about this, and she's been unwilling to change my teaching schedule. I've offered a few solutions to this \(swapping classes around\), but she's shot each one down. Who should I communicate with about this? I don't have a contract signed for next year, and I haven't been offered one yet, so I don't have much room for negotiation. Would it be self\-sabotaging to speak to the EEOC? Should I first try to get a note from my psychiatrist explaining my situation and give that to my chair first? Should I have a letter from disability services? I'm quite baffled at how unwilling she's been at changing the schedule, and I'd rather not reveal more health information than I need to, but do I have any recourse here? I'm afraid if I pursue anything, I just won't get a contract offer next year.",11,2018-05-15 19:26:18
8gj6xq,ThatDamnWalrus,,Need help on how to explain to a professor my situation.,"So, I am in my 2nd semester as a transfer student at a college, and am on probation. This was largely due to my sisters suicide attempts during the first semester which took a massive toll on me because of how hard it was to be so far away from my home while all of this was going on. Heading into this semester my sluggishness/depression carried over, and got increasingly worse as I lost any academic confidence I had. I turned the quarter at the midway point of this semester as I was re-prescribed Adderall for my ADHD, and I partially kicked out of the depressive sluggish state I was in, and have finally gotten into a real good groove academically for what feels like the first time in my life. Thats great and everything, but I am worried I might have been able to kick into gear just a little too late, as my professor for my democracy and development in taiwan class told emailed me back this morning that I have an F in the class, but that the final should boost me to a D-/D/D+, and this is finals week. This course hasn't had much work to complete, and the main reason for the grade was due to a poor midterm exam grade (11/30, 30% of total grade, which was shocking because I thought I at least did decently on it with the amount of studying I put into it), and attendance issues from the first month and a half of the semester. A D puts me in a position where there is a very good chance I won't be able to bring my cumulative GPA to what was required to not be suspended due to my horrendous first semester grades. Now I know, I dug my own grave here, and my standing in the class is of no ones fault but my own, but I am trying to set up a meeting or a phone call with him to just ask if their is literally anything I can do to at least get a C-, because otherwise my days here might be numbered, which would be beyond terrible, especially because I know I can come back next year and get A's and B's with a fresh start. Does anyone have any suggestions or tips on how might be the best way to explain my situation and to ask about any possible work I can do before Finals end on Friday to show I know enough of the content to deserve a C, despite my work from the first half of the semester not showing it. Any help would be extremely appreciated as I have my back against the wall right now and don't know what to do. ",1,2018-05-02 17:25:46

Now I come from a third world country where constitutionally women and men are equal and over time there has been progress but society still needs to improve a lot. Although its different from family to family but in my family the rule was that women are encouraged to study and focus on getting a job but not a career , like just enough to earn enough to support yourself and never have to rely on men for support. But Independence, being career oriented is a strict no no. No girl before me moved out of home in my entire extended family before me. And when I finished school I was denied multiple opportunities, better college, better education and made to study in a univ 4 kms from home and the idea of my parents was I will study get a job locally and get married While I had been career oriented and wanted to do a PhD and pursue a career rather than just earn enough. This put me at loggerheads with my parents and I have been under depression, stress because of constant fights and arguments with my parents to allow me to study further. Eventually seeing my persistence and dedication they came around and have since allowed me to continue. However This caused me severe anxiety and affected my undergrad performance. And I even had a breakdown which caused me to take a year off from studies between undergrad and msters .I recovered eventually and have improved my performance ever since.

8wd29f,ilpescepalla,,Delayed post-PhD blues,"Hello,

I finished a PhD in the humanities three years ago. I loved it. I had no depression whatsoever, and I loved the academic environment. I loved writing. I loved research. I loved my topic. I don't regret it.

However, I graduated in December, and December is a really hard time to apply for jobs in academia. Moreover, I had no publications, and wanted to take a breather, so I worked as a teacher in a private school as an academic English tutor. Money was good, the job wasn't bad, so I stayed a couple of years. Meanwhile, my thesis was accepted for publication with a good publisher, and has become a monograph this year.

This Spring, I quit my job for a myriad of reasons including boredom. I would love to go back to academia. I feel I still have things to say in my field. I like teaching, and I have experience, so I've been applying for academic jobs. I just have a nagging suspicion that I'm not good enough with a single monograph under my belt.

What are the chances today to find an academic teaching/research job in the humanities for me?  Should I try harder or just give up?

8vzm2v,silverlakebob,,Please Answer These Simple Questions,"“Get a Ph.D and become a waiter!”  How many times did you hear *that* quip throughout the 1980s?  (Now, of course, you’re lucky if you *can get* a waiter’s job, but that’s another story.)  Then quite suddenly everyone was saying the exact opposite.  At the tail end of the decade, every single person I met who had a Ph.D urged me to go to grad school, insisting that there’s going to be a huge glut of jobs in academia.  Sure enough, in 1989, at the orientation of my doctoral program at my distinguished university, the chair of the history department got up and made the following declaration:  “Normally I have the awkward task at these orientations of lauding all that our department readily provides to its students, but then offering a sober assessment of the dismal job prospects that will follow.  But *this* year, for the first time since I’ve become chair, I can safely say that, *barring a major depression*, there will a job waiting for you when you graduate.  Here at our university, nearly half of our faculty in the history department, who had been hired to teach the baby boomers, will be retiring over the next decade, and we plan to replace every retiree with two new faculty members.”  

Well, I don’t remember any major depression in the 1990s, but I certainly noticed that none of those jobs materialized.  In fact, what materialized was a three-year hiring freeze in the mid-nineties and a rapid and unprecedented increase in contingent labor.  The new business model of American academia became rampant exploitation of part-time employees.  

Here are a few questions I’d like tenured faculty to answer:  Just how complicit *are they* in this new business model of those faculty-run institutions of theirs?  How much do *they* benefit economically from the denial of a living wage and benefits to their academic colleagues?  How much do *they* assuage their consciences by pretending that they still function in a merit system in which the best and the brightest get their just rewards?  Do they seriously still believe that when [some 70% of all college profs are non-tenured and 50% are part-time](https://www.aaup.org/issues/contingency/background-facts)?  How do academics who pride themselves on their progressive politics live with their total lack of solidarity with contingent faculty?  Does anyone really think that all of this wouldn’t end tomorrow if the tenured faculty went on strike on behalf of their exploited colleagues?  Did not the UPS workers (those uneducated primitives) do exactly that some twenty years ago?  Why is solidarity possible among UPS workers but not among progressive-leaning academics?

8vj2at,I_exist_01,,My father mailed my now ex advisor,"Just to get it off my chest I was in a PhD program, worked with a faculty for sometime and didn't get along with him. So I have quit my program. My father knows I have been under a lot of stress and upset because of that.  I don't talk much with him as he is also a part of my anxiety issues. He is too interfering and likes to have his way all the time. He has forced decisions on me when I was a kid just become he thought it was right and would never ever listen to my opinion or what I want because he is the man of the house who makes decisions and everyone else is just supposed to obey and never question. His irresponsible decisions regarding my studies and then forcefully imposing them on me has affected my career a lot. So He found the mail address of my chairman online and mailed him and the man I worked with for sometime without telling me or consulting me. 

I am soooo angry and embarrassed. He has terrible social skills and wherever he goes he picks a fight. Idk why he doesn't understand how terribly vengeful and egoistic faculties can be. And btw who does that. I am not a school student anymore. It's my professional life and it can hurt me badly in future even if he was polite in his mail. It will come across as if I am a kid who can't handle adult responsibilities :/

I have been under a lot of pressure already, I fell sick and have been going in and out of depression and he is making my life worse like he always has. I just hope the faculties will be understanding as I apologized and said I wasn't aware of this.

8uenoi,RL_TR,,Advice. Don't want to be in Academia,"Title is pretty straight forward, but I would like some Advice (more specific to my field) about others experiences and some general advice would be so helpful.

Some background about me: I have finished two degrees with one in biology and the other in computer science. While I like biology theory I hated the lab, so I decided to do another degree in computer science in which I found my calling. Particularly around business analysis and database systems and other data science subjects.

Once I finished my degree I was coerced into doing a PhD in bioinformatics by my honors supervisor. I never was going to apply as I wanted a job, but last minuted decided to just submit an application for a PhD. Turns out I got accepted into the PhD program (along with 2 other Job offers) and decided to go down the PhD route simply cause of maybe one day returning to the university and becoming a Lecturer (I love teaching, another passion of mine).

The PhD was a very difficult experience for me as I never had true passion for it, but once it was over I was relived. Because I actually did a decent job with my thesis and got 4 publications out, my supervisor offered me a bioinformatics postdoc position which I agreed to give a try, purely because I thought I would get some good teaching experience.

I am now 1.5 years into the postdoc and hating it. It really isn't what I want to do in my life, i have no (and never had) any intention of tenure track and running my own lab. I have little passion for the work I do, all I have are a good set of skills, that I can apply, but I cant translate that to writing papers cause it is another thing I hate. Publishing. The past 1.5 years has been further made difficult due to many personal issues and all of this has made me incredibly depressed. A depression that I have never felt before in my life (That I have also neglected to take care off).

I want out, and I want to get out to either teaching, or going into a full IT job. However, i am feeling that my skills are not ""up-to-date"" enough for me to be worth hiring. Moving to industry is difficult purely because the 4 year PhD and the 1.5 years in a post doc mean my IT skills are lacking.

What advice can people give me? Has anyone made a shift from a a bioinformatics PhD/postdoc into industry (such as a data science job?)",27,2018-06-28 00:07:01
8r397m,ekkso,,Suspended Twice from Technical School. What should I do?,"Here's some backstory. Im an IT Computer Support Specialist major. I have fairly severe Attention Deficit Disorder and Depression that comes in waves. I've signed up for accommodation support through my school to assist me in this and to have it on file. 

Now to the real story.

In my first year of college my medication was too expensive to afford, as I HAD to buy the name brand stuff and my insurance deductible wasn't paid. That's $300 out of pocket. This put me in a tight spot. I wasn't taking school as seriously as I should have, and I was working a lot and going to school full time. The high school I went to did not give the ACT resources I needed to take that, so I had to take the accuplacer test through my college to better gauge me for my prerequisites and generals. I scored highly but failed in math and had to take Pre Algebra. On my first year I got a couple incompletes and failed 2 classes as well, which this caused my GPA to plummit. The weight of being full time college and 35+ hours a week in work was too much for me to handle and because of this year of failed classes I ended up getting suspended for a semester. I appealed and came back only to do poorly again in one class. My GPA cumulative rating ended up being .889 before my suspension. This academic probation also limited me to only being able to take 6 credits. This meant I had to boost my GPA cumulatively all the way to 2.0 while boosting my semester and cumulative completion rate to at least 60% (which I did) all within 2 classes. This is not possible. This issue, despite me doing so well on my recovery semester, caused me to be suspended again, along with removing my ability to get financial aid. At this point I'm wondering if I should change schools or if I should go through with the appeal process and hope they lift all the restrictions on my classes so I can get to the threshold. My cumulative GPA ending on the semester after my 2nd suspension was 1.875. just barely under what I needed. Semester GPA was 3.2",0,2018-06-14 16:32:30
8qf2uu,DepressedAcademia,,need help with career options when I can't interview well,"I've suffered from severe depression over half my life and I've been receiving treatment (medication and therapy) for a little over 10 years. I've struggled with different medication combinations and the best I can hope for is to essentially feel flat. If I try to wean off meds or decrease the dose, I end up in the hospital. I haven't told many people about this, even family, because I feel it's too personal. In the past I had to take a 2 month leave for health reasons during grad school and very few people know the real reasons for this. I also had to take an emergency two week leave during my postdoc once, again no one knows the real reasons outside of my medical team and one close friend.

Despite this I've been very productive through grad school and my postdocs. I have some high quality publications, record of funding, and there is a sense from multiple people in my department and at conferences that I'm a quality applicant. But as I'm applying for both academia and industry positions, I feel like I'm at a significant disadvantage because I'm incapable of expressing any real emotion. I can smile and say I love to do certain things (which is true), but my eyes are like I'm dead inside and my voice is false, no matter how much I try to ""act"" and force it. The number one feedback I'm coming up with in the practice talks is this lack of emotion, or that I come across as fake and need to be more genuine, except ""genuine me"" has the emotional expression of a robot. I tried to scale back my meds under doctor supervision to reduce the flat emotion side effects and that almost put me in the hospital. Therapy isn't doing anything to improve. I'm starting to feel like I'm unemployable and for good reason, because no one wants to hire a person who seems constantly dead inside or like a fake.

I don't know what other options I have for a career if I can't interview well for any position, faculty or industry. I'm thinking of just staying with industry because it's less competitive and if I have so much problems interviewing because of the medication side effects it seems impossible to get an academic position, but I don't know that I'd realistically be able to get *any* position anywhere at this point.

8q6fw0,RL_TR,,What to do about my terrible postdoc experience?,"Hey all

I currently am about 1.5 years into my Postdoc and really hating it. After finishing my PhD (with great results, 4 papers) I naturally decided  the next best step is a postdoc. Sadly I was wrong. While the beginning of my post doc i did some great analysis and produced some great results. I still have not produced any publications (only 1 papers submitted with major revision) and me and my supervisor barely communicate. We rarely meet up to discuss anything about me or my progress as he is never around, and when he is he is too busy talking to others, or making time for other postdocs.

It has gotten worse when my supervisor hired new postdocs and is throwing all opportunities at them (He includes them in grants, higher pay than me, has promoted them, given them students to supervise etc. all within 8 months of them starting). I have been here 1.5 years and I never got this treatment when I started, I am still baffled as to why their starting salaries are much higher then my own starting salary (even though we have similar number of publications before we started the postdoc).

Following all this, I am currently suffering serious depression and stress and constantly lack motivation as i have many issues in my personal life. I feel empty inside, worthless and just not good enough. I have isolated myself from all my colleagues (causing them to not talk to me or invite me to anything, coffee, drinks, lunch, dinners etc).

Im just so done. I have no idea what I should be doing in my life anymore. The bright young student that I used to be, who was so excited about my future, is all but gone.

I want to move into the industry and return to my original plan before the PhD of working in an IT company, but I feel that doing a PhD puts me in a disadvantage, and my current horrid experience in my postdoc has all but thrown any career opportunities for me out the door. But I really want to move into the Industry. Does any one have any advice about how I can transition? ",1,2018-06-11 03:40:32

He sent her an email about a possible job opening at a really good biotech company. To me that sounded like a gentle nudge out of the door. This morning her PI met with her trying to figure out what's wrong and even opened up a bit about himself and how he struggled with grad school. As amazing of a friend she is, she's as stubborn as an old mule. She went to counseling before and was even prescribed medication but never went through with it.

8ot9ez,__Hypnotic__,,Withdraw from 2 courses or risk 2 C's?,"So, I'm in a tricky situation. My parents pay for my college. Last fall, I attended a major university but failed ALL my classes due to some shitty situations and depression. I then transferred to a COMMUNITY college in the same area the following spring semester, in hopes to pursue my AA and transferring instead of starting out with a 0.0 GPA at a major university. I got 3 B's and 1 A that semester.

It is now summer and I am taking 3 courses. Two of them, I am very behind in and have calculated that there is only a possibility for me to make a high C or low B (assuming I make straight 100's on everything now, which isn't likely), and my father has told me ""From now on out you need to get straight A's""

I have no doubt I'm capable of succeeding in these courses, I'm just so far behind in the workload it's ridiculous. Shoulda just kept up with it instead of telling myself I'll do it later, it's summer.

So here is the question. The deadline to WITHDRAW from these 2 courses is in two days. They are easy courses too. I just took them for credits, but are 6 week courses and the workload is immense. Should I withdraw these 2 classes, and save my GPA, or continue on? I was thinking to hide it from my parents if I drop them. I feel shitty for where I've put myself, especially dropping 2 EASY courses, the workload and summer in a college town got to me. Just looking forward and at my grade, because the reason I'm in this situation in the first place is that I didn't drop any courses my fall semester which I regret.",3,2018-06-05 18:31:23

9fgtsf,Molina_Eco,t2_17gt9zb,How to become useful ?,"Hi people, 
I’m a French grad student in Health economics in my final  year. I’m 28 yo. I have realized that public health research is not for me. I have few experiences and each time, my subject was disappointed. For example, the subject of my thesis is “The cost of a pathology”, so I measure the total amount that a pathology costs. My last internship was about the consumption of psychotropics in Europe, so I measured the consumption of psychotropics pills in Europe… 
Right now, I want to be useful to society. I’m a pharmacist, with two master degrees (public health and Health Economics/Health Technologies Assessment) and the next year a Ph.D in Health Economics. 
Previous work : 
Intership in epidemiology (4 mouth). This experience made me decide to do research.  It was cool, I analyzed the relationship between a drug and a pathology in a cohort. 
Intership in a state agency (6 mouth). It was a lot of data management, but the staff was great people. I measure the quality of a database about all inpatients in my country (so millions of lines).
1 year in ministry of health : about the consumption of psychotropics in Europe. It was a strange experience. I had finished all the tests after 2 months, then my supervisor left. I stayed 1 month without any hierarchy, and then the new supervisor asked me to continue analyses that didn't make much sense for 6-7 months. The kind of analysis I did ? PCA (principal component analysis) with &lt; 10 events… I felt in depression, because I believed I was too stupid to understand why this was a good idea when my supervisor was so confident.  
And actually my thesis (3 years) with a database with billions of lines and hundreds of row. Again, I have often fallen into depression. I see all my colleagues doing crazy stuff (modeling, machine learning, statistical testing) while all I am asked are averages and medians with no possibility to deviate. 
At the end of my day, I don't think I have any concrete skills to bring to anyone. All my previous work was descriptive. My results are relevant only for few officials who can put it in the introduction in a report.  That's why I would like to be useful. Do a job where I know that contributes to making this world a better place (after all, I am first and foremost a medical professional). I am currently interested in the Universal Health Coverage.. But I don't know if I have the talent to work in the World Bank or the WHO. I’m little bit lost. How to become useful ? Any advice ?

Unknowingly contracted depression and an anxiety disorder and had to withdrawal from many classes: I did not know I had such problems at the time. I lived at home where one family member was highly emotionally abusive, so I transfered schools when I was 21 with the help of my father, and started to see a counselor. I was then was sent to a psychiatrist. She diagnosed me with severe depression, put me on meds, I did terrible for another semester, meds were adjusted. Another semester, still pretty bad, meds where adjusted, and I went into recovery, my grades went up dramatically, and I started to feel better. Since then, because of all the withdrawls, a few failed classes, and a transfer, it looks like I am going to graduate at the age of 25.

I am in the process of picking and applying to schools for masters programs.
At the moment I do not have a strong interest in research. 
I'd like to become a therapist, I'm interested in relationship/marriage counseling and depression.
I guess in my head I picture myself in 1 on 1 or 1 on 2 (with a couple) with weekly visits or something in a more long term setting with patients. Kind of like the movie ""analyze this""

From what I understand counseling programs are being phased out of most universities and they might be more for people who want to become school counselors or something but clinical has a stronger emphasis on research and more serious mental disorders like substance abuse or learning disabilities.

Please feel free to correct me as a lot of this is new to me being the only person in my friends/family to even finish a 4 year uni.

I just want to know what programs to look for and what some good schools are (already eyeing NYU counseling program and have had an informal yet encouraging meeting with a faculty member about my chances of admission)

9pvdmm,CROWNDMSFT,t2_tsovfw,Guidance going back to school,"Dear Scholars of Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I am in dire need of your assistance. I have always been an academically-focused individual as far back as grade school. I come from an impoverished Black family. Everyone believed that I go to college. Everyone believed that I would do great things. Being ""smart"" was only saving grace.  Also, I went to public schools in the ghetto so getting good grades... wasn't that difficult. Moving onto HS, at the end of my freshmen year, I was placed in the IB program where I remained until graduation. The curriculum was intense enough that I actually had to put in effort. And I did, maintaining a B average in most of my classes.

&amp;#x200B;

Tragedy struck when I was then evicted from my home in my Junior year. My family was split up, my mother staying in a shelter and my sister with a friend. From that point onward, I spent most of my time living from basement-to-basement through the generosity of friends. As a result, the years of academic excellence that I strived to obtain came crashing down. I stayed home from school. I stopped doing homework. I scored poorly on the SAT (1110 of 1600). I didn't apply to colleges. I stopped caring about the future. At that point in my life, I underwent a severe depression where I believed there was no place in the future for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Flashforward 3 years, I'm doing slightly better. I've worked mediocre jobs and saved up a few hundred dollars... However, I do not wish to continue living my life this way. All of my peers are almost finished with their bachelors... and I have nothing to show for it. Right now, I'm sleeping on Grandma's couch, a step away from homelessness.  I feel like... everyone had so many expectations of me, both family and professors... and I let everyone down. So what I need from you all... is guidance.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I spend two years in community college and then transfer to a four-year university? 

I have no way to pay for tuition... Would it be possible to obtain a full-ride despite not being a student? I am heavily against taking out loans as I do not wish to spend my 30s and 40s paying them off...

&amp;#x200B;

Should I retake the SAT and try to score in the 1500-1600 range? Will I be able to obtain a full-ride scholarship then?

&amp;#x200B;

My passion lies in acting and music... But those are both long term investments. For the present, I need something concrete that will produce results. What do you think would be the best route for me? Please share your experiences going back to school as I would love to hear them.

9oyp0d,Therealtylerwickett,t2_13sowmx7,A dude walked into my room and offered me a job,"We talked for a while, before he told me the firm he worked at was looking for workers. We'd talked for about an hour and he assured me that if I showed up, he'd like to hire me. It seems like a non-stressful position, just calling people and asking them to create a bank account.

I don't know how seriously I should take that, since like I feel like every time I apply to a job they act like they're going to give it to me - but I'm tempted to try. The thing is, my last work experience was disasterous.

The other thing was - this was just a part time position. I was also doing full time school, but I just ended up doing horrible at both school and work. This is the year I'm retaking most of the courses I ended up dropping/failing that year. I just don't want to revert back to what I was that year and spend another year undoing the stupid mental and academic damage. I'm trying to apply for a masters in my fifth year, but if I screw up again, then that won't be an option.

I was working in a fast food cafe, it's basically one kitchen for subway, pizza pizza, and a bunch of other fast food giants. That year and the year before it, i was sort of just slowly building myself up from some stuff. I thought i could go to work, something I was sure was beyond me in highschool.

At first I loved it, I loved being on cashier. My manager told me to talk to people while I dealed with them, which i loved doing, I loved seeing them smile, and getting them to laugh - but whenever my manager came near me I'd instinctively feel guilty.

A remnant of the broken me from before, but i felt like I was stealing money from her basically. I can't describe the irrationality that goes into death, grief and depression, but all of highschool I was pretty convinced I wasn't entitled things I wanted. I still felt guilty when I ate food, when i invited people over, when my dad looked at me, there was always guilt tied into it, Someone else could have eaten it, forcing them to be around me through pity, or someone else should have been here instead.

Whenever she was near I'd start stuttering basically, and she'd get really mad. That happened two more times (once i even admitted that she made me nervous, at which she became furious telling me not to blame my problems on her) After christmas, most of which i spent dreading going back, she pulled me aside to tell me that she tried not to judge people by their work performance and that she was going to give me another chance in the kitchen.

At this point my fears were validated. I worked in the kitchen, it was more manual than anything so I could at least ignore everyone else, but whenever someone called my name I would freak the fuck out, jump a foot into the air, and drop whatever I was holding. They were all really nice, and they'd hide whatever fuckups I created, but they treated me like a child and I couldn't blame them. I just felt more and more like I was stealing.",1,2018-10-17 13:32:22
9o67p7,Fredrock26,t2_mtydi,Potential Psych grad student in need of advice,"Hi everyone,
I graduated from UMD psych program couple of years back. Due to financial and life reasons I had to work for a bit before returning to complete my masters. I am currently volunteering at a research lab and working as an ABA therapist. 
I am looking to apply to NYU- UMD and potentially some Cali schools. NYU and UMD are safe bets (I had an informal interview at NYU and they said with research experience I'd have no problems getting in) but I'd really like to relocate and since I want to move to california after graduating either way I figured it makes sense to apply to schools there to begin with.

I basically want to focus on 1 on 1 therapy and focus on depression or couples/relationship therapy. As I understand counseling would be the correct program for me as opposed to something like clinical psych.

9m9wvu,Schwarzschild_Radius,t2_en5id,Recovering from the seeming point of no return?,"Any thoughts on my situation would be greatly appreciated… 

School used to be my whole life, my greatest passion. I was an A student with honors, good relationship with professors. I tutored other students. I’m currently in my last year of undergrad on a full-ride national scholarship (among other grants). The plan was to go to grad school (which I’m in a prep program for) to become an English professor, which I thought I would love and be good at, and my mentors thought so too.

But over the past year I’ve sort of let everything go to shit. . . 

I was sexually assaulted by an English prof. and mentor. I reported him and he lost his job but it didn’t go to trial. That was two years ago, and I was hanging in there, but he started stalking me on campus and writing negative things about me online last year. (I should note: he worked at my community college, not my current university.) He stands outside my dorm and classes just watching me. My Dean and Campus Security is aware, but I haven’t tried for a restraining order for lack of evidence of the stalking. In the Spring semester, I saw him nearly every day, and I was terrified to be on campus, and dropped almost all my classes. Lately, I rarely see him, but I’m still uncomfortable on campus. 

I think the stalking set something off in me though. It’s not just the anxiety of being on campus. Since he was my English prof., all of my classes now remind me of him. I can’t stay focused on any assignment. Even minor readings have become difficult but my workload is usually multiple novels a week. But worst of all, I’m starting to realize I’m afraid of the classroom environment now. My former professor was highly manipulative and his classes were absolutely nerve-wracking – he was **exactly** like [Terrence Fletcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yL-avlEsg&amp;frags=pl%2Cwn) in [*Whiplash*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDAsABdkWSc&amp;frags=pl%2Cwn)*.* Before every class, I am filled with excruciating anxiety; no matter how nice the professors, I still expect them to scream and throw things and humiliate students in front of everyone and keep me after class to grill me or mess with me, like he did. I don’t think I’m the same anymore. I’ve always been proud of my writing ability, but even this very post – which should be so simple – is making me cringe.

So, here’s how I’ve screwed up over the past year: Last fall, I was hospitalized after a surgery toward the end of the semester, and I received an Incomplete in two classes for which I owed assignments. The professors were laid-back and so I took my time doing the assignments well while I recovered (I’m a bit of a perfectionist and I felt I owed them **perfect** assignments because they graciously gave me extensions). But then the stalking began, and I spiraled into a deep depression and let deadline after deadline pass by. I was convinced I had to quit because this field was forever ruined for me. The rare days I did have motivation, I did my work well, and I still squeaked by with mostly A’s.. But I still had to drop a couple classes. Even though I was terribly depressed and hopeless, I managed to obtain an opportunity for summer research in the hopes that I would begin to feel better and push through and be able to apply for grad school this fall. 

I didn’t get better. I never finished my last two papers for the Incomplete grades and they lapsed to F’s. I barely managed any research over the summer and that’s sitting on the back-burner with an extension. Some point around the beginning of the summer I decided that this dream of mine (to become a professor) was doomed and, because that’s all I thought I was meant to do, that I was going to kill myself. I stopped doing everything because I could barely write a sentence or get through a chapter of a book. I stopped talking to my professors. I changed my mind, as you can see. I signed up for classes last-minute. But my scholarship was consequently delayed and I didn’t money for books and I barely have food and I saw the former professor on campus again. Some profs/mentors were convinced that if I turned in the papers, though it’s not supposed to work this way, my other professors would change my grades from the lapsed F’s. But I never finished those either. So, the stress of everything on my back-burner is making me struggle in the current classes. I’m terrified to go to class most days.  With my former professor, if I missed an assignment or a class, I was guaranteed to be screamed at or humiliated in class or fucked with after class. Logically, I know my current professors won’t do that, but when I’m so stressed and depressed, the possibility is too overwhelming.

So, right now, I have 2 F’s, my absences in my current classes have put me on a track to failure, and I still have a research project from the summer to do. My scholarship runs out this year. To graduate with my Bachelor’s, I need to have those F’s changed, pass these current classes, finish the research project, and fill up and succeed in my next two terms of school. 

I think I’m a good student. I’ve written a 30-page A+ paper in one night. Last semester, I wrote my final paper in a few hours on a cellphone in a car on the way to a concert 300 miles away and received an A. If I was doing well, these things would be no sweat. And furthermore, I would love it. I thoroughly enjoyed school. I used to look forward to class. Writing papers used to be thrilling. And all I wanted to do was teach. No matter how hard a struggle, I still help my fellow students when the opportunity arises.

What do you all think? Should I drop out? Has this career path been ruined? Can I salvage this? How do I talk to my professors? I can’t exactly say, “sorry I missed so much class, I’ve been depressed and stressed out.” That’s not an excuse. I can’t exactly say, “please accept my ultra-late paper; life has been hard.” Ideally, I want to continue on the path I was once on; I want to rekindle my passion and my dream and reclaim the classroom environment, but I think, practically,  I need to at least finish my Bachelor’s. I was given this incredible opportunity with my scholarships (otherwise school wasn’t even a possibility) and I can’t just throw it away. I can worry about grad school later if that’s something I choose to do. But even the smallest things – simple assignments and just attending class, and especially communicating these things with my professors – seem so impossible these days.",1,2018-10-07 23:44:53
9lrsuz,lennylowwy,t2_14aq0ty0,Going back to community college after failing out an entire semester and moving across the country,"I graduated in 2016 and went straight into college which probably wasn’t my smartest idea. I wasn’t ready but I wanted to make my grandmother proud before she passed because no one in my family has ever made it to college. I wasn’t sure what I was going to major in or anything I was just working towards my AA degree. 


I finished off freshmen year with a 4.0 and was on the deans list, it felt amazing. I thought hey this could be easy. I was wrong. Sophomore year started off horribly. My uncle, whom I was living with, got bone cancer that spread throughout his entire body and killed him 3 months later. I missed so many classes because I was taking him to and from treatments and trying to spend as much time with him as I could. I just couldn’t catch up after. I fell into a deep depression and just gave up. I failed every class I took for those 2 semesters. 



I don’t think I can qualify for FAFSA anymore because of this. I was on their grant money when I failed and I remember getting some letter in the mail about how my GPA dropped below the level I qualify or something. I threw it away like an idiot. 



I already know any of the credits I do have mostly won’t even transfer because I moved from Minnesota to Texas and they have different criteria. I’m guessing I’ll have to start over completely which sucks but I don’t know what else to do. I can’t remember if I took the SAT or ACT, I feel like I HAD to but I cant remember the scores or anything. I don’t even know how to get my transcripts from my old high school and college. 



I could really use some guidance on what I will need and how/if I can go back to college without taking out huge loans. Thank you. ",1,2018-10-06 00:28:16
9wsatt,Beta_2,t2_zn6l0,I fell behind in my PhD and it’s making me sick. I desperately need help to get back on track.,"I started my PhD in March, and until June I was nailing it. I was broadly ahead of where I wanted to be and I was working hard. 

Over the summer I started to skip behind. My partner and I had money troubles so I took a part-time job to earn some money. This was always part of the plan - my funding doesn’t cover anywhere near my living expenses so it was always on the cards. 

I got an apparently reliable job. But, because it was the summer there were fewer hours available. My manager promised me the max hours that I’m allowed come term time, but until then there were only two hours a day available. They didn’t have anyone else’s working. It was strongly implied if I didn’t do these hours, there were no more coming in term time. I did them. Problem was, my commute is longer than the two hours I was working, and took up one of the hours’ pay. I was losing 10-3 every single day and I still wasn’t making enough to live on. We blew through savings at an alarming rate, but term was round the corner.

Term time came and I wasn’t given more hours. Panic set in. 

In between all of this, I have had two bouts of norovirus, three of flu, one kidney infection and my first ever migraine. I have had a minor procedure to mend damage to my cervix and I’m still healing. Everything hurts. 

All of this got away from me. I was so busy worrying about everything else I didn’t notice I was doing less work every day. At some point about 8 weeks ago, I think I stopped working completely and I didn’t realise until a week ago. I think I’m about four months behind. 

I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I am vomiting from the stress of it, and I’m losing my hair (I’m female, so not pattern-related). 

Since I realised how far behind I am I’ve barely been able to get out of bed. The thought of working fills me with dread. I have a piece of work due in a week and I literally will not get it finished in time. My supervisors know there’s something going on, and know I’ve been ill. I have not said specifically how far behind I am. I’d rather focus on catching up if I can. 

I am seeing a doctor. The wait for therapy in my area is 6 months. I’ve registered for online stuff while I’m waiting. I’m dealing with the health bit. What I need from you:

What do I do now? How do I get myself back into the swing? How behind am I actually? Can I catch up?",1,2018-11-13 19:37:17
9wridg,Adjourned,t2_bi5yy,Giving up the PhD/TT dream and feeling hopeless,"Like many grad students, I have wanted to become a professor since my undergraduate days (BA, Theatre &amp; Performance). I was repeatedly supported by professors to continue on with my education. So I did. I went to a great school in my country (Canada), where I just graduated with an MA in Theatre Studies. I love my field, and I love my area of research, which is digital theatre. So the logical step was to apply to doctoral programs. I reached out to several professors in the UK, and Australia and my proposal was generally well received. So far, I have found a supervisor who loves my project at a school in the UK, and the committee handling acceptances has ""praised my proposal"". I still have a few months to apply to a few programs in Canada, but I'm afraid to keep going down this path.

I have consistently been called a career student by my family and friends for years now. On top of that, I know that the academic job market is abysmal right now, especially for humanities professors. Part of me isn't bothered by this, because I am in love with my research and my field. I literally can't see myself doing anything else with my life. On the other hand, I constantly worry about graduating, never finding a position, and feeling like a failure for the rest of my life. I know PhD grads have incredible soft-skills, but I've read so many articles/posts that say soft skills aren't enough.

I'm currently in a gap year between the MA-PhD, and I work full time in IT. I've loved computers my entire life, but I hate my job and the idea of settling for a career in something like this. I should note that I'm also a professional actor, which ties in really well with my area of study. 

What should I do? I've been struggling for months, and I've spiraled into a horrible depression. Is the job market as bleak as people make it seem? Does it even matter? Should I just give up on my dream? 

Apologies if this came off as dramatic or desperate. I just figured others in academia might share similar feelings, or may have some advice worth sharing. ",1,2018-11-13 18:13:43

adhfnx,Tim9011,t2_2xyublq5,Why I wish I'd dropped out of university,"I graduated this summer from Warwick University and thereby ended the worst three years of my life.

I studied English, after switching from history. I had seminars of 12 people in lecturers' offices no bigger than an average garden shed, a seven-hour a week timetable for 17 weeks a year, unfriendly and rarely available lecturers and tedious, rambling lectures.

University was like experiencing the shock of retirement, suddenly having hours and hours of free time to fill. The boredom and apathy that a seven-hour week induces should not be underestimated.

Having originally had hopes of a first, and marks that suggested it was possible, I eventually became de-motivated and apathetic.

If I'd got a third I would still have felt mostly relief at finishing. In my final year I had, in almost half of my 20 weeks of teaching, five hours or fewer of teaching. This is in a four-day week. Some students in my department had a three-day week.

The dearth of lectures and seminars meant they really would have had to be of a high standard to make the whole experience worthwhile, but this was not the case.

One elderly tutor would ramble, eyes shut, for an hour in a way only loosely connected with the subject; one told us that seminars were all about what we could teach each other (which raised the question of what exactly she was being paid for) and left us to it; and one likeably eccentric man would hold forth on where the best tailors could be found in Modena, and other sundry irrelevant subjects.

In my three years, only two of my courses had well-run, productive, interesting seminars where there was genuine debate and interest.

When perusing league tables, remember that they bear little relation to actual life at the university. I was taught in the English and history departments, which are rated top ten nationally. Yet I had to put up with bad organisation, paltry feedback and some incompetently led seminars. If the league tables and assessments are accurate, and Warwick really is one of the best, then national standards must be at a scandalous low.

I suspect that good performance in league tables betrays, in fact, a prioritisation of points-chasing over teaching. Certainly Warwick never misses an opportunity to get lecturers on the radio or in the papers while little is done about student depression.

The universities that are ranked highly can get away with such a small amount of teaching because they can select the students they want, meaning that the people that get in are those that don't need much teaching.

This can clearly be seen in the difference between the popular humanities, in which a ten-hour week is unusually full, and less popular science courses like engineering where struggling students receive plenty of contact time and even extra coaching.

So what lesson can be drawn? My three years at Warwick University were a waste of time. Had I known at the start what I know now I would have dropped out. If you start university and don't like the lecturers, people and culture, drop out. Go and do something that you enjoy and are enthused by. You will be doing yourself a favour.",1,2019-01-07 12:59:05

a6v04g,Murphy129129,t2_2sunz8n9,Need Advice: Supervisorial Issues/Last Year of Grad School,"A'right, I will give some background:

I'm currently a fifth year part-time PhD Candidate whose research area is niche (meaning, it's small interdisciplinary community). I am close to finishing a draft of my dissertation. 

I have been working with Supervisor A, I'll call them, for almost 4 years. Our relationship started out awkwardly. I introduced myself on email and asked if they would be interested in my project while sending out applications. I then followed this up a year later through an appointment with them. My mistake (and I totally acknowledge this) was assuming they could still be my supervisor.

It was an awkward first meeting, I was told to drop out, but contested this because I had well the first year.

Second year comes along and I do stellar on my comps, am working on my first conference paper, and submit a proposal deemed excellent. Also won a scholarship.

Our relationship had sustained itself somewhat through the year. We had monthly meetings for updates. They went on a short sabbatical at the end of my third year during which my comp exam committee member took the role of standing supervisor.

I got on well with my comps committee member. Admired their work and their advice. Conversations about my work and my progress were beneficial, even a boost when the chips were down.

Supervisor A comes back, I submit chapter 1 and 2 and have a meeting for both at separate times. By this time my comps comm member was a co-supervisor.

The second meeting went terrible. Supervisor A was cutting and at time aggressive, even in front of Supervisor B. I avoided throwing insult for insult, but the whole ordeal was completely out of context (the chapter required some amendments and a new introduction) and I must've looked pretty irritated because the news got around.

Leading up to the second meeting (6 months or so), I found single meetings with Supervisor A getting more ... awkward (in the sense that they felt hostile, but more lowkey hostile, dismissive, etc). I had won two scholarships since the original, taught quite a bit, and went to several conferences. In one meeting, my supervisor (out of the blue) asked me if my 'parents were still alive.' I answered 'yes,' but was confused at the question, since it had no context. Another meeting it wad implied I was 'crazy' and outright stated they 'couldn't wait to see (me) out of the uni.' Once again, no context. Just a regular meeting about the work. 

Hostilities are unpredictable at this point. Supervisor A gives good feedback, but I find, if I'm to be honest, it almost impossible to be in a room with them. I don't receive quality anything outside of the page from them.

On the other hand, Supervisor B has maintained support. I had a meeting with them about the issue with A, they provided full support, even concern for it's effect on my health, since I was noticeably depressed for a few months. In fact, this negative relationship has nearly put me into a deep depression and has, albeit temporary, affected my progress and desire to research, which I loved.

Any advice? I'm in fifth year and will be finishing up this draft in the coming year with a target defence date early 2020. I've managed excellent standing so far in the program and friends have encouraged me to drop A, despite some of their research area colliding with mine. 

Thanks to all for advice and for reading this through.",1,2018-12-17 01:15:42

&amp;#x200B;

I am a new PhD candidate, working on four long-term projects: two manuscripts from my Master's research, a proposal for my upcoming PhD research, and a collaborative short communication manuscript (aka, natural history note). All of these tasks have deadlines months in the future (or no deadline) and are self-paced. My struggle is that because I'm not *finishing* anything, I feel like I'm not *accomplishing* anything even if I'm making progress. This sometimes triggers episodes of crushing depression and worry that I won't meet my deadlines. Exacerbating the issue is that when I do feel like I accomplish something, the feeling is fleeting because I forget what I've accomplished. Out of sight, out of mind, as they say.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to break the big projects up into smaller tasks that I can actively check off, and I'm wondering what strategies other academics use to track their accomplishments. I think it would be especially useful to have a tool that I can look at and **visually** see the progress I've made.

Few days before this semester starts, the department either cancelled my class due to low enrollment or gave my classes away to another professor because her classes were cancelled. Apparently she needed more classes to maintain her full-time position. Felt like I was screwed over but there was nothing I could do and I was suddenly jobless and felt like a complete failure.

Having bunch of friends who are making 6 figures, buying houses, investing in real estate, having title of senior whatever on their linkedin made me feel like even bigger failure. 

Now I’m dealing with anxiety and depression, trying to find a job so I don’t go homeless. The department said I’ll be “invited back” to teach next semester but I’m debating if I even want to come back to academia. I think I’m done.

akdi3a,GotNewData,t2_33elvywf,I'm disappointed in my school and previous choices. Is it too late to become good?,"I'm a French computer engineering student, first year of master's. I will give context that I think is important, but may sound out of place for this sub. My problem is about my studies but the reasons are more personal, so if you think this would be better suited to another sub, feel free to point it out.

I grew up in a dysfunctional family, with one mentally sick (and untreated) parent, and in environments that weren't traumatizing but which I would call miserable and in which I was isolated. This led to huge socializing problems and several depressions during my studies.

I was a good student in high school without doing anything, tried to motivate myself for the two years of preparatory classes (main way of getting into grad schools in France), but quickly stopped working because of my personal problems, lack of sense of purpose, social isolation and the pressure put on me by teachers. I spent the prep classes not working and got into my current school, which is software development-oriented. While it offers a decent formation, I can't call it anything but subpar, and it has no appeal to any interesting employer. I slowly accepted that I was in a school much worse than what I could have gotten and that I wouldn't have the opportunities I would have liked.

I just got home from an Erasmus semester at one of the top universities in Europe, doing machine learning and theoretical CS, meeting people from their countries' best schools and institutes, and getting courses which interested me more than what I could have dreamed of at my home school, and I can't accept my situation anymore. I feel like my studies have been stolen from me, and while I realized how much I missed on, I slowly got into a clinical depression I'm still getting out of. I also started to hate everything about my life in my home country, and definitely don't want to stay here longer than I need to.

All I want now is to climb up. I want to switch to a more theoretical degree, in a better institution, and go towards a research engineer's position in machine learning or statistics. And while I've read and heard lots of people say that rankings don't matter as long as one does what they want, I strongly disagree and refuse to let go without doing all I can to get a reputable degree. This is as much a personal problem as a practical one; I want the same opportunities as my friends who did better schools.

I definitely feel that I'm growing up, and getting interested in fields I didn't care much about before my exchange. I'm also getting more motivated, but worrying that maybe I've waited too long and will have to do with the disappointing degree I am in. I am one year and a half from finishing my master's (with a data science major), and don't see how I could get a better degree after that, except by doing a PhD. This is an interesting option, but I'm not yet sure if it would be adequate for me.

Another option I am considering is finishing my master's in France, then trying to get into a better foreign university's master program, with a statistics or machine learning major. I don't know how selection would work in that case. I am ready to work on maths on the side to catch up with the required level, but have no idea how I could prove that I'm fit for such a program with only my degree from a low-ranked school to show. I thought about taking a gap year working as a junior data scientist or something of the sort, then applying to a list of universities with programs I'm interested in.

Overall, I'm in some kind of mid-studies crisis, regretting my low ambition, and willing to do whatever I can to compensate for it. I have no actual plan and don't know the academic system enough to know what to do. Do I still have a chance?",1,2019-01-27 16:29:23

aelqqw,Lilithiumandias,t2_duv6v,Desperately need advice about grad school applications and admissions. Please help me.,"Hello, I am in need of help and I'm not sure where to ask about this (I will be seeing the admissions officer soon). I would also like your opinions. Thank you so much in advance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 23 year old Canadian student, studying at a Canadian university in a specialized honours sociology bachelors program. I started school when I was 17, in 2013, but in a program I absolutely hated. My parents essentially forced me to go to school by threatening to kick me out (I wasn't financially stable due to financial abuse--but that's a whole other story, but will touch upon this later on in the post), so I enrolled into a program I thought I would like, but ended up hating it. My dad was very abusive during that year, and I was also in a very abusive romantic relationship. This is all in conjunction with suffering from diagnosed low-functioning ADHD and accompanying depression and anxiety. After my first year of university I had to feel my home because my safety was being threatened by my family. I took a year off, and then started and completed a 2 year college diploma from 2015 to April 2017. After that, I returned to university in September 2017 and decided that sociology sounds like exactly what I'd like to study after thorough research into it. I have been attending ever since, with my graduation date estimated at April 2022. Since I began university again I decided to seek help for what I was experiencing, and upon reflection of my first year of university, I realized that I may have ADHD. I have been getting help for my ADHD since then, and it has really shown. My first year of university grades consisted of two C's, a C+, and an F. However, the past two years, the lowest grade I've gotten was a B+ (gen eds), and for the last two years of school I expect to be getting no lower than A's, as I only have program specific courses left. My inquiry for this subreddit is regarding grad school applications, admissions, and the fact that it will take me 8 years to finish my bachelors. Will this affect my application? I believe that I could be successful in grad school because I have the ability to (considering my grades now), and an immense desire to. I love academia, and I especially love writing, as it's been my passion and hobby, so I believe I could do it, and it is my main goal in life currently. I'm worried that because it took me twice as long to finish a bachelors that it would affect my application and admission into a program. In Canada, most grad schools only look at the grades from the last two years of your program, but I don't know if they'd question why I took classes in 2013. I estimate that my GPA for the last two years of my program will be now lower than in the high 80's. I will also be completing an undergraduate honours thesis, as well as have references from professors in sociology.  I don't know what to do about this situation, and how I would go about explaining or justifying why it took so long. I feel extremely lost and I really need advice. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

b3f1jz,TwitchingSwordhand,t2_9q1ert,I paraphrased myself in a academic paper for university. Do I have to rewrite it?,"Last semester I wrote an 10 page academic paper about academic pressure in japan and how the horrible school system there causes it for my course about school criticism.

This semester i had a course about bullying, peer pressure and how to deal with them. I wanted to right another paper about japan, because I found a lot of interesting things back then i wanted to right about, but it didn't fit the topic. 

So i started writing my next paper about suicide rates, bullying and school depression caused by the Japanese school system. Thing is 1/3 of the paper is me explaining how the school systems works again like in my last paper. Because i already wrote about it previously I ended up writing a reworded version from the last essay for my new one with 3 overlapping sources.

I don't want to get in trouble for copying my own work, but at the same time i dont really know how to explain a school system and it's flaws in a whole different way. Is using different sources, that say the same thing enough or is there a different way to write about the exact same thing?

b1fgzx,Experimentalphone,t2_24o20tpg,What subject should I do my PhD in Economics in if I am bad at math but I want to become an academic with good marketable skills?,"Non-native English speaker here. 

I am a South Asian and I have a BS in Economics and an MBA. I currently work as a universal banker at a bank and I have three research papers in the pipeline along with a blog on Economics. I plan to pursue a PhD in economics. 

I hate math and I was always bad in math. But after I developed OCD I could not follow the long math like Calculus which were 10 pages long in MS in Economics. So I failed in the math courses in my BSEEE so switched to BSECON, failed math courses but got a good grade since I got the highest marks in all other courses and then switched from MSECON to MBA because I failed at math courses. But I really like Economics, especially the theoretical and philosophical parts and my papers and blog are on those type mostly. 

I want my degree to provide me with marketable skills such that after graduation I can get into a career that is in high demand worldwide and thus is in immigration lists, pays decently to maintain a family like other South Asians do, has good work conditions, the ability to switch if you have bad bosses or coworkers and fits in with my disability. 

I have OCD, Social Anxiety and Depression for the past decade and it has been very treatment resistant so I have been told to take it as a disability and build my life around it. I have trouble in the social functionality only because I have trouble with eye contact and cannot hold eye contact conversation. I face prejudice, discrimination regularly. 

I absolutely hate my current job, its conventional work with no innovation/creativity that is full of multitasking and lots of work for 11 hours five days a week. I am out of home from 8am till 10pm. Then there are sales visits during weekends. Customers are demeaning to service workers and coworkers tend to throw work my way because of my passivity and the new boss is bad. 

I believe that being an academic or researcher would suit me well. Very less politics, no bad bosses, can switch from bad bosses, less abusive and prejudicial coworkers, less need for social interaction and customer service etc. 

In Economics I have a wide range of interest, especially of using economic analysis in other disciplines, like space, AI, policy suggestions, IT etc. My papers are in various modes of publishing and they are on such topic. Not only that I also maintain a blog about such topics when my thoughts are not suitable for the narrow focus on journals. 

Anyways, I would like to get advice that given my situation what subject should I do my PhD in. Any suggestions or advice? ",11,2019-03-15 14:15:41

That being said, I still have temptations to watch porn everyday, and it takes a huge mental toll on me. Add to that the academic pressures, and I am just scared, to be honest, that it will negatively impact my career too much. Do you watch porn? If yes/no, how do you cope with it?

b059lk,throwaway-129832,t2_3e65e0px,I don't know whether or not to keep working with my PI,"I'm an undergraduate whose published two papers with my PI, a professor a really good tech school in the US.

Last year, the lead author for one of my papers lied to me about authorship in our paper right as she was submitting our camera-ready version of our paper. I pushed no further because I wanted to trust her. At our conference, however, I realized that the reasons she cited earlier where completely non-existent: she just straight up lied to keep her name at the top of the paper. Plus, she didn't tell me at all about presentations she was having about our work, before completely botching them and completely embarrassing us all in front of our lab's professors. I told my PI about it and later he said he had 'the talk' with her on the subject.

I spoke to a few other professors around our campus about this and they all said the same thing about the situation: you're right to be angry about it, this was unethical, etc. One even said this issue is grounds to no longer allow this person to work in our lab.

Now, I'm not generally a vindictive person but I feel like my colleague 'got away' with a huge lie. It's bothered me so much that she's been trusted with more and more impactful and high-profile work by our PI. While, at the same time, I can't even step into our lab without feeling an unbelievable amount of anxiety. I've also developed a serious depression (and the related issues) stemming from this situation. It just feels completely wrong that we're both on two completely different sides of this coin.

I feel like my PI doesn't respect me or my contributions to our paper. I feel like he has a clear favoritism towards the colleague that lied to me. And, the very environment of the lab triggers me every time I go there, even months after all this went down. However, I absolutely love the work we do, it's what I've searched for a long time. I don't know what to do anymore. Any advice is appreciated.",3,2019-03-12 08:18:17

axf7jn,thro0away12,t2_2prckadt,Things to consider when my undergrad and masters are sub 3.5,"My undergrad degree is technically a professional doctorate (I got into a program after high school). My grades starting off were good, but due to various life stressors, I developed a lot of anxiety and depression that ultimately made me graduate with a 3.25. Right before I decided to pursue my masters, my sibling passed away and it was incredibly hard for me to concentrate although I was determined to get my masters months after they passed as I was having issues finding full time employment with my previous degree and decided to go through a career change. But I really enjoyed what I studied in my masters, much more than my previous degree and even considered it would be something I might want to do a PhD in, albeit my GPA was not significantly better: a 3.3. 

At this point, I’ve decided to keep a PhD in the back of my mind because I really do need to work for some years as I have had employment issues for a while. Thankfully, after graduating I was able to get a full time a job and will be starting another job soon. I feel bad looking back at my grades; i did work very hard, did not waste time due to “partying”, but I do think I experienced burn out quickly while learning new things and wish I wasn’t afraid to reach out or seek help from a faculty member. I also suffered mildly from imposter syndrome which I think contributed to feeling like I am a poor student by default. 

However, the reason I have been interested in the PhD knowing I’m academically weak is because when we had journal clubs or other types of class activities, I think my insight really had a chance to shine. I love learning constantly, I love finding new ways to solve problems and I love contributing on various projects. What I do know is that I really liked what I learned and probably want to spend more years learning on the job. However, I’m also wondering how to overcome this limitation if I do consider to apply to PhD programs. ",1,2019-03-05 01:24:59

66zw6x,AllBoutDatSzechuan,t2_17bkuy,Is it too late for me to pursue a science?,"This is probably a really dumb, and really hopeless question. So a little about me. I'm 23, still in college. Story behind that being, I started off in CC because my folks couldn't pay for normal university. But I got good grades and transferred into a decent college as a CS major. Unfortunately my mom didn't want me moving out at 19 (I'm a girl, if the context helps). I was crushed. I fell into a major depression. Kinda dropped off the map for a while.

I tried taking a few more CC courses but my heart wasn't in it and my GPA dropped. Not much, but it took a hit. So now, I'm on my own and got accepted into a business administration program. Which works since I do run my own business. But part of me still sees this as my opportunity to follow my dreams and do something science related.

Unfortunately, I'm a little behind on math. I just finished trig. I've also never been super great at math but I'm so frigging willing to learn. Currently I'm contemplating whether to minor in biology or physics. I know the two are night and day, but I love both fields. I figure it goes two ways. If I minor in bio, I would try and pursue a masters in biotech. With physics, I know it's a little more difficult. But if I minor in physics, I want to go the astrophysics/astronomy route. 

Problem is, I'm not even sure any program would accept me with just a minor in either, especially with ZERO research under my belt. I know I really screwed up but I want to study a science. A business degree was my way into ""real"" college but it isn't satisfying my curiosity. 

Is it even worth it to minor in any of those? Will they lead anywhere at this point? Is it really too late?

63u4bm,NicNac91,t2_9sxxb,Advice on what to include in appeal letter/ petition for academic reprieve,"In 2010 I attended a local university for one semester. I was working 45 hours/week while attending full-time (3 classes). By mid-semester I had an A in one of my classes, but failed the other two. I made the idiotic mistake of not going to any of my classes and basically withdrawing from life (minus my job, I didn't want to end up homeless) due to the shame of my failures. I had very little support and no one in my family has ever been to college, so I didn't know what to do. So, it didn't surprise me at the end of the semester when I received a letter of academic suspension.

I have continued to work full-time for the past 6 years and have been seeing a psychologist for the past 3 years. I now feel like I am in a position where I can be successful in school again, in addition to only working 35 hours a week. I also am only interested in attending on a part-time basis.  

I am in the process of writing two letters, one a letter of appeal to be readmitted to this university, the second, to petition for academic reprieve which will reset my GPA because I am past the minimum 5 years.

I am wondering how much information I should include in these letters, what would be inappropriate? I am a very private person, so is it necessary to include my struggles with depression? I dread sharing any information on that topic. Also, the petition asks for any documentation to be included alongside the letter. Would it be helpful for my psychologist to contribute in some way?

For the appeal for readmission how can I explain my reasoning for essentially quitting when it got tough, because I realize now how illogical a move it was. I had options but instead I chose to avoid my problems.

I realize this is a lot of questions so if anyone has advice on even a part of it I would really appreciate it. Thanks!

I understand that arts subjects in general are difficult to find work in, but if I'm interested in popular culture, what areas of study might I be able to find a teaching niche in?

6jdr6i,dom11285,,Destroyed academic career?,"I finished my PhD in 2015, and got a job at a college on a two-year contract. As an academic, you have to be constantly researching and publishing. A major expectation is that you publish your PhD dissertation as a book soon after you get the degree. 

In revising the dissertation, I discovered what I thought were significant coding errors, and also found out that other works had been published which made it significantly less original. I began to think that the project was futile, as the coding corrections meant that the book would no longer have a clear argument. I spent months trying to find a way to rework the project, getting more and more panicked about it. This obsession led me to stop researching and publishing altogether, and I believed that I had failed and my career was over. I fell into depression. 

Convinced that it was over and that I was a failure and would be discovered as a failure, I isolated myself from my research network, and am now no longer invited onto any conference panels.

As my contract was coming to an end, and trying to run away from my PhD project, I proposed an entirely new research project in job applications. I was offered, and accepted, a one-year research fellowship at a different university on the basis of this new research project. As I have progressed in my depression counselling, I have realised that there is a justifiable basis for what I thought were my ""coding errors"" with my PhD dissertation. I now have renewed confidence in this PhD project and want to get back to it. Simultaneously, in preparing for the second project, I have discovered that the scenarios it would research are actually exceedingly remote, to the point of folly. There is new literature on this, pointing this out, that has been published since I sent in the application.

I also struggle with an oversharing problem and have to filter out most of what is actually on my mind.

I've been tutoring for a year now and these issues disappear. I genuinely enjoy talking to students and because the sole purpose is academia, I can always default to that subject without painful small talk. I end up being friendly and quirky and knowledgeable, and for the first time in my life succeed in the job even while going through the lows of depression and the highs of mania. The flexible schedule is also a lifesaver for the times that I do need a day off. At the same time, I am great at accommodating last minute requests.

I self-teach and tutor every subject in Psychology (even the ones I haven't had classes in). I absorb information quickly, have an analytical mind, love statistics and writing APA papers, and could succeed in a Master's and Ph.D program.

My questions are: Could I make a comfortable living tutoring Psychology? Should I get a Master's in General Psychology or Ph.D in IO, and how would that influence my earning potential? Would I have luck targeting wealthy families of undergraduate Psychology students or would I more than likely encounter broke doctoral students?

I feel like that if I go for a postdoc, I'll end up trapped in a job that isn't good for me, but if I don't then I've wasted the last 4 years of my life, and I'll have failed because if I go into science education or communication then I'm not really a scientist. I like education, I like coding (but I don't feel I know enough - postdocs always seem to want more requirements than I have), I like spatial analyses. I want a job that teaches me things and challenges me. I just don't know where to go. I know some of these feelings are just down to depression but I don't want to end up feeling the same way in my next job. I'm stuck in a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't. 

I'd appreciate any advice. For info, I'll be submitting my thesis at the end of october (so I imagine my viva/defence will be early january)",16,2017-08-13 10:26:09

Recently, though, I've been talking to a coworker who outside of his job is almost a near genius. I'm taken away at the breadth of knowledge the dude has of things. It's been inspiring me to pick up science again and hopefully use it as a motivation to start doing something in my life. I was curious about what anyone can tell me on how to start back into it.


I've contemplated taking some opencourseware classes on the MIT website that covers general topics like biology, chemistry, astrophysics, etc. and maybe afterwards I could find something to narrow my interests down; or possibly gather up some books instead that generally covers some scientific related topics. I could instead, maybe, find some resources that cover the sort of philosophy of science and ""how"" to understand and use it to give myself a framework for how to approach tackling any certain scientific field. I mean, these are just my suggestions but I'd like to hear from you.

78cres,WhyWearARomper,,Returning to academia after flaming out in ugrad,"Hello AskAcademia,

I am trying to figure out if it's even possible for me to make a return to academia in any way after a really bad flame out as an undergrad. In short I was a Philosophy/Physics dual major, and a combination of building depression anxiety caused me to have a pretty bad junior year where I started out around a 3.2 GPA and drove off a cliff from that point. 

Instead of seeking help I tried to make up the couple classes I had failed on top of doing all of the other senior level classes I needed. This went about as well as you think it would resulting in me outright failing 6 classes that year, losing weight to the point I barely had the energy to leave my bed, and being on the verge of suicide multiple times. I graduated with only my philosophy degree and the smoldering crater of my 2.4 GPA.

I found my way into an IT job and spent the last five years working my ass off to land in my current spot as an SRE (mix of software/systems engineering) at a well known financial company.

I know I have the aptitude to succeed at school now that I have years of experience and my other issues under control, I'm just not sure if it's even possible to go back at this point or what path to take. My company will pay tuition if I want to do another undergrad degree or post-bacc/masters in Computer Science, but obviously my GPA basically makes the latter two impossible, and the first one extremely difficult.

I want to take a second shot at this, and I really want to move into research someday if possible. As far as ever getting into a good school for graduate work, at this point how can I even go about that?

As far as I can tell, the only option I have that might even yield a small chance of success would be starting over as a non-degree student somewhere and taking classes until I can maybe get some kind of GPA waiver to get into a decent undergrad program (raising my GPA to the 3.0 required at most schools would basically require the credit amount of finishing a second bachelors already), then possibly transferring to a better school after performing well enough at the first. Even if I were able to do this, is my original undergrad GPA going to be a massive ball and chain I'm going to lug around forever in academia?

I've dipped my toes in already, and took a first year computer science class for majors as well as a discrete structures class at a CUNY school and did extremely well in both.

Any input is appreciated, and I have been thinking about this for a few years at this point. This is something I really want to do, I'm hoping you guys can provide some insight into what steps I should take.

Thanks!",14,2017-10-24 02:13:40
751bia,shouldidoaphd,,PhD as an escape,"Hello all. I’m going to start applying for grad school soon I’m a bit concerned about the actual reason I’m getting a PhD for. I’ve realised that I’m not going for it because I’m extremely passionate about my subject but because I don’t want to lead the so-called ‘normal’ lives that my friends and family are living. I want to use it as an escape to stay out of the ‘real-world’ for as long as possible.

The rat-race disgusts me. A lot of my childhood friends have just got corporate jobs and it saddens me to see them brag about their salaries and cool new offices like little kids. All of them and my family think that I’m an idiot for not trying to get a corporate job when I have so much potential. They think anyone who isn’t constantly trying to maximise the amount of money they make is an idiot and that really pisses me off. My father works in a pretty big company and he’s probably the most miserable person I’ve ever met in my life. I’d like to be rich too but not just for the heck of it, but by achieving something truly significant and that I can be proud of.

I’ve also been suffering from depression for the past few years and I’ve realised that when I’m in the library in my university working on a problem, I forget all about it. Even if I don’t enjoy it that much, using all of my mental faculties to focus on solving something makes me rise above the bullshit that surrounds me and makes me feel less alienated. This probably is because I’m an introvert who has cut out most of his friends and family from his life. When I’m working on a problem, keeping myself busy, nothing else concerns me. Which is why I think I can do this for the rest of my life.

Does any of this sound familiar to any of you? Should I go for a PhD with this mindset or am I bound to fail?",19,2017-10-08 12:05:05

7eel0v,Mct0045,,Should I pursue a masters degree?,"Hello, I hope I am asking this in the right sub. I’m a single 30/f mother of a 7 year old who has a job as a marketing rep for a restoration company. I decided to go back to school to finish my Bachelor’s degree in business leadership, which I’m on track to do in just 9 months (I had 36 hours to complete.) I’m doing well, A’s if I put in moderate effort, B’s if I’m putting in minimal effort. With my completion of the program less than 4 months away, I’ve been thinking of getting an MBA with a concentration in Management or Marketing. To complete one of these programs at my current college (public university), it will cost me about $12,600. Is it worth it? 

In a personal aspect, just the fact that I’d have a graduate degree would be a major accomplishment for me. Starting in 2006 until 2009 I was in a severely abusive relationship, escaping only by running away one night while my boyfriend went to the gas station. Then just months after escaping I got very unexpectedly pregnant by a guy I had just started dating. I gave birth to a baby boy who required immediate open heart surgery when he was less than a day old, followed by 3 brain surgeries over the next 14 months, frontal lobe brain damage, and an epilepsy diagnosis. Then I was diagnosed with a female condition and struggled with my own health. Was sexually assaulted that year, and spiraled into a major state of depression, battled PTSD, and panic disorder. I ended up getting dependent on my pain and anxiety meds, and by 2014 I was homeless, unemployed and my parents were taking care of my son (his dad ditched by the time he was a year old) while I dwindled my savings. An old friend offered me a place to stay and I took a job waitressing at a strip club for 2 months. Met a good guy, quit the terrible job, started slowly putting my life back together, got engaged, and got the job I have now. Said “good guy” walked out on me without warning or reason one random day two months before our wedding. I moved back in with my parents and I promised myself and my son that we would never depend on another man ever again. I enrolled in school, started in June of this year and graduate with my Bachelor’s degree in March. I didn’t think I’d come this far, but here I am. And getting a graduate degree would be like accomplishing something I haven’t thought possible for myself since I was an ambitious teenager. In the personal sense, $12,600 of debt for a graduate degree is worth every. single. cent. 

But I have to be rational, and if career wise getting an MBA will not open up opportunities for me that I wouldn’t otherwise have, then I can’t justify pursuing one. So is getting an MBA truly worth it? I make chump change at my current job...$14/hr with no benefits. Just having my Bachelor’s degree should increase my annual earnings by at least $10,000. How much more could I expect to make with an MBA? I definitely appreciate any and all feedback.

7v43og,Tig3rDawn,,"Career Advice: I'm stuck in a rut after getting my B.S. in Astrophysics, what's next?","I graduated with a B.S. in Physics with a concentration in Astronomy from a state school in California in 2016, and while I love my job selling telescopes for now, I don't know where to go from here.

A bit of back story (skip to end if you don't want to hear the sob story): When I was in high school I thought I wanted to work in theater, but by the end, I wasn't so enthused anymore. After a lot of soul searching I decided on physics, specifically astrophysics, which I had loved since I was a small child. I was living in my car at the time, but I decided to enroll in community college and give it a go. I figured if I didn't make it in physics, I could switch majors to geology and move forward from there. I spent a few years eking by at a local community college. While there I found that they didn't offer the classes I need very regularly, but I could finish a transfer degree with a focus on physics in three years. Three semesters before I was supposed to finish, I got into a major car accident. The only reason I'm mentioning this is because, while I was already playing catch-up on math because of my ill-conceived plans of being a Broadway star, the head injury I sustained in the accident set me back even more. Skip forward a little and the community college I was attending decided to stop offering some of the classes I needed to transfer. No one told me I could make those up at a 4 year (still not sure if I could have or not, but it's moot now), so I moved to Berkeley and finished my transfer degree and got into a State school.

I spent a lot of my time at state very alone, very poor, and very hungry. I struggled with literal starvation, as well as serious depression and anxiety to the point where my grades plummeted BUT I STILL MANAGED TO GRADUATE. Very aware that I was not mentally or physically fit enough to continue onto my PhD (not to mention I was too broke to even afford to take the GRE), I returned home to Washington where I grew up. It's been almost two years since I graduated, and I have a really fun job selling telescopes. Now that I'm healthy again I'm starting to look forward at what I want for a career. There's a lot of programming jobs in the area that pay a lot more than I'm making now, that with a little work I could easily qualify for, but what I really want to do is look for exoplanets. I know this requires that I get my PhD, but that's more or less the extent of my knowledge of how to move forward.

Here's the rub: I spent so much time moving around I never really made any connections or learned how this career path works. Also, I've never managed to work on any real projects, no internships, no senior project, nothing and on top of that I'm the breadwinner for the house, so I can't take unpaid opportunities. I can program a little, I'm great at writing papers, I'm good at astronomy, I'm decent at calculus, but I'm terrible with people. So I'm asking where do I go from here?

I know I need to take the GRE and apply to PhD programs, but what do I need to do to get into those programs besides take the GRE? Would a programming job help my chances of long term employment more than continuing to work at the telescope store where I have a flexible schedule (which i assume will be helpful when I'm in school)? Are there things that my current path of telescope sales would fit better with than looking for exoplanets? How do I find a mentor? do I even need one? Are there other questions I should be asking but don't know to?",9,2018-02-04 02:44:02
7uyqno,Atkrista,,Looking for a non-traditional career change!,"First of all sorry for the long post. So background I'm a CS graduate currently unemployed. I believe most people looking for a change in career switch form physics to CS due to better job prospects. I'm sort of on the other boat. I have always been interested in physics and was looking at getting a bachelors in physics after high school. But I chose CS(first mistake) because I thought that I'd be better employable. But the possibility of taking physics as a career never left my mind. Soon after starting college I was diagnosed with ADHD and mild depression and started medication for depression. The ADHD was never treated because its medication is illegal in our country. Few semesters passed and I started getting more and more disillusioned with my studies. My grades suffered as a result and I graduated with a mere 3.0 GPA mostly due to the saving grace of the many lab courses I took.

So now after a year off studies I'm reevaluating my priorities and really asking myself what I really want to do in life. As my grades are bad grad school for CS isn't really an option. I could study for PGRE but I took like 2 courses in Physics(choosing wasn't an option) Engineering Physics and Electromagnetics so I'm not cracking that nut. Right now I'm really considering going for a second bachelors in physics and then see how it goes from there. But there is a chance I might not do so well and also not enjoy it as much as I thought would.

Are there any people here who went from CS to physics?I could really use some advice right now.

All the postdocs (about 4) are leaving the lab after simmering disputes with my PI.

I suspect there are many things I'm willing to compromise on that the others cannot.

Things are not going well for me in terms of research output, and I don't quite know why. That everyone else is leaving makes me wonder if it's not just my problem. My failure to be productive, however, has made me feel like I do not deserve to stay in the field any longer. I am not contributing. I have low life quality. 

I truly cannot tell whether my depression and anxiety is a product of my abilities or a function of how I have been treated (the cause of everyone else's leave?). And now that I have heard too much about how the others feel about the boss, from now on I'll be walking on eggshells.

Without revealing too much, my PI built his team about 4 years ago, after his own postdoc. He recruited about 6, 7 postdocs &amp; faculty and a few PhD students under multiple grant schemes. In the last six months, all the postdocs and some of the faculty are leaving or have left, except for me.

I have written this letter in hopes of conveying the gravity with which I regard my academic future and the steps I have taken to remedy my current academic standing.

Before enrolment as a transfer student in 2016 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism.I went through a few doctor visits and was put on Levothyroxine medication which did at the time help with the depression and anxiety symptoms. In fall 2017 semester is when my refills of the medication went out , at this time is when I would start seeing the symptoms again.As a result of being off medication my stress and anxiety started to build up as it was the first semester in which I took more than 4 classes. This gave me constant insomnia, troublesome fatigue walking to class and constant just streaks of depression with academic scores not being met to standards that were I wanted them. At this time I did not seek any counselling for my depression and anxiety. In september though the end of the academic year I would see my advisor for academic advice on my major, as well as an attend academic peer coach session which started on 10/17/17 which in a way did help with insecurities about my academic decline. I have sought treatment for these issues and am currently on a new insurance plan and will have funds to buy more levothyroxine for my hypothyroidism in order to help my depression and anxiety symptoms. Appointments have been made on 1/9/18 to see a counselor for my depression issues until I am able to receive medication after my doctor check up in later date january. I have come up with an academic plan with my advisor which will enable me to make better academic decisions a choices in order to graduate in my major. I have also dropped my course load from 5 classes to 4 per semester and will be taking a break from accounting for a semester in replacement with an elective course as to not work myself which could result in an anxiety attack or stress overload. I have already started to attend harc in university suites center and will continue to go weekly as well as make tutoring appointments in academic success center as the semester workload starts to kick backup.

Many faculty members have been with the department for decades, thus, there exists a lot of institutionalized dysfunction. 

We recently began a search for a new department chair. However, a few members of the department (the bad apples) completely scared off the first choice for the position. As far as I know, she actually cited these 3 individuals as the primary reason why she wouldn't take the position, and even went so far as to say that she would gladly take it if the college removed them.

I've struggled with sporadic bouts of depression due to the change in environment. The university that I came from was completely different in that it was professional and drama free. Here there is a lot of negativity, rumor spreading, and one of these individuals has been verbally hostile towards me recently. 

Within the department, I work for a researcher who is mostly insulated from the dysfunction. Therefore, I'm somewhat insulated as well.

Im writing in part because I needed to vent to my peers anonymously. I'm also hoping to gain some insight as far as how I should handle interactions with these individuals.

I've been working on this one project in astrophysics for close to 3 years now. We've had continual problems, and each time I fix one issue, it feels like 3 more take its place. To begin with I was really excited about this project, I'm still excited about the field, but after working on this for 3 years, I just f\*cking hate it. 

I mean I'd normally enjoy the work, but the fact that I'm just continually revisiting the same sh\*t over and over again is wearing me thin. I did the majority of this coding work as a freshman with no programming experience, and that's the code that I realistically have to work with now. It's just terrible, but it mostly gets the job done and I can't justify the months it'd take to learn rigorous programming practices in order to bring it up to industry standards. 

I just want to publish and move on with research, but this is haunting me and it keeps needing further clarification. Tiny errors or marginal uncertainties keep cropping up that'll take me a full week's worth of work to do, and I'm supposed to be on holiday for the next 2 months. At this point, seeing an email about it immediately brings me to tears. I just cry. It's burnout, but only for this one project and nothing else. 

What am I supposed to do about this? It desperately needs to be published, but the emotional cost is just getting higher and higher and I'm predisposed to emotional instability (depression, anxiety, hallucinations, etc). 3 years of looking at the same numbers has worn me thin. This experience is just hell for me, there's no other way to describe it at this point. But it's publishable work to a first-author standard, so I really have to keep going.

I know how stupid this may sound to a normal person who hasn't experienced this.   

So I have this Professor, who always without fail, shows up to ""give a lecture"". But all he does is humiliate and belittle students.  I am talking about things like making you stand for the whole lecture. March around the auditorium. Writing on sheets of paper and having us hold labels for the whole lecture. Written on the papers will be statements like ""I am stupid"". He also says things like ""you should hang yourself"", if one of us doesn't answer correctly. He isn't your typically angry person. That is the worst part. He does all this methodically. Like some sadist.  

Right now, after seeing the schedule, I'm just anxious at the prospect of his lecture. Even if its a few weeks later.  

If I think rationally, I know that the worst he can do is fail me, or kill me or something along those lines. But that will never happen at the lecture. But why am I worried then? All I have to do is endure his abuse for 1 hour at a time. Then its done and dusted.  

And still I worry.  

I know these things aren't supposed to happen in the 21st century. But thats how it goes here. If I say anything, I'll be the bad person.I'll be the one at risk to lose my certification. I'll be the one that will be ridiculed by the higher ups. Or even my peers, who may see me as a ""wuss"".

83a3he,justletmestudy,,My dream of academia won't die - a cry for help,"I've decided to post here because I just don't know where else to go with my despair, so hopefully someone will have an experience that can speak to mine. 

Between 2014 to 2015 I completed an M.A. in Literature, Culture, and Theory at a prestigious university in the UK, finishing with top marks. In that same year, I fell madly in love with my partner, and upon graduating, moved to his home country of Singapore because he had a solid job offer and I didn't. At the time, there was a small voice in me warning that I might regret not staying in London and applying for a PhD, because I was in an excellent position to do so, and moreover, international students like myself have limited opportunities given the challenges of visas, etc. I stifled the voice, being too desperate to be with my partner to really care at that point. In Singapore I soon found work as a market researcher. The job killed my soul, but couldn't quit because I'm not independently wealthy and wasn't sure I could find anything better. 

At the same time, I began to hate living in Singapore and my partner and I discussed moving abroad, possibly to Canada or the U.S. My partner had previously expressed ambitions of pursuing a PhD in a STEM subject, so I pushed him to apply and eventually helped him find a research project and supervisor, which he is currently pursuing here in Toronto. 

Having moved three times in three years, it's been absolutely exhausting for me. I've been unemployed for 8 months because of the dire job market here. My partner readily acknowledges that I've been extremely supportive of his career, and is willing to do what he can to help me. I recently just accepted an offer from a community college to do a publishing certificate in September - but I don't know if it's what I want to do.

Here's the thing - I've been extremely depressed, to the point of feeling suicidal, ever since I left the academic world. I have always loved the humanities profoundly, loved the reading and the writing and the grappling with difficult concepts, and it feels like ever since I left in 2015 I have slowly been dying. To be fair, I have struggled with depression all my life, but when I still had my books and my professors and my classes, the despair of everyday living was held at bay. My mind and body felt alive, as long as they were preoccupied with intellectual inquiry. 

My professors always knew me as a bit of a model student due to my grades, but I'm actually not very professionally ambitious. I can't actually see myself as a professor, never even gave it a thought really. I'm not even sure I have the grit and determination to get through a PhD (and it seems like a terrible idea given the precarious job market). I just long to be back in the academic environment again, belong in a community where people understand what I am thinking and talking about. I want to be able to do nothing all day but learn, to no end, without end. Is there any way I can 'get back' to all this? Without necessarily taking on a PhD or another degree that I can't afford? I'm reading and attempting to keep up with discussions on my own, but it's just not the same - I constantly feel anxious and lonely. 

I know I sound incredibly naive and self-indulgent, but please be kind. My problems obviously don't all stem from the fact that I left the university, but learning and scholarship has been my greatest source of comfort all these years. I've started down the path of self-harm, and I'm really afraid that I have started to unfairly resent my partner for the choices that I chose to make.

Thanks for reading this far. ",10,2018-03-09 21:00:29
82nklp,myfirstsfwaccount,,Asking for an extension of my dissertation deadline,"Not sure if this is the right place for this but here goes 

My undergrad dissertation is due 12th April 2018 
I have been dealing with depression, anxiety and insomnia for the majority of this academic year so I registered with the disability service and was able to get a 7-day extension on my dissertation (from 5th April) 
I'm receiving treatment, and have managed about 3500 words so far, but I seem to be getting worse again and the physical symptoms are pretty bad right now, so I feel unwell most of the time 
I have a doctors appointment on Friday to see if there's anything else wrong with me/anything can help me, but would it be unreasonable to ask for a note and contact uni to see if I could get a further extension. 

Also, the regular deadline has just been extended to 10th April because of the bad weather and strikes, if that matters
Should I ask for an extension or just load up on painkillers and caffeine and attempt to power through?

7ziaeq,acacacademia,,Pushing Forward- Anxiety in Academia Advice?,"So I haven’t really used this forum before, but I’m hoping to find advice.

I’m in my last semester of my undergrad in Bioinformatics and Computer Science, and I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for about 7 years now. I know that this is a common thing in the sciences, so it’s safe to assume that someone out there in my field has been in the same boat. 

I’m finding it so hard to keep going. I had a plan when I first got accepted into my programs, I was going to get published by 20 and get accepted into a master’s program and T.A. to cover my tuition. But an inability to hold down 2 part time jobs and research while remaining a full time student pursuing 2 degrees, along with supporting my family and the occurrence of a personal trauma led to everything toppling down this time last year. My GPA plummeted, I couldn’t complete my research project, and I lost my jobs. Now I just want to graduate and end strong and obtain a job in industry. I keep trying to recover, I had an internship over the summer that went really well, and that was great, but the fall semester did not go the way I needed it to, and I’m recognizing the same patterns for this semester. I’ve so many late assignments, and I feel anxiety over the assignments that I haven’t finished every time I start on a different one, and I don’t know how to be productive anymore. I had started taking medication for anxiety last September, but it severely limits my ability to read, which sounds weird but I’ve found it can take about 3 times as it normally would to process the information, which obviously hinders my ability to do the work that necessitates the medication.

I guess I’m just looking for someone to say that they went through something similar, maybe supply an uplifting story and some strategies to get on track.

Thanks!

7yismj,TerlyAnderson,,"Help- PhD not supporting living in my city, and I don't feel right about it","Hi all,


I'm really stressed out right now because I'm in my first year of a PhD program where the stipend is simply not meeting the cost of living in my expensive, tech-booming west coast city. What's extra stressful is that this is my second time trying out a PhD program at this university. The first time, I was feeling anxious, isolated, and unhappy so I left after I had my MS. After a year of doing other research out of school, I realized that I was still very passionate about science, and decided to give it another go. I know a lot of people believe in me, and my academic progress is going very well- in fact, I'm on track to graduate in 3 years. But I'm struggling so much with my wellness and the discomfort of not quite making it in my city. I’m getting more and more depressed and sleepless (I am seeing my campus’ psychiatrist about this). 


I live relatively frugally- I have 6 housemates and my car is 12 years old. Because rent is so high where I live, though, I’m out several hundred dollars each month. Going into my program, I anticipated being able to make it because other students were. But I’m realizing that many of my classmates are actually supported by a partner or their parents (although, there is generally a lot of depression and discomfort in the cohort for other reasons). My stress is not just because I’m working way overtime trying to do enough outside work to make up the difference, but also because I don’t feel totally right with this morally. I understand that graduate school is low-income for everyone, and it never bothered me in my previous graduate program when I had a bit of a margin every month. But I also know that my work as a researcher and a course instructor is beneficial to my lab, my department, and the university, and for me to do this as a full-time job, I believe I should be paid at least enough to live healthily. Then again, I know that not every grad student is in the same situation- people in humanities make even less than I do as a STEM student.


I’ve been very vocal with my department and advisors about this and they all say the department simply has no extra funds. I am already on a federal grant which they cannot supplement very much. My advisers aren’t rude, but don’t seem to be taking this extremely seriously, because they all remember being poor in grad school. I have looked at even cheaper housing, but I’m just not that comfortable with it- I can go a bit cheaper, but it means moving into places that are considerably more rundown or make my commute ~2 hours per day. I can also keep doing outside work, but I’m getting really burned out doing this. 


Here’s what I feel badly about:


1)	I can probably finish my degree in another 2 years, so maybe I should stick it out so I can just have the title and move on. The research is going well enough. But I feel gross about this situation.


2)	Other people make do on very, very little and survive this, so what does it say about me if I can’t? I could make even further sacrifices- move into an even more basic living situation, switch to using a food bank for my groceries, and keep doing supplemental work even if it’s difficult. I could take out a loan. If I’m not willing to make those additional sacrifices, does it mean I wasn’t really committed to this PhD?


3)	Since this is my second go-around trying a PhD program at my university, I’m worried that because my university took another chance on me after I left one program, I owe it to them to complete this. Especially because other people find ways to make it work. 


**TL;DR:** I know grad students are supposed to be poor, but I don’t feel right about the fact that I’m making less than it costs to live in my city and having to make sacrifices that affect my health, wellbeing, and comfort. I’m seeking some perspectives and stories about this issue.

4g3l1l,jesuisperdu,t2_61gcm,"[UPDATE] After eight years of PhD, I'm consumed by fear, I don't think I can finish. I've lost myself and my confidence. I just woke up crying. I desperately need help.","Dear AskAcademia,


It was 9 months ago that I poured my heart out here and you guys read my words and gave me the strength I needed to push forward [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/3eb7aa/after_eight_years_of_phd_im_consumed_by_fear_i/). **Thank you!!!**

I wish my update was exclusively happy, but an interaction that I had yesterday with my advisor has made it bittersweet, and I'm still trying to make sense of it. I'll give you the full story.


After my last post, I read ALL of the books you guys recommended. What can I say? They were fantastic! I learned to be mindful and my depression went away, I learned how to make good habits and get rid of bad ones, I lost the few extra pounds I had gained due to eating when anxious, and I stopped, cold-turkey, taking Prozac. I felt good and I managed to **finish my thesis!!!** It has gone through my committee, and it is now with the board of examiners (I don't know the proper name in English, but the doctors who will evaluate me when I defend my thesis). I have received 3 postdoc offers from researchers in my Institute, and even my advisor has offered me two different postdoc options to continue with him.


However, *this will become very relevant*, I took out a loan to cover my food and rent expenses during all these months. Juggling working while trying to finish my thesis and publish all of my chapters (which my advisor insisted I do) was a huge source of stress. My advisor likes to see us in the lab all day, so I always felt guilty while at work.


The day before yesterday, a colleague sent me a link to a postdoctoral research fellow position in Europe and, when I read it, I could not believe it! I'm a good candidate for it, since I have all the essential attributes they listed and most of the desirable ones. Also, their line of research is very interesting and in the direction I want to go, more conservation. And yet, I was not considering doing a postdoc outside of the city I'm currently at, because my husband is here working on his PhD and needs a couple more years to finish. However, the money for this postdoc is 3 times as much as the money I can get for a postdoc in my country, and I could pay the money I owe to the bank. Also, it starts this summer, whereas the call for postdocs in my country comes out until January, and I won't start working until June of next year.


I spent hours talking with my husband about me doing this postdoc. I hadn't told him how much money I owed, or how the interests are pilling up, because I did not want to burden him. I've already put a lot of stress on him because of the depression I went through. He was very supportive and understanding. He told me he would figure out how to get the money, but I asked him not to. His student scholarship is just enough for him and he is already overworked. He said that I should apply, that I needed to get away from my advisor and that I would be some sort of Phoenix and become great again, like I once was. That he would visit me whenever he could. I cried, we hugged for hours and I decided to apply. It was not an easy decision, my husband is my life.


Yesterday I started the application process. I felt confident with our decision and excited about the possibility of being accepted. Then I reached the part in which they asked me for the contact details of my current boss. I filled that part out and decided to let him know that, if they considered me a good enough candidate to interview, that they might call him. What happened next killed me. Perhaps I'm oversensitive or he is an ass**le, maybe both.

I asked him if he had a few minutes and he took me to his office. I explained that I wanted to apply for a postdoc and gave him the specifics, told him that I consider myself a good candidate and, that if they thought so too, they might give him a call. I'll try to quote him as best as I can:

Him: ""You're skilled, but you're slow. When they call me and ask me why it has taken you so long to deliver, what am I going to say to them? It is a highly competitive position, and they are looking for someone who delivers in reasonable time.""


I felt so little. He sounded aggressive and I couldn't understand why. I felt broken again and crushed. Yes, it will take me 9 years to graduate, I once heard that the average time for his students is 8 years. Yet I have more manuscripts than any of his other students, 4 as first author and 3 as second author. 


When he said that, I felt that I had to justify myself. And while I was struggling to do so, I felt like a toddler trying to form coherent arguments and failed. At least, I didn't cry. If you guys are interested, or if you think it is relevant, I'll try to remember what I said and all the other hurtful things he said next.


But this interaction with him has made me doubt myself again. I now imagine myself alone very far away from my husband, in a very cold place, and wonder if I can actually do it. I know that what they need of me, won't be easy, and I'll need to work very hard to get it done. 


To make me doubt even more, it will be in the Country where my advisor was born, what if I get another advisor like him? But honestly, after how this conversation went, I don't think I'll be accepted. I know he won't spare the flaws he sees in me, and he is a harsh judge. 


I'm left wondering if his reaction is normal, do advisors commonly act like this when you're graduating and looking to move on? Is he worried that I'll embarrass him if I don't deliver? I don't think its personal because I'm sure he does like me. We get along quite well as long as he is not revising my work. Though my husband has mentioned stockholm syndrome. 


I'm lost. Should I apply?


**EDIT**


**You people are beautiful!!!**

I've read ALL of your comments and upvoted them. They were all full of awesomeness, and u/Respectfullyyours even called me a ""Hero"". Thank you :)

You were all unanimous, and I've decided to **APPLY!**

4fyhps,ihaveatoaster,t2_xcgrk,My boyfriend wants to become a professor. Should I dump him?,"My boyfriend recently defended in a field with robust industry representation at a jaw-dropper school. In the past couple months or so, I have gone through relationship hell and don't know what this is, what I am, what he is, or what planet we are living on.

He has (medicated) depression and personal standards which cannot coexist with a debilitating mental illness. Prior to the thesis crunch (also, more or less when we started dating), he was a normal person. Sure, he was a little reticent and prone to melancholic contemplation, but he went hiking, threw parties, he had friends. Now, he has no support system outside of myself and his parents (and he doesn't want the latter). His social activity of the week is going to the gym. He works 9-10 hours a day, and mopes the rest of the time because he can't sleep. We've also had an episode of self-harm and an episode of suicide ideation. We're in some kind of contact every day, but I get pissed off when he can barely muster 2.5 sentences in 24 hours. He's still very sweet with me, but he's not affectionate, he doesn't do nice things for me anymore, and it's impossible to get him to do anything but work. I told myself I'll break up with him as soon as he defends, but now I'm reconsidering because I do care for him and think that he's objectively and subjectively a total package, if he weren't such a total knobhead.

While typing this out on the relationship subs, I've come to terms with my thoughts and emotions, and came to the conclusion that I could stand his constant exhaustion, his occasional self-sabotage, his lacking communication and sexual function if only I believed in his mission, but I don't. I am girlfriend-level familiar with his field and approximately intimately familiar with academia, and from my observations, for him to get from where he is to where he wants to be, it will take nothing short of a miracle. I can't tell him this because he knows it too, and also because hearing it from me might crush him, so I've been steadily advertising how great life is in industry (6 figures! Geographical mobility! You can take weekends off!), but so far, his response has been that industry is for lesser beings. What's frustrating is that he'd actually be really good in industry because he's not an acneous nerd, and he actually knows how to talk to people without getting punched in the face. I'm not a gold digging whore and I understand that he has to live out his dream to the lastest, but his postdoc is another 2 years, and when that's done, who's to say he won't get another one? He's also not getting any younger, and I'm scared that he'll miss out on the things he wants to do, like travel and buy non-sale items, in favor of a dream that will never pan out. Lastly, I don't know if I can survive this. I already got a therapist for my own issues, but 50% of that very expensive hour is spent ranting about my beloved non compos mentis. And it's not like I can get that shit comped, you know?

If it helps, he's also a pedant, an aesthete, a germaphobe, and a picky eater, which is mildly annoying.

NB: please don't ask for any names, because academics are thick as thieves and I'd bet money that some of you here know or have heard of him.",0,2016-04-22 13:41:35
4fnkm1,somethrowaway231,t2_x50bf,[United States] Undergraduate wanting to going back to school to get a bachelors in another field.,"Hello /r/askacademia,
           I’m really hoping to get some guidance from you on going back to college. Two years ago I graduated from a university with a B.F.A. (Bachelors of fine arts) and now two years later I’m living at home with my parents working a part time job. I have gotten nowhere and just come to terms that I really need to go back to college and get something better. Now let me tell you about myself so people can get a little insight; I’m in my early twenties, my major focused on animation, and I live in the United States. After  graduating I was planning on working on my portfolio but it hasn't gotten anywhere because of going into depression/inability to concentrate on one things. I'm really tired of being that person.

I’ve decided to go into accounting and am planning to get a master in the program. While my parents are supportive and excited for me I have no idea on where to start. I’ll have to get a bachelor in accounting but hoping to take a lot of classes at a community college to help save some money. Would I contact the community college or the university first? Who should I talk to help me plan/transfer? If anyone took classes originally at a community college then transferred over to a university what was it like for you? Is there any stuff I should know to be sure that credits transfer? I now live in a different state from where I got my B.F.A., would that cause any problems in transfers? If anyone has tips on planning for going back to college that would be helpful too. 

I’ll be sure to add some more questions once I think of some more. Sorry for the dumb questions but I really been having a hard time finding experiences from undergraduates who are going back to get a degree in a different field. Thank you to anyone who answers any of these questions.

4reoz7,physical_kryptonite,t2_qrcd9,Is it normal for Masters projects to be kind of...piddling? (x-post /r/cscareerquestions),"I'll be honest, I kinda bullshitted my way through my Masters. The only reason I really went to grad school was because I was having trouble finding jobs (this was in 2010, when the economy was still kinda shitty). However, literally within 2 weeks of starting my coursework, I realized I just didn't want to be there. It was a combination of a bunch of different factors, really - depression, loneliness, lack of motivation, lack of interest. However, I dragged myself kicking and screaming through it and finally finished my MS.  

For my thesis, I had to do a project. The project I did was, admittedly, kinda unimpressive. I just modified a few open-source Android apps. In fact, both of them were also projects by students as well. One of them was this bare-bones navigation app written by students at some small university in France. It's been downloaded fewer than 10,000 times from SourceForge and fewer than 10,000 times from the Google Play store. That particular navigation app seems to have been basically abandoned, probably because the people who worked on it have since moved on to different jobs or schools.  

Anyway, my point is that my project seems like it was pretty obscure and small. Is this normal? It seems like a lot of people write Master's theses that are more, well...meaty.",0,2016-07-05 20:23:47

I felt forced into going to university, and didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. I went to ask others who I trusted for help who were past my point in life (not peers) and whose answers would be more neutral in bias. I decided that my professors best fit that role, and so I asked for their opinion, only to find out, for the first time in my life, that no one knows what the hell they are doing. We are all just living the same P2P life, and hoping that the next time life fucks us it will be a little more gentle than last time. With that in mind, I became more anal about everything and felt the need to find out how and why things work, and how and why they do in that way. My favorite shows are where the main theme is exploration of depression. My favorite webcomics/manga are ones where human behavior is a driving force to the plot. Humans lead interesting lives, and do certain things, but why? What makes one word upbuilding and another caustic? Is laughing a response to joy and fear? Tears to happiness and sadness? How and why do these reactions inhabit opposite ends of the emotional spectrum? Shit like that. Would sociology be best? Psychology? Neither? Help?",0,2016-06-24 21:22:05
4vsqv2,wayward_wander,t2_101wr6,Is it time for me to get out of academia?,"Here's what I'd like to know:

* Should I leave academia?
* If I leave academia, what are my options? 
* Who hires people with PhD's in pure mathematics?
* What kind of additional education should I seek out? 

Some additional questions: 

* Could I, for example, get a masters in engineering in one year?
* What about transitioning to applied math or applied physics disciplines? 
* Is switching fields within mathematics (to dynamics or something else less abstract than what I'm doing now) possible? If so, how do I do that?  

The list below is long and may sound overly dramatic and hysterical in places, I know, but it will take me hours to get anything down that's not just stream of consciousness. Please ignore my emotional state if you can. I am looking for actionable career advice. 

Here's my situation: 

* Got my PhD in 2010 and have been in postdocs ever since. I have only published 2 papers. The research program I set up for myself has started to falter. I stepped back from participating in the (math) community to dedicate more time to it, but haven't gotten anywhere. 
* I know that I procrastinate/don't work/am afraid to work because I'm afraid that the more I work, the faster all of my research will break down. Knowing this hasn't made it any easier to not do it.
* I rarely write to people (my old advisor, other professors who I've collaborated with, even current coauthors) with research questions, but when I do, they never write back. 
* I have felt intrinsically incapable of contributing to society, probably since I was an undergraduate. I truly do not believe anything I think or do could have any value at all, just by virtue of it coming from me. I fundamentally can not believe that anything I think of is correct. It makes doing research in mathematics absolutely impossible. 
* If I'm being honest, I never believed I'd be able to succeed in academia, even though my goals were modest. I felt like I had to keep trying just in case thinking I couldn't do it was the only thing holding me back. My (very long term) SO is not helpful. His position is essentially that having these problems at all, and having had them for so long without being able to fix them, is reason enough to quit academia. I've never quit anything that has been meaningful to me. I don't know how to do it. 
* I have no marketable skills at all. (My degree is in pure math. I don't even know how to program.)
* A permanent lectureship at my current institution might be possible, but I'm not really interested in just teaching. I want to be able to produce things. If not academic research, then something else. I've spent a little time looking at options and found some things interesting, but I don't know how to get into them. 
* I'm sure I can learn things like programming, statistics, or data analytics, but there are so many other people doing that, I won't be competitive as a washed up mid-30's mathematician with uncontrollable depression. How am I supposed to believe I will be considered for jobs where I'll be up against 17 year olds who have been programming since they were 8? I know financial jobs like quants are open to mathematicians, but I'm pretty sure the skills they are looking for are the skills that are preventing me from staying in academia.

4uukhg,temporary_dmt,t2_zupnn,I want to go into Media Psychology field and I really need some life advice and objective evaluations,"This is my first post on Reddit. I've been reading and upvoting, but I didn't dare to speak up. Recently, I feel so lost and intimidated by the uncertainty in life that I need to write this.

WARNING: this is going to be a long post

I (25F) was born and raised in Vietnam, and I moved to Singapore by myself 10 years ago. A government agency gave me a full scholarship to study in a high school that heavily focused on math and science. Unlike other secondary schools’ and Junior Colleges’ standard program (O and A levels), my school invented its own diploma for an integrated six-year program that required students to take four out of five majors (math, physics, chemistry, biology and one of the humanities). 

Vietnam education is mainly theoretical and science-focused. We pay minimal attention to the arts, music, and physical education. We can produce thousands of mathematicians who do calculus with their eyes closed, but not many can bring that knowledge into practice. I was not an exception, I had quite an in-depth training on pure physics.

Since my Singapore high school allowed one humanities major, I was so glad I chose fine arts because that is the only reason why I’m not in a lab right now. 

After four years of science with a one-year research project in wafer fabrication, I knew I wouldn’t want to follow this path. I wanted to do architecture in university because I believed it was the fusion of art and science. I applied to architecture schools in the US, UK and in Singapore (NUS), but life took a turn and I went into digital filmmaking instead.

So there I was, drowning in a pool full of filmmakers with my one and only drawing portfolio. FYI, my high school forced its students to take AP exams. Anything below 5 is a shame. There was one person in my cohort who had 4 for Calculus BC and everyone was trying to find out who he/she was. They couldn’t stop talking about it. (I had 3 for my Art portfolio. No one knew this except my art teacher).

I knew I wasn’t a technical person, so I paid more attention to film studies, visual psychology analysis, and storytelling. I didn’t think much about what job I could get after graduation. Perhaps, deep down I knew I couldn’t get any job with this major so I unconsciously tried to push the anxiety and responsibilities to my future self (damn it, past self!). All I did was to learn and to survive.

To sum up my undergraduate education, I wrote and directed a few shorts, produced a documentary, and wrote a feature screenplay. I graduated with BFA in digital filmmaking with first-class honor. 

At that point, I also knew that I didn’t want to be in film production for the rest of my life. Even though the process of making films is fascinating and exciting, it’s also exhausting and expensive. The moment I graduated, the scholarship allowance stopped and I had to start earning almost immediately. That was last June. 

Life took another turn and I landed a job in a big tech company where I gave support to social media advertisers. The first few months were great, I learned so much about an industry I have never imagined myself to be in. However, after the honeymoon period, everything slowly became stagnant. The company culture is toxic and the job is degrading (later I learned from other friends that their corporates worked the same way). I applied to be transferred to another team but I didn’t make it. I stopped learning at my job for 9 months now and I felt that I was wasting my time every day. I never felt so insignificant and worthless in my entire life. All I wanted was to learn and to do something meaningful with my life.

I’m honored to be friends with many smart and highly achievers on Facebook. My work requires me to be on Facebook for 10 hours every day, it has become my habit to scroll the newsfeed until there are no more new posts. Every time my friend share their amazing work and academic achievements, I feel like a loser. 

To cope with my depression, I read psychology books and news. I wanted to know how the mind works and why some people want to commit suicide. I’m quite good at reading people (I think), and I feel a great resonance with psychology theories. I started to think of a possibility to go deeper into this field.

I cold-emailed a professor in my university whose research I found interesting and relevant to what I wanted to do. We exchanged a few emails, but he didn’t need a research assistant at the moment so he stopped replying. Apart from that, I think my research portfolio isn’t strong enough. Since I majored in filmmaking and I had to learn everything from scratch, I spent most of my time doing film-related stuff. I didn’t do any primary research in social sciences and only did some secondary research in art history and Singapore film studies. I know I must do something to improve the situation but I just don’t know what exactly.

I have quit my toxic job to concentrate on graduate admission (last day 31st July). I can sustain myself for up to one year. The admission period for grad school in Singapore opens around January, which means I have 4-5 months to prepare for it. I need a scholarship to continue studying because my parents couldn’t help and my saving isn’t enough. For the first time in my life, I took a leap of faith and I’m freaking out big time. 

If I can’t get into the grad school, I will be back to applying for corporate jobs. I know how it will go and the thought alone terrifies me. 

What chance do I have to be accepted to an MA (psychology) program with a BFA (Filmmaking)? How do you prepare for your graduate studies and what were your challenges? How did you overcome them? What do you think I should do now to increase my chance of getting back to school? I want to get a Ph.D. and work in academia. 

Any advice and suggestions will be greatly appreciated, thank you so much for reading.

TL;DR: I (25F) live in Singapore. I graduated with a BFA in Filmmaking and had a good grade. I’m miserable in a corporate job which I have quit after one year. I want to pursue a master and eventually Ph.D. in media psychology. What is my chance and what should I do to improve it?

4tbq1z,bernerami,t2_ovobk,Advice on writing a reference letter for a mediocre student?,"I supervised her Master's dissertation (the quality of which was only so-so), and she's asked me to write a reference letter for her application to a teacher training school. I agreed because I'm her only real option; she hasn't interacted much with other members of staff over the last year. She's plenty smart and her grades are not terrible, and I do believe her interest in education is sincere, but she also has social anxiety issues and occasional bouts with depression that have interfered with her academics. It's difficult to imagine her interacting with a classroom of students every day.

I'm not convinced that she's suited for teaching as a profession, and I feel a letter that speaks only to her positive attributes would be misleading. At the same time, I don't know her well enough to say that she couldn't rise to the challenge, and I don't want to be responsible for denying her at least the opportunity to give it a try. I'm not sure what other career options she has. I would appreciate any thoughts or advice on this dilemma, any suggestions for writing a letter that doesn't paint her in an unrealistic light, but also won't immediately torpedo her chances at being accepted.",32,2016-07-17 21:42:46

A bit about me. I'm starting the third year of my PhD. I've struggled most of my life with depression and anxiety. Both are currently being ""managed"" but with variable success, in fact my depression has been almost debilitating recently. I also am now dealing with some physical ailments (one of which was definitely caused by stress).

I've been placed on medical leave of absence from my PhD studies. My symptoms were total burn-out and severe depression (now responding well to meds). Without giving out too much info, the reason for my depression was that a massive, and I mean massive, scientific misconduct investigation went on in my institution = the working environment was a complete pile of shit. I was just lucky not to have my name on any involved articles, but my research group has basically fallen apart and I have no possibilities of going back.

But - since I had a contract and funding for four years, and the university has concluded that I do not have any fault in what went down, they are offering to give me a new project in another lab. I don't know really what to do with this. 

A part of me has just really lost confidence in research as a whole. Why should I keep working my ass off when people above and around me fake data? How can I ever keep to my high ethical standards in an environment where money and connections seem to be more important than solid, robust results that actually help people?

By january, I need to tell my university how I choose. Do I stay (in research?) or do I go (to an uncertain future, although I have my MD so no risk of not getting a job).

The death of a very close loved one, flare-up of depression and anxiety (something I'm usually able to manage) and an overwhelming amount of self-doubt about my capacity and, thus, my plans.

I have yet to take the GRE but am essentially having to re-teach all basic math to myself so it is taking longer than I would like... and I just found out the project that I plan on applying with (and was hoping to do) is essentially the exact same project that a grad student in my current department is already doing (funnily enough, I've never even spoken to this individual beyond a few friendly greetings because I am friends with a PhD student in his cohort) - so now I'm not sure if it is even ethical for me to submit such a proposal in my SOP.

Ill just say this past semester a lot happened in my life and I suffered from depression which prevented me from focusing fully on my course work. Instead of dropping out of my more difficult classes I decided to stick with them. As a result, I will most likely end the semester with a C in organic chemistry 1 and a possible C or lower grade in physics.

602otc,CompuNeuro,t2_xfv44,Including less-relevant experiences: undergrad CV?,"Hello!

So I am an undergraduate science student looking at about 1 year left in my degree program. As such, I think it's about time I start to have a really good understanding of what should (and shouldn't) go on there. 

For more background, I am currently studying Neuroscience and Computational and Data Sciences (double-majors) at my home institution, and my future course of action includes first applying to be an NIH PostBac IRTA fellow, then applying to MD-PhD programs, and finally to ending up being a Professor at an academic medical center, specifically focusing on Computational Neuroscience, focusing on translating the field to develop treatments or elucidate mechanisms of depression and other psychiatric illnesses. 

Here are my questions: *(WALL OF TEXT: hopefully the bold helps?)*

- **should I put ""unrelated work"" (in a vastly different field than my own) I've done on my CV?** as a freshman, I was required to complete a research project in the humanities (as I had very little exposure to the level of science required for science research at the time), and as such, I completed a 17pg research paper (and stood by a poster I made at our mandatory poster session) on mathematical fictionalism and its potential implications for the sciences. if I am planning on pursuing nothing related to the philosophy of math in the future fields described above, should I omit this paper and presentation from my CV? or should I keep it until I graduate from college since it's experience? am I allowed to remove it, or must my CV remain a comprehensive list of my works (i.e., would it seem dishonest to remove it)? 

- **should I put work that I am not proud of on my CV?** this is extremely embarrassing to admit, but like many individuals coming right out of high school, my maturity level was not where it is now. I spent most of freshman year ruining my sleeping habits, and procrastinating on my work until the last minutes it was due. as such, I definitely did not put in my best efforts on this paper. I would say the paper is still decent, but if I had the chance to do it over again with an attitude change, I know the potential finished product is leaps and bounds over what I turned in. can/should I omit this from my CV? questions above re: keeping it until I graduate and whether or not it is dishonest to remove are pertinent here. (I actually also did 2 high school research projects, both of which involved me picking things way over my head, so they sound impressive, but we're massive failures-- this question is also pertinent for those!) 

- **what about work that I did, but failed at?** spent a whole semester doing work, resulted in a poster presentation. afterwards, did a meta-analysis (very liberal use of this term) of the data, and showed how variable our data was. went back, and did some more tests; lo and behold, our assay kits were bad... does this still go on my CV? 

- **should I put projects I have done that are part of classes here?** as an undergraduate, I have (recently) run into research-based courses where my teacher is either asking us to design a study and carry it out through the course, or the teacher teaches both grads and undergrads. For example, I'm taking a behavioral neuroscience course where i am in a group with 3 other undergrads and we design a mouse study (wild-type C57BL/6J, no drugs, etc.--very conservative IACUC Application for the class) and carry it out, and write a final paper at the end of the class. we are actually submitting our abstract for the inclusion of our project in an end of the year symposium for our college. In a different example, I submitted a project with a very basic attempt to consolidate 2 different designations for health care shortage used in the US to my data visualization class (ordinarily taught for grads and undergrads, but only undergrads were in the course during my semester)-- I plan on continuing work on this project with the course professor, and hope to present it at a conference when it's finished. So for both/either of these cases: on the CV? on the CV only if presented at a conference/symposium? 

- **how should I list summer programs?** I have attended one summer undergrad research program (SURP), where I worked on a project, and was required to write up a final report/paper as well as deliver a 15min slide talk to the program directors, PIs, and other guests. Should I list this as an award (accepted into this program-- from what I understand, SURPs are NIH grants for their host institutions, so would I be incorrect in saying being accepted into the program is an award?)? can I list it as both the paper and the talk? I also plan on attending another SURP this Summer, so advice here is definitely appreciated!

- **can I list it as a paper if it's not published in a journal or conference proceedings?** e.g., my papers described all above!

- **how much leeway do I have for unofficial things on my CV as an undergrad?** e.g., my papers above, since they are not published in journal or presented at a conference...

- **do I remove my undergrad stuff when I get to grad school?** what about if I'm at the NIH as an IRTA PostBac fellow? 

As mentioned earlier, I am a science student, so any and all advice from anyone in the field would be super awesome!! 

Thank you so much, everyone! 

**tl;dr**: lost [science] boy has some questions about what can/can't/should/shouldn't go on his CV. questions re: **unrelated work, bad work, failed work, old work, class work, SURP [work], not really ""published"" work, and time [of work]**",7,2017-03-18 05:45:04
5zcizz,lune3141,t2_166k7v,What can an advisor do to help grad student with mental illness? (e.g. depression),"I have a very talented student who has admitted to bring mentally unwell. The person is also getting medical help already. The lab itself has very helpful and supportive members in my belief. As a very recent PhD student, I am well aware of the reasons that can exacerbate or cause a graduate student to become unwell. But encountering this issue as from a advisor's stand point is completely new to me. I am unsure how I can help the student.  
1&gt; Has any one's advisor done anything that they though was very useful?
2&gt; Is any of the academic activity such as doing mundane tasks, reviewing literature, attending seminars etc that any one thinks is useful. 
3&gt; The student is suspecting that the current topic is not interesting and is the one of the causes of the problem. Can anyone share a positive or negative experience of switching labs midway through the program. Did it help you with getting more motivated to work on research and with mental illness?

I am curious and would like to learn to help my students better.

TL;DR: Would it be better to have more industry experience in one place in an environment that does not translate well to research, or would it be better to take a chance in finding something more appropriate, or to find some part time work and do a lot of background reading around a particular topic?

#-------

I'm in a bit of a conundrum at the moment and could do with some speedy advice.  (This has turned into quite the ramble, and for that I apologise.)

Six months ago I started working as a temp in a GMP Microbiology CRO where things are tested as specified by the x/y/z pharmacopoeia.  I'm only a lab tech so most of what I do is counting microbial growth, lab housekeeping, and a few basic types of test. GCSE/A level stuff, really. Recently I interviewed for a permanent position, and it's reasonable to assume I'll be offered the job (only one other interviewee, no micro experience) and will be told over some time this coming week.  If I do get the permanent position I'll eventually be trained to do more complicated testing.  But even with more responsibility and better utilisation of my skills, the job on offer is not part of a career path that interests me long-term. If I don't get it then crisis over and this post is almost entirely moot! Hooray!

-

Before my current job I've had two short stints at a hospital in admin roles, and a 6mo FTC as a techician at an agrochem residue analysis CRO.  The technician job was pretty sweet, but I was foolish and would talk about pharma this, medicine that, and occasionally interesting masters courses I'd come across, so they were worried I wouldn't've stuck around long and didn't offer me a new contract.

The jobs I worked at the hospital were the only ones that I actually got real pleasure out of, despite only doing admin stuff.  I could test 10,000 samples tomorrow and have every one come back in spec and it wouldn't come close to how good it felt when I'd get to put a negative HIV result on the system for an infant whose blood I'd sent off for testing a few days before, or putting a 'No HCV RNA detected' result in, and flicking through previous results and seeing them decrease from tens of millions to undetectable.  Despite me just being the person who sent the samples off and put the results on the system and completely detached from the patient's clinical care, I still felt like I was helping in the betterment of someone's life and I'd be buzzing for the rest of the day.  

I graduated in 2015 (Pharma Science BSc [a jack of all trades, master of none type degree], Hons, 2.2), hoping to not have a career in analytical testing.  That I'd describe the analytical jobs I've had as 'tolerable', and that hospital admin roles were infinitely more gratifying reaffirms that hope, which is a shame because a large amount of underling jobs seem to be analytical.

-

So to cut to the chase, what I think I want to do is go back to uni to do a biological/life sciences masters, preferably research based. I didn't do well at school (repeated a year of sixth form, and still had do a foundation year) and only got a lower 2nd class Hons degree from a mediocre uni.  This can partly be put down to me struggling with depression/anxiety for as long as I can remember, and only in hindsight realising how much it had hamstrung me. But I can't go back and try again now I feel better (and not to be a Dunning–Kruger fool but a 2.1 was on the cards, and possibly a first).  I'm not dead set on a particular field/topic, but the most appealing courses specify an upper 2nd, or lower 2nd + relevant work experience. 

My concern is my current job doesn't offer me much in terms of transferable skills (pipetting, weighing, aseptic technique; not a lot more and I'm pretty proficient at them), especially with regards to research (try anything novel and quality wheels in the gallows), which in conjunction with my poor academic record would see me being rejected from these courses.

-

Part of me says drop the job now, look for something more relevant and in the mean time pick up other skills (eg bioinformatics is one path that interests me, so if I could learn python/java then that might make up for only having a 2.2), especially if I can get accredited/certification. I can also learn to drive and broaden the jobs available to me.

Another part says don't be a fucking lunatic and decline a job because I *might* find something better and wait until 2018 to apply. 18 more months in industry + possible promotions (almost certain to senior lab tech, maybe to Scientist with a little luck) will hurt me less than gaps on my CV and a lack of commitment/direction. 

A small part says if helping patients was what gave me pleasure, then drop the job *and* the idea of a masters and get another admin job in a local hospital, then work my way up.  The worst part about those jobs was the mismanagement and disdain for patients from some of the people I worked with. If I could take the reins, ditch the shitpiles and hire people that cared then.. I'm nearly climaxing at the thought.

-

I'm not sure which parts are my brain/heart/gut.  I keep flip flopping between what to do.  Do I take a job I don't want in the hopes that it counts enough for me to get where I want, or do I not and try to try and find something more appropriate?  I commute 90 minutes each way (30 min walk, 30 min train, 30 min bus) and I'm only out the lab for lunch so it's difficult to find time to talk to recruiters about other jobs.  All my jobs have taken at least that much travelling and it's starting to take its toll.  I've been reluctant to move as my jobs haven't been permanent and I live with my parents who ask for a nominal amount of rent, but a friend who lives near where I currently work has a cheap room freeing up in a few months, so the travelling could end and I'd then have the time/energy to learn to drive/pick up coding etc while working. 

-

The obvious answer is to contact whoever's in charge of admissions for a particular course for their advice, which I have for a few courses, but I've not heard anything back yet, so now I'm here.

I asked for a grade change to incomplete because the school already knew I had severe depression after I took 1.5 years off for it and got an underload, but they decided a chronically mentally ill person wasn't (understandably) worth their time so they let me graduate with my current dogshit transcript.

Even though all hope of Ivy League prestige and status and a financially comfortable 20s is behind me, I still want to go for a master's and possibly a PhD and switch to economics as my field. I'm considering a second bachelor's in Germany because its free and I speak the language fluently, or I might try for a Master's in my home country (USA). Or should I just try for the job market?

33ho2l,rebbieh,t2_70jbj,How do I get motivated again?,"Hello,

I'm in my 4th semester at university where I study biomedicine. I'm *very* interested in science and medicine and there's nothing else I'd rather study (well, sometimes I think I would've liked going to medical school to become a doctor but that's not going to happen) but things have gotten really bad lately. I've lost *all* motivation even though I really like what I study and my grades have gotten worse (simply because I've lost motivation). Last year they were pretty great and now they're average at best. I am yet to fail an exam but the grades I get on exams etc. are lower than they were before, which makes me very disappointed in myself.

I suspect the reason I no longer have the will to do anything comes down to two things:

1. *The fact that I no longer have a specific goal to work towards*. I used to be really sure about what I wanted to do. I used to know exactly what I wanted to study when I'm done with the bachelor's degree and I knew I eventually wanted to go into medical research. I still think that's what I want but I'm not sure in what area and if it's even possible for me to work with the things that really interest me. I've been trying to ask professors and other people about it but no one really has any good answers to my questions.

2. *Psychiatric/neuropsychiatric problems*. I have Asperger's syndrome, which makes certain things really problematic for me. Especially things like oral presentations, stress (I have pretty much zero stress tolerance), perfectionism, anxiety, depression etc. I'm trying to work on it (autism isn't something that'll go away but I'm trying to come up with good coping strategies etc.) but it's difficult. I'm a very stubborn and determined person who loves learning things so I don't really give up but it's difficult for me to adapt to higher levels of pressure/stress, which means things are more difficult now than last year. I know it's hard for others too but most people still seem to have some kind of innate ability to adapt that I don't really possess.

I think the most important thing for me and my academic future is to find the motivation again. It would also be really helpful to figure out what I want to do with my life but that's a huge question and I don't really know where to start.

Most people don't have autism/Asperger's *but* I know it's very common for students to lose motivation at times, which means some/most of you probably have too at some point. So, I'm wondering if any of you have any advice on what to do...? How do I get motivated again? How'd you do it? Also, how do I figure out what I want to do in the future? So far there are basically two areas I'm interested in (the area between neuroscience and psychology, and medical microbiology) but I don't even know what one can do in those areas.

Anyway, thanks for reading.

36sanl,johnbyom,t2_nlv68,Exam Deferral due to Anxiety/Depression,"I have requested an exam deferral due to issues with anxiety and depression. I asked to defer the exam to a later point. I am in no way ready to sit the exam, which is tomorrow, but am worried that my request will be rejected since depression/anxiety are sometimes seen as chronic conditions that rather than requiring a deferral, are treated as a disability (so they then might give you more time to sit it etc.).

My condition started a few months ago but I am quite bad at the moment and don't feel like I can sit the exam tomorrow at all. I handed in the request with a letter from my therapist that outlines everything in more detail. Having read it again now a few times, I feel that it might sound too 'light'. I am also freaking out because anxiety might be treated as a disability. The exam is tomorrow and I have not heard back yet from the board whether the deferral got approved or rejected.

What do you advise me to do tomorrow? I don't feel like I can sit it. Go to the GP? Go to the therapist tomorrow again?

I am totally freaking out, I am shaking and sweating about this and am getting so nervous. I would really like to get some advice",1,2015-05-21 18:47:03
36oyf7,ArgentIV,t2_gebss,How feasible is pursuing a post graduate degree when one has depression?,"I should preface this by saying that I am not looking for sympathy, and am grateful for any answers you guys provide.
My situation is rather complicated so I'll do my best to be as succinct as possible:

* I'm about to finish my undergraduate degree and wish to pursue my studies in the UK, specifically in Oxford or Cambridge (I do have other universities in mind namely Durham, Edinburgh and Aberystwyth, but the two big names are the main ones. Also I'll have no familial support if I apply anywhere else).
* I meet enough of the requirements and expectations to justify my application to names above. 
* Insofar as one can be aware of just how high one's aspirations are, I am aware of how high my aspirations are.

However:

I have depression due partly to the fact that I have been brought up in an environment where everything I work on in an academic setting (which I have only recently stopped associating with bullying and blind teachers), no matter how trivial, has been framed as the single exercise/essay/exam on which my entire life hangs, with little to no support of any kind and near-constant antagonism from my dominant parent literally for as long as I can remember. There are other factors as well, but they are less immediately relevant to my query. 

The stresses brought on by this mind-set have resulted in me being sick of nearly any form of work I have to undertake. It is still present, though lessened somewhat in my chosen field of study, but comes at me in full force outside of it (mainly because I have to work harder to accomplish the set tasks).

Assuming I get in, I have about nine months between graduating and beginning my Master's. Priority will be to try and get the help which has up until now been denied me, but there is no guarantee I will be able to for an adequate amount of time. 

To those of you with depression who have gone to/are in similarly intensive programmes: How accommodating were they? Were you able to cope and do well?

Right now I am less concerned with whether or not I have a chance of getting in and a lot more worried about how things will be if I do.

It’s very late where I am, so I’m going to leave this up and check it and respond to any comments when I get up.

Thank you in advance for any and all replies. ",5,2015-05-20 23:50:34
34kmgk,[deleted],,Still possible to be an exchange student?,"Struggling with depression, I failed this academic year's first semester and had to retake the examinations I failed. Thankfully, I did well the second time.  Sadly, the fact that I failed the first time will still be shown on my report

The thing is I had planned to do a one year exchange to a foreign university. I consider this exchange important to my academic future since I could there take subjects that are not available in my home country (If it is relevant, I am an Asian civilisation student and consider a Ph. D. in history of Korean philosophy, which is not taught in my country). To strenghten my application I took the TOPIK to attest of my proficiency in Korean, and also the IELTS. I did well to both tests. So, do you think that I could still be sent as an exchange student even though I failed one semester?

Dropped out and went back many times. I have a few courses on my record where I basically never went to class or submitted anything, and ended up with stupid low grades like 32%. I don't remember exactly what my GPA is, but it's around 2.0 or less. This is at a pretty good university in Ontario, Canada, by the way, and it's only a 3-year BA, which I decided to settle for once my problems got really bad. 

Anyway, practically all my friends have done or are doing a Master's, and I honestly don't know if academia is a good or even a possible path for me, given my rough history--but I have felt that it's my true calling for many years, if I could just get my personal issues sorted. (Still working on that.) 

I'm hoping to avoid retaking the low-grade courses since they're so expensive nowadays--around $700 each now, for admission alone. That's not counting the cost of transportation, lost working hours, etc. Searching other submissions on here about low GPAs has taught me that it's apparently possible to take Graduate-level courses without being enrolled in the program, which is something I'd rather invest money in to find out for myself/prove that I can succeed at that level. Being able to enroll in an MA program would still be a ways off for me no matter what, because I still have to learn to cope with my mental handicaps, but if there's even a small chance, I'd like to start working on the steps since I'm getting into my upper 20s now.

Anyway, I know the only real way to get the answer to my question about striking the old grades from my record is to ask my school, but I thought I'd seek some feedback from you guys nonetheless. Maybe someone has advice for my particular situation. If not, no worries; thanks anyway for reading.",0,2015-04-30 04:14:15

I dropped out of school last semester, to take some time off to work and clear my head. I've been suffering from major depression and anxiety problems, and I think it's best I stop school for a while. 

But in the past few months, my mind has cleared a bit. Enough to realize I don't want to finish my degree (3 years of school, 2 of them dedicated to a CS degree). It's just too strenuous on me. 

With some encouragement from my therapist, and parents, they've suggest I look into paralegal, or teaching, or therapy work.

Paralegal because: I have a high moral/ethical code I live by, and love to research things. I also like to play ""devil's advocate"", and don't believe anyone is really *bad* or *evil*, just misunderstood and in need of help.

Teaching because: Although I'm kind of scared of kids, I've been told I'm really good at helping them have fun learning stuff, am good at interacting with them, and both teaching and paralegal sound nice, because I'm helping make a difference in the world, even if it's just a small contribution. 

Therapy because: Well, my therapist recommended this one for me, and I've never really considered it, because I know how flooded the psych major pool is nowadays (although I think you need a masters to be a therapist?). She knows I live/love to help people, and my mental dilemmas could help me relate to clients better.

I'm a twenty-one year old girl person living India. I'm a junior at college (third year),  majoring in electronics engineering. 

Now, my problem is that I absolutely hate my major. When I chose it, I thought I could handle it and in retrospect I was a pretty naïve 19 year old. Also, parental pressure.  :/
I have always been a bright student (ranked at #6 out of 60 students in my major when I started uni) and I consider myself fairly intelligent.  But the last three years have been nightmarishly terrible.  My grades have been constantly slipping, I've been flunking subjects left and right and I can't bring myself to study at all. And to top it all, I've been suffering from depression for the past five years.  

Also, in India, you can't change your major once you've chosen it. :'c

The thing that has me most worried is what am I supposed to do once I graduate? I have a strong interest in literature and languages (fluent in English and Hindi, intermediate in Spanish and Sanskrit, and a beginner in Esperanto and German)  and I'm good at mathematics so I wanted to do something in one of those fields.  *And, I want to get out of this country as soon as possible.* I don't know, I feel like I don't fit in at all. 

That's why I'm asking for your help. Could you guide me, please? I'm imagining I'll sit for GRE and go for my Master's in one of those fields but I'm absolutely clueless about the pros and cons, job prospects outside India and so on. I know liberal arts is not so money fetching and  I'm not running after the $$$, but I'd like to lead a comfortable life and be able to support myself. And just be happy.

In 2014 I graduated from high school and went on the hunt for colleges for my future. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, so I chose my University based on potential scholarships alone. I chose Wittenberg University as the college of my future, it had a beautiful campus and a swim team that I really wanted to join, so I applied and was accepted. My church had a full tuition scholarship for this university, but I was unable to use it for the first year due to another student using the scholarship for his senior year. My parents ended up having to drain everything I had and take out an eight thousand dollar loan to cover the cost for two semesters. I ended up getting pretty severe depression in the middle of my second semester and had to withdraw from the university. I spent the summer at a low paying job as a lifeguard and didn't manage to raise enough to pay back my parents.

I decided to go back to college locally at NKU in the fall of 2015. I didn't receive any scholarships and FASFA didn't grant me anything due to my fathers income, regardless of the fact that I have five siblings and one in college all on this one income. I have to use my money from the summer to pay for parking, books and what loans wouldn't cover for my tuition. Money is tight and living at home is making me depressed again and I need to get out, but I cannot afford to be on my own.

I have no idea what I wan to do for a living and this is my second attempt at college. I have wasted so much of my parents and my own time and money on an education that I am getting nothing out of. I don't want to continue to just show up for class, make mediocre grades in classes that I am not interested in, all to chase a goal that I don't even know what it is. Everything seems like a pointless money pit that makes me realize that I have no idea who I am or what I want to be.

I dont know what the real world is like and I sure as hell am not prepared, but living this life of debts and confusion doesn't seem like a way to live life. 

Am I doing something wrong? Is there any point to continue to waste my time somewhere I cannot seem to appreciate enough to find what interests me? Is quitting college and working in a factory until I can get out of debt and save up money a reasonable idea? What should I do Reddit? I am so very lost.

Unfortunately... about a week ago I found out that I got dropped from spring classes because my university didn't have my final transcripts. Upon trying to reorder them from my undergrad, I learned that I owed $1,600 to my undergrad and that they won't mail them out until the account is settled. 

I'm a first generation college student from a low SES background so my family can't help me. I make shit money at my assistantship so I can't afford to pay it off before classes start next Monday.  


In order for me to keep my assistantship, I have to be enrolled in classes. I am terrified to talk to my family, my academic advisor, my students, and my boss. 

I've worked so hard to be here. My entire life has been based on the fact that I wouldn't be another statistic stuck in the poverty cycle. I grew up being told I was smart and talented enough to actually achieve the American dream and up until now, it's been true. Yet, in less than a week, my entire life might go to shit. I've never felt such a large sense of failure, shame, and depression. 

I've been in hardcore denial so I'm using this as a platform to finally admit it, but is there anyway that this will turn out alright? Or anything I can do? 

**TL;DR:** After working hard my entire life, my low SES will be the reason I get kicked out of grad school :(

4bbhvd,LeviPerson,t2_f6dhk,I feel utterly lost and powerless. Do I have an academic future? Warning: Long.,"If this would be more appropriate elsewhere, feel free to redirect me.

Where to begin . . . 

I attended college for two years as a Philosophy and English dual major starting in Fall of 2010 in Tennessee. During that time, due to various familial difficulties; depression, social anxiety, and my inability to realize I suffered from them; and my issues with the university (maybe higher education itself, but I've only attended one school and it seems unfair to judge) I went from fully paid tuition, to my grades dropping drastically resulting in academic probation and eventually dropping out of school having lost nearly all of my intellectual curiosity and gaining debt. 

The only two things I have ever wanted to do with my life are writing and teaching, and they're what I'm good at. Before entering college, I was reading a book a week. By the middle of my first semester, I was already considering dropping out. By the end of my second year, I stopped reading and writing almost completely. I would go to school (skipping some classes), do none of the work, go home, and do practically nothing (even neglecting things I would normally do to unwind, like playing video games) just to de-stress from the events of the day, sleep restlessly, and do it all over again the next day. 

I have never liked school, but have always loved my teachers. I was closest to two of my professors -- both of whom could tell how unhappy I was; told me I wasn't stupid, crazy, or lazy; believed in me; liked my writing and encouraged me to do whatever I had to to continue doing it; shared my criticisms of the University; and gave me the same piece of advice: ""I have no idea how to advise you."" Dropping out seemed like the best idea, despite it just being the less undesirable choice. So I did. 

Today I have more control over my social anxiety than I have ever had, and sometimes feel depressed because I'm *not* in school. My girlfriend, who I can easily see myself with indefinitely, is a law student at an excellent school and has no problem whatsoever with the fact I didn't graduate -- nor does she mind being the primary breadwinner (to the point that she would be okay with me quitting my job later to focus full-time on my writing. I'm a lucky guy.) I had already dropped out when we met, was up front about my academic history and the likelihood I would return -- all of it. She believes in and is fully supportive of me. However, I have some anxiety that one day she will wake up no longer happy, and the thought that I will eventually realize she is only with me to keep me off the streets breaks my heart. I edit my girlfriend's papers, and it's made me miss writing them. We sometimes talk about me going back to school. I am always the one to initiate this conversation and feel no amount of pressure from her. I believe she genuinely will fully support either decision. 

Right now I work full time as a security guard. The pay is shit, but I am free to read and write as I please. I have been working on a novel for about eight years and am happy with where it's going, but these things take time and it is going to take more. I also know I will learn things in college that I would never learn outside of it, and those things are likely to help my writing.

I was miserable in college. I'm miserable out of it. I want to believe that my college experience was terrible because of the school went to. I want to believe there is a school where I will be happy. In five months I will be 25. The longer I wait to return to University, the more difficult it will be and the more disconnected from the other students I will feel. I attended a large, easy-to-get-into University. Should I return, I would like to attend a small Liberal Arts school. One professor wanted me to go to Stanford (his alma mater) and was willing to write me a Letter of Recommendation, but we both knew I would never get in no matter what he said. That brings me to the crux of my problem.

I don't know if I should go back, where I would go, how I would get in, how I would pay for it, whether I'd just be miserable again and come out with nothing but more debt to show for it, or who to talk to for help. A few hours ago I asked for information from Sewanee's Philosophy department and sent an email to someone involved with transfer applicants, but the University is closed until next month and I don't know if they'll even entertain the possibility of accepting me. I feel like I'm grabbing at air. I feel completely lost and have no direction whatsoever. My entire family is uneducated and poor, so they can't help me at all. I've felt this way for too long. I'm emotionally fatigued. I need help.

The (peer-reviewed article) seems to imply that North Korean defectors with experience of repatriation and/or family members in North Korea have a higher perceived stigma for depression (14).
However, at the same time it implies this is the case for defectors with North Korean family in South Korea (12). This is also what the data in their table 3 backs up and is included in the summary.

I see no data or argument to support the first case.

I'm 28 turning 29 right now but i Graduated with a BA in Biology from SUNY Binghamton in 2009. My GPA is low really low like 2.7. But I always wanted to be a medical doctor so I know with my current grades it isn't possible at all right now. During this whole time I've had undiagnosed Major depression (still have depression but I have professional help), I started out my first year with a 3.6 GPA and its gone down every single year as things got worse for me. Now that I've been stable and feel much better, I want to go back on track. But I'm not sure what to do. I can't get into any post bac programs or any grad programs with what I have. All the general prerequisites that most schools require I have finished and got at least B's in. But I'm not sure what my course is now. I can't go back to the environment of Binghamton anymore but I'm willing to move around. 

I know its really unrealistic of me to want to work my way to Medical School slowly, but it is what I really want to do in my life. Any advice on what I can do? Thank You REDDIT

45uqjx,fmacademicl,t2_v04yx,dealing with post-phd depression/uncertainty?,"Throwaway, obvs. I curse a lot, sorry.

Currently PhD 5. I submitted my dissertation last week. I defend in April; I graduate in June. It's as good as a done deal. I completed exactly on schedule. I did all the shit exactly as it's supposed to be done. I have academic accolades aplenty, a publication, a bunch of teaching experience, enthusiastic references, money in the bank, etc etc. 

Submitting the dissertation felt like nothing. There was no jubilation. I can't seem to allow myself to celebrate this as an achievement in any way.

I chose not to go on the academic job market, because I'm tired. I've been in university without a significant break since 2005 and I'm just fucking exhausted. I am completely disillusioned with my discipline, and just not interested in it the way I once was. I regret doing my PhD in what I did it in (a crusty humanities field). I'm a young ""rad"" queer theory type in an old white dude discipline that by and large thinks queer theory is a load of narcissistic bullshit, or so comfortably marginal they don't have to deal with ""that kind of thing"". It used to feel edgy. Now I'm just. fucking. tired.

The biggest reason, though, is that I have no desire to move to some shitass tiny college town in Fucksville, USA. I'm not from the US, I didn't do my degree in the US, I don't particularly want to live there at all. And now having seen the jobs that came up this application season, I don't think I would have wanted any of them anyway. I realize I should have thought about this before I started. But, you know, you couldn't have persuaded me otherwise, because school was always the thing I was best at in the world, and got the most enjoyment out of. I was that little nerdy undergrad who hung out in the journal aisle of the library for fun. And it's a bit late now for regrets.

So I'm staying in the big city. I should be ecstatic probably. It's a good city. But I am crushingly, crushingly depressed. There is no solid plan B; most of the stuff that's touted as plan Bs for academic dropouts just doesn't hold any interest for me. I have no desire to launch myself on some other high-flying career path or climb the corporate ladder or start my own business or whatever. Honestly, I think I just want to get a mindless job for a while and spend some time becoming a person again, but I have no idea if a fucking PhD could even get a mindless job in the first place.

My twenties are as good as gone (I'm 28). My peers mostly figured this shit out when they left school the first time around, at all of 21. Sure I got to indulge my shit for a few years, but I didn't even *enjoy* it most of the time. The first two years were okay (or at least so busy I didn't have time to think about whether I was enjoying myself), but things precipitously dropped after that. It's no heartrending lifechanging intense pursuit of passion, just a lot of frustration, and I must have spent like three-quarters of it depressed to varying degrees, at times clinically, at times on medication, often drinking heavily. I've managed to curb the drinking for the past few months, but there's always the danger of it creeping back.

I am good at the academic shit. It makes sense to me. I know how to write the things academics like to read and appease them in the right ways. I am still completely unconvinced my dissertation has any merit whatsoever, although my committee all said I should be proud. I cut a lot of corners. I nonetheless somehow managed to fool the gatekeepers. Impostor syndrome? hell yes it is, since day one.

I don't really have hope for the future right now. I've reached the end of this tether. I don't feel like I'm really good at anything else; I sure as hell don't have people skills, and I'm not even from the country I'll be trying to get employed in.

I am working on getting the therapy I obviously desperately need (such a horrendously protracted process, fixing your head, all of it), but I was wondering whether anyone had any insight. This is an incredibly distressing time (aided and abetted by the fact I was unexpectedly dumped a couple weeks before I submitted, which I have had, and am having, an enormous struggle with). I always felt isolated, but I feel extra super isolated now, and precarious, and frankly terrified as shit. I feel like I've fucked up something wicked at some point in this process &amp; I'm not really sure how to bring any enjoyment whatsoever back into my life.

I was hoping maybe at least something about this might resonate with someone out there.",22,2016-02-15 04:11:41
3z07q7,FormlyDepressedHS,t2_tdy3g,Under performing High School Senior wondering about research experience,"It may be a bit too early for me to be considering a PhD in sociology, but I find sociology very interesting and finally a real driving passion for me to do well in life. My years in High School overall haven't been the most outstanding performance. 9th grade I got almost straight As and my life just went downhill from there. During my 10th grade year I just started losing interest in everything I liked in school which pulled my grades down to Bs and Cs. Finally my 11th grade year I had bout of crippling depression which effected my whole Junior year. My grades went from Bs and Cs to Fs and would've failed the 11th grade if it wasn't for achieving decent grades my first quarter. Over the summer I was prescribed a new antidepressant and my life has been improving ever since.

Now in my senior year I have been getting interested into Sociology by first reading The Sociological Imagination by C. Wright Mills and then Discipline and Punish by Michel Foucault. I found myself finding a passion in the field and now wonder how to get as much experience in Sociology as possible. Being a High School student are there any ways I could get research experience in Sociology? Lastly, considering my terrible grades my Junior I'll be going to Community College for 2 years, and I wonder if there will be possible ways to get Research Experience during those 2 years before I transfer (hopefully) to a 4 year state University. I live in the state of Maryland and in my luck the University of Maryland, College Park is ranked quite high in Sociology (24th as state by U.S. News and World Reports). Are there any other concerns I must consider? Thanks. ",4,2016-01-01 09:43:19
3wc4lb,hopelessthrowaway10,t2_sum3f,When are you really screwed out of grad school?,"So, I'm an undergraduate doing a double major in Computer Science and Neuroscience. Just transferred to a decent state university with a 3.85 GPA. I had always planned on pursuing the academic route, so my current situation is pretty depressing.

This semester has been incredibly horrible for me, I basically have experienced a very rough patch in my personal life (including temporary homelessness and depression), this impacted my grades severely. It's looking like I'm going to make 2 B's and at least one C, with one bordering on a D, depending on my final score tomorrow. (Calculus I, which I would think would be a horrible class to fail on a transcript) This will effectively drop my GPA close to a 3.2. I feel like I have, in one semester, ruined any chance at actually pursuing a meaningful graduate education, because I have diminished my chances at getting into a desirable program. (Was wanting to do something in computational neuroscience) I want some opinions or maybe stories of people actually coming out on top from a similar situation.

End of my undergraduate education, I could have a 3.7ish GPA, and I plan on actually getting involved in research next semester. (Had a small internship so far, but it was only five weeks and probably not worth much in the long run.) I am worried that this horrible semester will haunt me forever and ruin any chance at me being competitive.

So... Should I throw in the towel? If not, where do I start rebuilding my academic career so I can get back on track to applying for graduate school in 2 years?",5,2015-12-11 05:37:15
3w22g6,throwmeawaaaa123,t2_sp1sd,Should I avoid mentioning depression in SoP?,"Around two years ago I developed a depression and literally quit everything including school. Now I'm well, about to finish my BS, sending applications for MS programs. My GPA is *technically* not affected from the depression because I retook the failed courses. But my transcript is [horrible](http://imgur.com/S7FIkrY). By the time I'm posting applications I'll have a cumilative GPA around 3.0. 

At the time, I should have frozen my enrollment, but instead, I thought I might go to school, but then I didn't. Also I didn't see any doctors so I have no documentation of depression if that matters.

1. I'm planning to talk about why I have a shitty transcript (just transcript, not GPA) in my SoP. I'm told [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/3vjxfq/is_it_possible_to_document_depression_happened_2/) that I shouldn't provide a documentation in my application.

Instead should I just write ""health problems""? 

2. Many admission committees calculate the GPA for the applicants last 2 years of study. For me that's below 2.0 due to repeated courses if they don't go back to last 3 years of study. While calculating, do they go back or just take last 2 years? Should I add anything about this in my SoP?

3vr0g9,When-You-Sleep,t2_s9en8,Question Regarding Breach of Conduct for a Professor,"Hey AskAcademia,

Let me begin; I am currently enrolled as an undergraduate student at a top 30 public university in the United States. I began taking courses within a certain subject that only one professor was teaching in order to satisfy a prerequisite for completing my degree program. I excelled in this class, a language class, due to my familiarity with this language from a personal background in speaking it.

One evening, I ran into the professor of this course at a bar, and we drank together - both of us discussing the course and my familiarity and passion for the language, and it was brought up that I should be a teacher's assistant - a job which duties included: creating tests for the courses; grading those tests; creating assignments for the course; assisting with teaching courses as an in-class tutor; assisting the professor with promotion of the program that was taught by them; and other various tasks that would alleviate the workload ***that the professor was paid to do***. I should mention, that for a time, I graded and created tests for courses I was enrolled in - that gave me an unfair advantage over the other students, as I had created the tests and answer sheets before I myself had taken the test.

The position of TA / SI (student instructor) was as a volunteer - I was not paid by the university, and I did not undergo any formal application, induction, or screening before accepting this position - it was simply between me and this professor.

The “relationship” (although professional, I was sometimes under the impression that the older, opposite sex professor fancied something more… personal… with me) continued to grow, and times had been reached where work I was supposed to complete for the class that I did not complete was overlooked in the grading scheme. We continued to meet socially, and I learned a great deal about this professor’s side business (that she did not want me to talk about/said that the university was not supposed to know about), the professor's personal life and relationships, the professor’s depression and other medical (psychological and physical) problems - including drug treatments for her depression (the professor has shown up in the past visibly intoxicated from their prescribed anti-depressants during meeting to give me tests), and other various information bits that I have always believed to be unethical for a student to know about their educator.

I have, up until now, bit my tongue about these discretions - as the job as the TA was going to yield me a very promising letter of recommendation for graduate school, and the job allowed me an insight into tests and assignments that I used to excel in the classes unfairly (I studied the answer keys before I wrote the tests and scored perfect on several tests and assignments because of this advantage). This, I should remind you, was all allowed to me by the professor, and she knew full well the advantages I would have in having access to this information before I had taken these tests.

After TA’ing under this professor for a few semesters, the professor began telling me about online courses that they taught, and asked if I would be interested in posing as the professor (after being given the professor’s login credentials and instructions on how the assignments and tests were to be handled) to these other institutions which included a college and another highly reputable public university - if accepted I would have been paid $1,000.00 under the table. I used the professor’s credentials to log in and view the courses from the instructor’s account, however after some issues arose with the department administration at these colleges, I was simply not told whether I was supposed to continue posing as the professor to teach/grade the courses or not - I did not end up working this “position” and it was never spoken of again afterwards.

This semester, I seemingly fell out of favor with the professor, as other classes more pertinent to my double majors took precedence over the classes I took with this professor in order to continue this trend of taking courses I had an advantage in - in order to boost my GPA. I continued to punctually and efficiently serve as this professor’s Teacher’s Assistant throughout the semester I am currently enrolled in. A similar understanding of overlooking certain assignments and tests - due to my time invested in grading tests and assignments for this professor, and my obvious familiarity with the material being covered - was implied at the beginning of the semester that I would be given the same ‘perks’ I was given in the past - namely being excused from some assignments and leeway given on my grading.

The professor text messaged me a few days ago, specifically to inform me that I had a very poor grade in the class and it was my decision to complete a semester’s worth of assignments in a weekend in order to pass the class. Aside from this being totally unplanned, as in the past I did not have this brought up at the end of the semester, and the notion that she never stated that anything would be different this semester as it had been in the past, this came as quite a shock to me, as I already had a solid work schedule [at my place of employment - not as a TA], and several other finals and exams to prepare for this weekend - with the final for the class I have with this professor being tomorrow. 

***EDIT:*** I should mention that I speculate - in line with my suspicions that the professor intended to initiate inappropriate personal relations with me, and in light of me sharing with her a new relationship I am currently in - I believe this change in arrangement to be an act of sabotage out of some deep yielded jealousy over my romantic life. ***/EDIT***

So after reading that detailed background - I feel since this professor wronged me (even though preferential treatment of students is not a wrongdoing in itself - the professor still wronged a past arrangement that we had come to) - I feel obliged to try to repay this professor’s actions towards me with actions of my own - namely in potentially bringing this to the attention of the university. 

Obviously the professor has engaged in unethical conduct as an educator towards a student, and as well with other students in the courses being taught by them. But were there any specific laws that were violated, and what should I (potentially) tell the department chair *IF* I deem this worthy to be brought to their attention?",2,2015-12-07 04:25:33
25tj08,[deleted],,"When to throw in the towel, or, consequences of a very low graduate GPA.","I'm sort of at a crossroads and feel at a loss as for what to do. I just finished the first year of my economics PhD program with very bad grades (2.7 GPA) due to a variety of circumstances, including lack of preparation (compared to my classmates) and depression. The way my program works, we have prelims in June, and if we fail, we can retake in August. After two failed attempts, you are on the MA track, and you spend the next year funded as a TA. I have essentially zero chance of passing prelims (even the DGS told me so), and honestly I have little interest in passing, because I've decided I'm not interested in the PhD anymore.

The thing is, there's a 3.0 GPA requirement to receive any graduate degree. I have concerns about being able to get my GPA up, especially because this last semester, I worked my butt off and still ended up with 2 B-'s. The (sort of) good news is that we can take math upper-level undergrad courses and courses in the business school (marketing, finance, etc.) for credit next year, and everyone says that grades in the math department and b school are much higher than in the econ department (all our courses so far have been very intense, very dense theory courses taught in the econ department). 

But still, it would take me getting a B+ average from here on out to even be able to graduate, and I'm concerned that getting an MA with such a low GPA could actually *hurt* my opportunities in the job market anyway, since I could just drop out right now and write off my first year as an experiment that resulted in a realization that I didn't want to be in academia (not untrue).

I know that, as an academic subreddit, perspectives on what my situation will signal in the private sector might be limited, but I couldn't really think of anywhere else to ask this. Thanks.

TL;DR: Bad grades in graduate program, will inevitably be working toward MA instead of PhD by fall. Wondering if I should drop out now so I can tell employers I spent a year in a PhD program and changed my mind, or spend the next year trying desperately to get up to a 3.0, which, since it's not a great GPA anyway, may actually hurt me in the job market.

EDIT: Just wanted to stress something I've mentioned in comments below. Passing prelims is not nearly as ""trivial"" as it is in many other programs. Typically only 1/2 to 2/3 of cohorts end up passing after both tries, and those numbers are after you take out the few people who end up leaving the program immediately after first year and not even taking the exams or getting the masters. So those numbers are slightly inflated. I know I am the lowest, or perhaps next to lowest performing student in my cohort of ~20 right now. Also, I have no interest in passing anyway. I no longer want the PhD and would just leave the program with an MA even if I passed. ",15,2014-05-17 21:55:12
24e3t0,bks33691,t2_8jukh,Resources for homeschool unit on the Holocaust? AKA Developing a solid lesson plan and syllabus [xpost from /r/askhistorians],"I apologize if this isn't the right subreddit for this - if there's a better place to ask, let me know and I'll be happy to delete this and post it somewhere else. I posted it in /r/askhistorians and someone there suggested this might be a better choice. I'm also going to try posting it to /r/homeschooling and see if anyone has any ideas there.

I am homeschooling my 15-year old, and she has chosen to study the Holocaust as our next unit. I am choosing to start with a brief (!) overview of World War I, then move through the Weimar Republic, the Golden Age, The Great Depression, then on to the rise of the NSDAP and the Holocaust itself. My thinking was that the period before World War II is critical in understanding how things happened the way they did.

I am trying to incorporate many different subjects into these themes - for example, I would like to talk not only about political and military events, but look at art movements during these times, gender issues, rationalism, etc.

There is so much material out there that I'm finding myself struggling to identify good resources so we can do some broad learning, but still stay somewhat focused on the unit's ""theme"". So far I have identified the following resources as supplemental materials:

* Blank maps of Europe for her to fill in for various time periods
* The movie *Metropolis* (assuming I can find it)
* Discussions about *Brave New World*, which she has already read
* *Little Man, What Now?* by Hans Fallada
* German Propaganda from Calvin.edu
* The movie *Conspiracy* with Kenneth Branagh
* *Frauen: German Women Recall the Third Reich* by Alison Owings
* One or more of: *Night* by Elie Weisel, *The Drowned and the Saved* by Primo Levi, *Man's Search for Meaning* by Viktor Frankl
* The Frontline documentary *Memory of the Camps*

I feel like I'm already getting into huge overload territory - this seems like enough stuff for a year's worth of study. What recommendations do any of you that focus on this time period have for either narrowing this down more or replacing some of what I have listed with better options? Additional options? My daughter is smart, so I don't have to simplify it too much, but I do want to make sure that I'm keeping things broad enough to explore tangents if we feel compelled to do so.",4,2014-04-30 19:15:22
2471a2,justsomemammal,,"Questions about doing research outside your field for fun, and doing research on wacky-sounding things","Since having a baby I have been pretty shocked by how many topics relating to pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting are infiltrated by pseudoscience and ""anecdata."" It is often frustrating to me -- I wish I could just hop onto google scholar or pubmed and find out the ""right"" way to parent but obviously it isn't that easy.

Sometimes I run into topics that seem easy enough to study but aren't very mainstream. One example that comes to mind is placenta encapsulation -- a small minority of women have their placenta dried out and turned into little pills that they take after giving birth. Supposedly this helps stave off postpartum depression.

I think it would be easy enough to team up with some kind of midwife or doula who is offering this kind of service and do a small but well-designed study to see if there is actually any effect. It seems unlikely to me that it works, and if there is no effect it seems better to be able to point to a study showing that than to write it off as something gross and weird-sounding. Or if it does work, that seems important to know also.

But I think it would make me look like a lunatic. If, for instance, a hiring committee saw that I was studying something like this, I don't think their judgment would be positive.

What are your thoughts on this? Have you ever used your research skills to dabble outside your professional realm of expertise? How did it turn out?

23r1s7,distressed_student34,t2_g9fp7,Is the mental trauma I'm going through a normal part of the academic stress/grind? (Warning: A Bit Lengthy),"Hello all.  So, here is what I have going on and any answers would be appreciated.  

I am currently working towards my bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics.  I have been accepted on deferred admission to my first choice for graduate school and hope to attend in Fall of 2015.  My undergraduate studies are going great as far as academics are concerned.  I am currently pulling a 3.7 GPA

However, I am a little concerned for my mental state.  Last summer was the last time I was really content.  I was simply participating in some undergraduate research and taking a few summer generals (easy A's) on campus. As soon as the semester started, I became eager to take on some of the challenging and unfamiliar courses.  I was *pumped* at the beginning of the semester, my mind seemed to be a sponge for the acquisition of new physics and mathematics material.  It had always unfailingly been.

As per usual, at mid semester the the fervor began to wear out.  This isn't strange.  We lose our childlike wonder when being forced to hash through the details of a subject in some long assignment.  However, this time it never returned.  I had a difficult time finding the motivation to become unstuck from particularly difficult problems and the quality of my homework slowly declined until the end of the semester.  It came gradually.  At the beginning of the semester I was able to sit down for 3 hours at a time and enthusiastically complete all of the homework.  Then it would get the point where I would solve 4/5 problems with some measure of enthusiasm before merely writing something down for the 5th problem and declaring ""whatever, good enough"" in my mind.  Then this happened for the last *two* problems of the assignments, and eventually the last *three*.

I developed very severe hypochondria in late November and early December before Christmas break.  I thought I had brain cancer, signs of ALS and MS, skin cancer, liver cancer, and lung cancer all within a whirlwind three weeks lasting until the end of the semester.  I thought Christmas break would make things okay, but it didn't.  I was fearing illnesses all throughout break and could not think of anything else all break.  Because of this I found myself utterly unable to focus on assignments and my grades for my final assignments plummeted.  I ended my semester with a 3.2 GPA, which is quite sub-par for me.

My hypochondria dulled somewhat but is till present.  Winter break failed to cure my increasing apathy for physics and mathematics.  I complete every assignment, but I cannot focus on it.  I was going to graduate this spring, but I found the load overwhelming and had to drop a required course until the Fall semester in order to salvage grades in two other courses.  

When I dropped that class I became very ashamed of myself for not being able to do the initial coursework for the semester.  I became very depressed and started to briefly entertain suicide (thought experiments on how I could hang myself in my closet).  The combination of depression, apathy for the subjects of study, and sometimes hypochondria and loneliness have made studying and completing coursework more difficult than ever.  I have a very hard time focusing on homework and completing it with good quality.  The difficulty of my classes from this year to last has not changed insofar as class numbers are concerned.

At times I feel like an impostor and am deeply ashamed of myself.  I told my parents about my hypochondria but they would have none of it and am really afraid of their reaction if I told them I had thought of suicide.  Whenever I am doing homework my only thoughts are ""I absolutely do not want to do this"".  However, I am good at nothing else and do not want to work at a dead-end job and have regrets about not getting a graduate degree.  I am afraid that my family would be extremely embarrassed of me if I did not attend the graduate school I was accepted to.

23f5wk,Rinuv,t2_86dea,How do I begin studying Natural Sciences on my own?,"I've decided I might want to start studying Mathematics and Natural Sciences on my own for a little while.

I'm historically a terrible student. This is because of depression and anxiety, but also something else about my mind that I haven't quite been able to pinpoint, yet. Long story short, I've always been a very promising student, well-liked by teachers (usually), and I've almost never had trouble comprehending in a class.

Back in high school I wanted to study Chemistry and Physics. For various unfortunate reasons, I ended up deciding to focus on artistic pursuits with good success. After studying music and film for years in college, I've found myself having to take a break because of my anxiety and depression. 

I say all this to explain why I don't want to immediately start thinking about studying this at a university. I've had bad experiences with the academic world all my life, but I've always loved learning. Right now I don't know that I would do anything with it, but I have an interest in studying.

Do I look at university curriculums and try to follow them? Do I just go over to the library and start browsing a section?
Or maybe there's a good place to start that I hadn't thought of. That's why I'm here. Thanks!

The lack of sleep and depression from school have caused me to have a few severe health problems. 
In addition, my fiance has moved across the country and I lost a significant income source (outside of school) that helped me support myself through the degree.

None of the professors in my department specialize in what I want to focus on in my research. 
They also have not allowed me to even start doing research formally since I have not passed the qualifying exam yet (and oddly enough, almost no other domestic student has passed, so there seems to be a bias towards the foreign students which a lot of us have noticed).

I have started to look for a job since I really can't take it anymore but am starting to have second thoughts.

21uaxf,tweees,t2_fxhxj,Unsuccessful in traditional classroom. Advise?,"Hi everyone! I’m in need of academic advisement, so I was hoping someone on here can offer me some insight.

I attend a state university and have about a year left before I complete my undergraduate degree in the sciences. However, I’ve been extremely dissatisfied with my education because my learning style just isn’t compatible with the traditional classroom. I try to grind my way through at the pace of the class, but, oftentimes, I can’t keep up and end up failing classes every semester. Needless to say, my GPA is absolute shit, and I’m constantly on my university’s “warning” list. On the other hand, I excel in my lab courses and any other course where I get to work closely with the professor because I get to make my own learning timeline but still finish strong by the deadline. I know that I am capable of succeeding academically because my professors have praised my work and constantly send me off to conferences to represent our school. I genuinely love to learn and just want to do things at my own pace without worrying about being disqualified from great opportunities because I don’t have the GPA to back up what I can do. I’ve literally had breakdowns and was diagnosed for clinical depression because of my academic standing. My school’s administration isn’t helpful at all because they’ve turned me away for almost everything. For example, I got extremely sick one semester and brought in medical documentation to apply for a semester withdrawal, but they basically said “too bad” and I ended up failing every single class that semester from being out of school. I’m absolutely exhausted from being stuck on “survival mode” these past few years and was wondering if there is anything I can do to make things easier for me from now on and get a more fulfilling education. I'm also open to other options for finishing my degree. ",0,2014-03-31 17:04:38

Grandma is funding tuition and has specific requirements but I can't just quit my job.. 

I really want to go to school and earn my Bachelor's. I'm about to be 24 years old, and only 10 credits into being a sophomore technically. (Never too late to go back to school.. ) :)  

But I am becoming very frustrated, and my uncle is basically dictating everything and being a jerk about it. When I was at the community college and working full-time, I only took 9 credit hours a semester.   

My uncle says, ""Just for comparison: your grandmother was required to take a
minimum of 18 semester hrs in teacher's college,  At Xavier
university, where I started out, everyone had to take at least 21
hrs/sem.  We both took more than required.""  

Are the times a'changin?  

With work, school, therapy sessions, psychiatry appointments, commuting, studying, minimal social life, sleeping 6 hours a night - Can I make this work? I get overwhelmed by stress very easily already...   so I'm a bit.. frightened..   I really need some advice. Please! Thank you!     



**edit**: Thank you for all the comments - advice and personal experiences. I really appreciate it but here is a little more background information.  

I'm going into Uni with declared major of Bachelor in Liberal Arts, minoring in Environmental Studies. May switch to a Bachelor of Arts: Environmental Studies later...

Gma and Uncle made an exception that Gma WILL fund 15 credit hours this fall semester, BUT I have to take 17 credit hours next spring to make up for that 1 credit hour. Uh. I don't know if they understand the whole 'hours' thing. The degree plan is set up so that every semester you take 15 credit hours, besides semesters where you take a lab + lecture = 5 credit hours. And Year 4 I'll be required to take 13-16 credit hours. But basically just have to earn 120 credit hours total to graduate with a Bachelor's.   

ALSO - I am going to be checking with work to see if I can work 20-27 hours a week.. instead of 29.5 hours..    may help a little with the whole time management thing.   

Let it be noted - I do consider myself smart.. and I do have a lot of potential (that I am not currently NOT living up to.. LOL.) I am not strongly motivated/dedicated, lack commitment at times, don't really have a superb work ethic, and I'm currently seeking therapy/psychiatry sessions for bipolar type 1, depression, and GAD (not that that is an excuse..) but still. Sometimes I feel things aren't as easy for me. Stress wears me down to a point of emotional/mental breakdowns and panic attacks at times... Hmph.   

I wish I didn't have to work.. but I'm a 'grown up' -   it would all be much simpler lol but I can't afford that.. I have bills, commute to school.. so have to pay for gas, vehicle upkeep, cell phone bill, food, items to take care of myself, $40 copay for therapy (more frequent) , $40 copay for psychiatrist (every 6 weeks at the moment), etc. I should probably quit smoking cigs.. lol.. and luckily my mother is taking over my car payments and insurance ($496 off my monthly bills..)

2eh4b2,[deleted],,Switching schools/major at the eleventh hour?,"I'm attending a top-50 private school in my last semester of senior year. I was homeschooled prior to attending college (it was a crippling and devastating experience) and as such I wasn't able to adjust socially for the first two years. The school itself is also sort of a refuge for students with low functioning to midrange Aspergers syndrome, so the social situation itself is incredibly frustrating. I'm trapped without any kind of support network, knowing that I'll be spending a long time trying to recover the skills needed to acculturate myself into mainstream society, network, and gain an advantage in job interviews.

My GPA is at 2.98 as a PoliSci major, due to my general directionlessness and immaturity freshman year, poor advising, and my shock regarding the school's climate, leading to severe depression. The head of my department informed me that PolSci doesn't have the course offerings required to matriculate into most graduate programs because of poor funding, and my own experience with an internship course was underwhelming - we're paying 30K per year and most internships people do in my department are for local politics/canvassing jobs! The only exceptions are for people who can afford to go abroad. If I had known this beforehand, I never would have declared.

I'm considering a switch to a mathematics major (which I was very good at back in high school, was a Mathlete...) because, let's face it, I'll be tending bar until a second-rate graduate program accepts me if I continue on the path I'm on. The 30K I'd be paying for my last semester is worth two years of in-state tuition when you factor in financial aid, so I'm strongly considering taking a semester off to work on my personal issues and then applying to the state school + aid while I'm still enrolled at my previous school's degree program (second BA means no aid). I don't think my school is worth the egregious amount of money any longer, but I'm looking at lost time. FYI I'm turning 24 in December, and I'm 30K in the hole.

2jzkug,[deleted],,How should I approach my MFA situation?,"I want to pursue an MFA in creative writing.

I already had a terrible, misguided attempt at applying to PhD English programs that led to me getting 0 acceptance letters a few years ago. I found this incredibly demoralizing in a deeply personal, emotional way. And I have to confess, as I look at applying to grad schools now, the fear of getting slammed with another half dozen rejection letters is really holding me back. I've been out here trying to churn out resumes and cover letters in the real world for a few years, scraping by on odd jobs and poverty wages and I hate it. The only place I'm happy is on a campus and it seems like higher education is essential for continuing any sort of creative/intellectual/academic career. The publications I apply to are full of interns with published work and an Ivy league masters degree. I can't even get a full-time, unpaid internship in a city I could never afford to live in. Out here in the free market, even my grossly exaggerated resume doesn't seem substantial enough.

I had a really rough start to my undergraduate career due to poverty and depression. Unfortunately, I kept going back to school year after year, hoping my financial problems would be suddenly resolved and I'd be able to focus on school, but they never were and I kept driving my GPA down into the ground. Finally, I went on academic suspension for a year, saw a therapist and came back to school after I was old enough to qualify for Federal grants, alleviating the financial constraints that had caused my social dilemma, depression and deficient GPA. When I came back to finish my degree, I made straight As for those last two semesters and I finished my Bachelors in English Language and Literature.

So my final qualifications are as follows:
* 2.52 cumulative GPA
* 2.9 major GPA
* GRE score in the 93rd percentile verbal
* 57th percentile math (I assume a creative writing program doesn't care about math)
* Gre English Subject test 87th percentile
* My professors loved me and I have extremely good letters of recommendation
* As far as MFA writing samples are concerned, I have piles and piles of half finished manuscripts, but very little finished work. This is why I want to pursue my MFA, I need somewhere to provide me with the time and support to finish my creative work, rather than just starting it and then having life intrude and disrupt it.
* I have no published work.
* I was a member of no organizations, clubs or extra-curricular activities.

When I have asked other people for advice, they give me advice that is 30 years out of touch with what schools are like now (a great uncle telling me how UVA was just grateful to have someone apply for grad school in English), or they give me the same advice they would give a straight A student laden with extra curricular accolades. What do I do in my 2.52 situation? If I faltered once, is my future prerogative to pursue academia precluded?

So realistically, what are my chances of getting into graduate school? And is there anything I can do (choosing certain schools or approaching my application from a different angle) to help me get into a decent program somewhere?",2,2014-10-22 12:51:56

I am currently in my 10th year of undergrad. I was undiagnosed with two mental illnesses and ADHD until three years ago, and I didn't get any medication for anything until two days ago when I ended up in the ER for suicide ideation. Needless to say, my undergraduate career has been very rocky. I am still determined to get my degree, however, I have a history of drops and one semester where severe depression and two illnesses in the family caused me to just drop out of school completely mid-semester.

I am in a great school now where I receive a lot of support, and things are starting to turn around. When I'm not battling my mental illnesses, I am an A/B student. I recently received an A in Calc I and am on track to receive ABs in Calc II and Intro to Computer Programming with Calc III, Discrete Math, and Intro to Computer Science on deck for next semester. 

I am being encouraged by advisors from both the school I plan to apply to and those at my school to explain my difficulties in school, especially since I have been advocating to be diagnosed and treated since my sophomore year of college but was met with roadblocks. 

How can I talk about this in my application without becoming inappropriately personal? 

Just to add: I can definitely get plenty of recommendation letters that speak to my determination to do well in school.

2jeu19,KestrelLowing,t2_9ol1s,Any hope for me eventually getting back into academia after failing miserably?,"So, long story short, I flunked out of my masters program I was attempting due to clinical depression and having no local support system to help with this.  I flunked a class I needed to graduate and was unable to finish my thesis (I was one class and half a thesis away from graduating, but depression doesn't listen to any logic!).

Anyway, I left my masters program and unfortunately, I probably didn't do it in the best way I could have.  I really did try to tie up all the loose ends so that another student could take up my research, but it took much longer than it should have, and I know my ex-adviser was not pleased with my work.  (Once again, depression is a bitch)

I now am working in industry.  I'm a design engineer in R&amp;D working in new product development for a medical device company.  But this isn't what I want to do long-term.  Ideally I'd like to go back to academia, get a masters focused on controls and robotics and maybe go onto a PhD so that I can be involved in more new things.  My other research interests lie in engineering education as I'm particularly interested in how to teach advanced technical subjects in other ways besides lecture.  (So like, grad level courses)

I have a much better handle on my depression now (mainly due to actually having a support system) and believe that I might be able to handle the workload of grad school within the next few years as I learn coping mechanisms.

Problems: 
* I'm currently doing absolutely nothing with controls and there's not many places
* My grad school grades are abysmal.  I think I had something like a 2.8  (in undergrad I got a 3.69)
* I don't have anyone to give me letters of rec from academia.  My old adviser shouldn't be asked because I was objectively horrible.  The other two profs I would have asked before have died and have left academia.  I can probably ask my tech lead and manager to give me letters of rec, but they'll be from industry, not academia

I'm currently in my third semester (I'm an undergraduate) and this past month and a half has been the toughest and most stressful time so far. Things went *really* well last year and I passed all my exams with good grades but things aren't going so well right now. I have *no idea* how to pass my current course/class.

Ever since I decided what to study (which was quite a few years ago but I took a few gap years between high school and university, which is common to do here) I've known what I want. I wanted to study to get a bachelor's degree, master's degree and then earn a PhD and go into medical research in either neuroscience, biomedicine or infection biology. However, this summer I was accepted to a summer research program where I got to work in a real research lab and I realized working in such a lab isn't really what I thought it'd be like. I didn't dislike it or anything but it wasn't really what I expected it to be (perhaps that's just because I'm an undergraduate and I don't know that much yet).

Since then I've sort of doubted my goal. What if I don't want to spend my whole life in a research lab? What if I won't like it? I don't really know what to do with my life. I know I want an education and I know I don't want to work with anything but science, but I don't really know what to do with that right now.

Doubting my goal, being a perfectionist, dealing with depression and stuff plus all the stress at university are all factors that have led to my motivation being virtually non-existent nowadays. I don't feel motivated at all and since I'm dependent on motivation to actually do well at university, I feel like I'm not doing that well right now. That, in turn, makes me even less motivated so now I'm stuck in some sort of vicious cycle of stress and despair and I don't know how to get inspired and motivated again.

I know I can't be the only student going through these things so I thought I'd reach out here and see if any of you have any advice (I hope this is the appropriate subreddit for this). What have you done to get through periods where you lack motivation? How do you figure out what to do with your education?

Thank you.",0,2014-10-12 06:39:27
2ix489,soceng,t2_d5ilz,Undergrad considering grad school...,"I'm currently a junior sociology major at a SLAC. I love social theory, I love thinking and I love ideas. Regardless of whether I was in school or not, I would still love to read theoretical works. My advisor (someone whom I respect very highly) has told me that I should go to grad school - specifically, into a PhD program. I have heard similar suggestions from two of my other professors. One of these professors even said, ""Whether you go now or later on in life, I expect that you will have a PhD level of knowledge within 10 to 15 years."" 

While I feel that grad school would be great for me, I'm unsure about it. Honestly, hearing this from my professors has actually scared me a little. Psychologically, I don't feel ready. I've been trying to sort out my depression and I'm worried that that might get in the way of graduate studies. So I've come to two possible decisions: either go directly into graduate school after completing my undergrad or wait a few years before going into a graduate program. 

I've been starting to drift towards the idea of waiting a few years. That would perhaps grant me some economic stability and allow me to sort things out before I really figure out a plan for what I want to even do for the rest of my life. 

The main question I have in mind is this: what would be a fitting job for the next few years ahead of me? I don't know what sorts of jobs for which I would fit best; I don't know which jobs would appreciate abstract thinking. I've heard of intelligence analysts - specifically, I've been reading up on the FBI's analyst position. I know that I may be asking the wrong subreddit for this advice, but I would appreciate any at all. Also, if this would be better asked somewhere else, please let me know. Thank you",7,2014-10-11 03:57:16
2h65q3,[deleted],,"physics PhD soon, deciding what's next","I started my PhD back in 2008, at a rank 25ish state school.  In 2009 I joined a research group doing theoretical condensed matter research with applications in quantum information.  My first project with the group was a satisfying success, and in 2010 it led to a good publication.

My qualifying exams in 2010 were a nightmare.  I cracked under the stress and entered years of depression and suicidal thinking (they eventually gave me a pity pass).   

I finally got myself back on track in 2013, and got involved with a large numerical project that lead to a publication.  This coincided with me becoming a long-term visitor at a top tier school, and some of my co-authors on this publication are famous professors in my sub-field.

I have one more paper I'm writing up now, which is numerical work with an undergrad.  I am not really proud of this work but I am kind of desperate to bolster my teaching credentials as a back up plan, since I need to apply for my next position really soon and I don't think I have done well enough in research to merit a post doc.   I enjoy teaching and am good at it, but I have been an RA for the past 6 years so on paper I don't appear to have much teaching experience.

Ideally I would like to stay in academia.  I was 16 when I decided to become a theoretical physics professor.  But maybe doing full-time research has peter-principled me beyond my own competence (I excelled more at learning and teaching textbook material).  I guess there is a small chance that I could be a late bloomer in research (part of why I have so few publications is that I spent a ton of time working on deep problems, and I perpetually feel on the verge of the making progress but it never materializes).  

Besides my barely-enough-to-graduate 2.5 publications, I'll also have 2-3 letters of recommendation from well known professors who seem to like me.  My advisor thinks I have a decent chance of getting a post doc, but to me it seems unrealistic because of my lack of publications.  Also I am worried that even if I get a post doc I will be unable to fulfill the expectations of that role.  I need to build confidence.  I still want a research career, but failing that I want to aim for being a professor at a teaching-oriented university.  What kind of positions do you all think I should apply for?  How should I make the most out of my last year as a grad student?",1,2014-09-22 22:21:39
2n8jiw,WiiPu,t2_jkbci,Guilt over wanting to quit undergraduate research position,"I'm a junior in college and I got a position as an undergraduate volunteer research assistant last June. When the professor and I were discussing expectations for my involvement, we decided that the minimum amount of involvement would be ~40hrs/week in the summer and ~13 hrs/week for the fall semester. In the summer I mostly assisted my grad student w/ various tasks, and at the start of the fall semester I got my own project to work on. Well, it's the middle of the fall semester and I think I want to quit after the semester ends. No one in my research group has any idea; they think I want to work in the lab until I graduate (though I have never expressed such sentiments).

However, I learned I'm not very passionate about research and the possibility of grad school, and I haven't been able to balance schoolwork and lab work very effectively (along with bouts of depression/suicidal thoughts). The nature of the work involves setting aside large amounts of time (sometimes up to 7hrs of active work) to complete experiments, and I feel this is very difficult to do with a challenging course load. These facts may be just excuses, though. I'm satisfied with the amount of time I put into the lab during the summer, but I haven't put in near the amount of time that was expected during the fall (~6-8 hrs/week as opposed to 13hrs/week). I do make sure to communicate with my grad student my time difficulties.

My guilt lies in the facts that I:

 1) haven't made any real progress on my project. That is, I have practically nothing to show after a semester's worth of work. It seems that every week during group meetings when we discuss updates in our research I have nothing to present. Every goddamn week, and it's my fault. I know. This ties into my not putting in the hours to get experiments done.

2) The grad student who I work with has invested an incredible amount of time in helping me learn about techniques and concepts about the research, and I haven't contributed anything close to justify the level of support I've received. My leaving the group would be a lost investment when he was expecting me to stay and possibly publish results.

3) I recently received an internship offer at a company for the following summer, and I just told my professor the exciting news. However, I feel that telling him now about want to quit might make him feel used as a means to an end and bad feelings may be had. Though I do value his being one of my references, my sentiments about the group existed long prior to the news about the internship.

The question is, do I continue paying my dues into the next semester, or should I tell my professor my feelings, and what would be the most gracious way to do so? I love being around the grad students and the professor as they are great people and have contributed a lot to my personal development, but I just don't want to do the research anymore.

I don't know, any words of advice would be greatly appreciated. It just made me feel a little better to write this down. Thanks for reading.",4,2014-11-24 05:22:05
2lizxb,Animostas,t2_4sqg4,Current Plan: Would appreciate some input/suggestions,"Hi, I'm currently an undergraduate at Columbia University, nearly halfway through my senior year.

I had kind of a rough undergraduate experience, not really knowing what to study for a while, some personal issues (depression/anxiety, which is now under control after a year of therapy), and not working nearly as hard as I should have. I was a music major for my first 1.5 years, and switched to astrophysics halfway through my sophomore year. I was somewhat mediocre at it, mostly due to my lack of hard work, and I'm hovering at about a 3.3 GPA at the moment.

About 2 years ago, I started to get some experience in mechanical engineering and I'm loving it. I'm currently working in a lab in mechanical engineering, and taking a graduate level course in engineering mechanics. I have several publications in various journals for engineering and a good history of lab experience at other universities as well as at Columbia.

My current plan is to take a year or two off and find some lab tech positions to help pad my resume and make sure that this is what I want to do before going ahead with graduate school in engineering mechanics. I'll be taking the GRE and doing applications at this time, so I definitely won't be doing anything for this application cycle. I'll also be looking for fellowships to sort of alleviate the cost. Meanwhile, I'll try to take whatever high level engineering courses I can, although I'll be a little limited since I'm still finishing my astrophysics courses.

Is there anything else I should do to be moving along? In particular, one of the ideas I'm toying with is to get a Master's, and then apply to Ph.D programs afterwards. That would sort of help out with my poor undergraduate performance and might give me a boost in applying for my Ph.D, as opposed to just applying to Ph.D programs straight off.

Thanks!",2,2014-11-06 23:51:31
2r91dm,[deleted],,"How do I ""start over"" (i.e. make up for my mistakes)?","The first part of this post is my educational history.  If that's not important or relevant, skip to the second part.

I'm about to start my 5th semester in undergrad, and I honestly wish I could go back to high school and do everything over now that I *kind of* know what I'm doing and certainly know what I want to do.  

I graduated from a terrible-quality private high school at the age of 16 (5th in my class; 3.8 GPA) after having been homeschooled from the ages of 12-14.  During those high school years, I held multiple competitive internships, won many awards, was captain of the scholastic bowl team, and did a bunch of other stuff that showed my intellectual aptitude to be something of high caliber and certainly something not to worry about. 

After that, I went to a community college and earned the Associate of Arts degree.  I am the first student out of my immediate family and any of my relatives to go to college.  My semesters varied a bit, with semester GPA's of:

* Fall 2012 – 2.62 GPA (20 credits; one grade F)
* Spring 2013 – 2.44 GPA (16 credits; three grades C)
* Fall 2013 – 3.00 GPA (15 credits; one grade D)
* Spring 2014 – 4.00 GPA (14 credits; one withdraw)
* Summer I 2014 – 4.00 GPA (3 credits)
* Summer II 2014 – 2.40 GPA (10 credits; two grades C)

Beginning with the Fall 2014 semester, I transferred to a semi-respected liberal arts college.  The transition to, among other things, living on campus and being hit with really difficult work in all my classes didn't help the anxiety I was already feeling after the previous two years.  I finished last semester with:

* Fall 2014 – 2.44 GPA (16 credits; Calc II grade D+)

This semester, I will be taking five academic classes (15 credits) along with 3 credits of music lessons and performance.  I'm *extremely* interested in four of those classes, the professors are wonderful, and I know of at least a few great students in each class, so I think those things will encourage me to do better this semester.  

As for myself, I've learned a few things through the transition, so I now feel at least slightly better equipped to do well this semester.  After having taken a few classes in the subject, I now know exactly what I want to study and what I want to do with it.  That has given me a spark of motivation.  Additionally, I am going to start medication for the first time to treat my ADD and depression.  I have at least some hope that getting those taken care of will help me in school.

-----------------------

**The main concern right now is this:** Due to both financial and personal circumstances, I will be transferring after this semester.  I will likely spend 4-5 semesters at whichever institution I transfer to.  Because I plan to complete an MA and a PhD (separately) after undergrad, and I hope to someday teach at the collegiate level, I need to figure out:

1. How to transfer to another good undergrad institution,
2. How to do well from here on out,
3. How to look like a strong candidate for grad school, despite my mistakes.

I know that I've completely thrown away some of the prospects I had in high school, but I'd like to believe that I can still study somewhere good and land a solid job in academia in the future despite the rough experiences I had in the first few years of undergrad.  

Any advice on really anything would be much appreciated.",2,2015-01-04 00:02:49
2qyzwt,odin_the_wanderer,t2_8iz3w,I'm 21 (22 in April) and I don't have a bachelor's. Is it too late to pursue a career in academia?,"I was briefly in school for about 3/4 of a semester, but ended up having to drop all of my classes due to some personal issues that came up, namely extreme (i.e. suicidal) depression which precluded me from doing well. I always wanted to be in academia when I was young, and I did enjoy my time in it while I was (albeit in a limited capacity due to the aforementioned depression). 

All that being said, while I really want to get back into it, I wonder if it's too late to do anything meaningful. I worry about credentials, and I have somewhat of a crippling lack in self-confidence as it is.

So basically, assuming I'm right, and academia is for me (or would be, anyhow) is it worthwhile to try and get back into it? I've spent my time in between doing various things, but I've spent the last year employed as a computer programmer, something I find incredibly unfulfiling. I know, I know, grass is greener and all that, and I know that independent study is probably vastly different from being in college, but I just feel like academia would be much more in line with what I get out of life. However, on the flipside I don't want to spend my time on someting that won't ever come to fruition. Also, just to be clear, by ""pursuing a career in academia"" I mean going back to school, getting an undergrad, then going on to grad school.",0,2015-01-01 01:24:50
2ophvl,dcbarcafan10,t2_9tp9a,Academic/Career Advice [Long Read},"First and foremost thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this and offer advice, it's much appreciated. 

Background:

I graduated from the University of Central Florida in May 2013 after completing degrees in Biotechnology and Bio-medical Sciences. My undergraduate career was a somewhat misguided affair, influenced both by my inability to choose an academic path ( I simply didn't know what I wanted to do) and my mother's somewhat pervasive idea that she'd delight in my becoming a doctor. So that's what I tried for. As much as I tried convincing myself I'd become a doctor, I didn't truly believe it, and I didn't truly want it. And so, given that the means didn't justify the ends...I struggled. I trudged along for 5 years, didn't accrue any research experience, forged few relationships with professors, and became involved in clubs only at the end of my career. My GPA settled at a 3.0 upon graduation. Some of these difficulties came from an hour commute to school, in conjunction with a 20-30 hour/week job as a dishwasher just frankly left me tired.

 I'm not afraid of being tired. I'm 25 and I've worked since I was 13 years old. My family (only my mom and my sister  in this country, as we're immigrants from Costa Rica)...we're a bunch of work-mules. If there's one thing my family has, it's work ethic. And I know I'm intelligent. But I digress. 

Having graduated, and still chasing the faint notion of an M.D, I studied for the MCAT and hated every minute of it. I couldn't justify, nor did I want to, become a physician. 

At this point, I reached a somewhat critical juncture in my life. Two things happened in December of 2013: I began seeing a therapist and also began doing research as a post-bacc with my Biochemistry professor from Undergrad, who was kind enough to offer me a spot helping further a project.

Therapy was certainly revelatory. My therapist concluded that I'd suffered from Dysthimia, Anxiety, and paranoid ideation. The dysthimia probably began (we concluded) at least a decade ago. For some perspective, the first time I thought about suicide I was 12 years old. It's my observation that my dysthimia probably would have been full-grade depression had it not been for my mother keeping me active in athletics virtually all my life (natural endorphins and all that, which are apparently at about as effective as actual anti-depressants). I'd always suffered from poor self-image, horribly low confidence, and a horribly ingrained self-defeatist mentality, which though I kept that to myself, did not aid in any successes.  

As far as laboratory is concerned, the experience helped me narrow down what I feel I should be doing in that while I enjoy science, learned much about experimental design and different techniques and the like... I just don't feel I would have been a good scientist (aside from maybe pursuing engineering). 

Along this period of time, I became much more involved in educating myself politically. I've now delved into studies on government, and political theory, human rights issues and history...and man does that make me tick. The one fundamental difference I noticed between what I majored in and what I study now is that while biological science was interesting...I never asked any questions. I didn't have a curiosity for it beyond the courses I was taking. However, when I return from work each and every day and study the aforementioned subjects I'm constantly in wonderment, and asking questions, and thinking about things to research...it's this driving curiosity that wasn't there before. I mean, this is what I do. I come home and enjoy studying texts of academic rigor on all of those subjects. I've fallen in love with comparative politics and international relations, which I know is broad but those two fields are so incredibly interesting.

Anyway. In June I began seeing a psychiatrist. She said I have ADHD, which I began to suspect given my difficulties at work (I managed to talk my way into a job as a Microbiologist), and my prior difficulties in academia. In addition, apparently those afflicted are predisposed towards depression and anxiety, and sometimes bipolar disorder. Needless to say, everything at least made some sort of sense. It's something akin to knowing your money is being stolen and knowing who is doing the stealing. Whether I found out now or earlier wouldn't have made much of a difference; My mom's always struggled financially and we've never had health insurance. It wasn't until this year that I finally had cash to finally figure all this out. 

But my love for these kinds of studies isn't really just an end in itself. I want to do something with it. I have to do something with it. I come from a family that has known poverty: my mom grew up on a banana plantation in the poorest province of Costa Rica and was shuttled from home to home, sometimes within an abusive household, my grandmother managed a 6th grade education, was raped and abused as a child, beat by a former husband as a woman...my uncle used to do cocaine and steal...my father's never been present and has never acknowledged me or divulged my existence to my other siblings, I was sexually abused by my best friends older brother when I was a young kid... my mother's financial struggles caused an inordinate amount of stresses in and of themselves...so obviously there exist many issues around the globe that are personal. I empathize, but they also certainly mean something different. I look at something such as diplomacy, or the theories that educate diplomacy, and see myself as someone who could contribute within that arena. 

 I understand that life is unfair. But it's fair in that it is also unfair for everyone. So I'm really, really trying to work with what I understand and have been given and am coming to people who may have advice on what steps I might take to be a success. 



So that's where I'm at. I'm sitting here with 2 degrees, a 3.0 GPA, a new understanding of myself, struggles overcome...etc. I don't particularly subscribe to the idea of closed doors, so that's good. I just finished working something near 80 hours per week for the last 7 months, so I'm no stranger to hard work. I'm intelligent, and I'm more than willing to work towards acquiring the skills that might make me someone capable. I've read plenty of stories online of individuals who maybe struggled academically as I did, and still managed admission to incredible institutions (Harvard Kennedy School, Yale, Stanford, Georgetown...etc) so there is obviously still a way. I don't mean to imply that those institutions are what I am entitled to, but if I work hard and with diligence, I can obviously attend a great program. I guess it might be the academic version of reaching for the moon and landing among the stars, or whatever. 

I need to take a step, any step, in a forward direction, but have no idea where to proceed. My initial plan was applying for readmission to UCF to study their International Relations, or Political Science, or even Economics B.A. programs, and then apply to graduate school, having the experience and understanding I do now. But I certainly need help because I know I cannot do this alone. 

Again, to anyone who reads this, thank you so much.",0,2014-12-09 01:30:15

2v7y9z,depriphd,t2_l8iul,Depressed PhD student: what to do?,"I'll try to keep this short (and I failed; feel free to skip to the last paragraph). 

I moved halfway across the globe to pursue a PhD in the only topic that kind of interests me. I've been [chronically depressed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia) for basically as long as I can remember (which is a little different than [clinical depression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder)), but it's hitting me extra hard now, because what I'm doing is no longer easy and I have no social life to fall back on (it was never much, but still much better than here).

I've been prescribed different kinds of antidepressants and I'm seeing a psychiatrist, but none of it seems to do anything. I'm alternating between periods of low productivity and extremely low productivity, where I can regularly not even bring myself to get out of bed and to the university, and I don't think my supervisor notices. In a previous bad period I did tell her and she responded pretty understanding, but all subsequent talks were just business-as-usual. This is probably mostly due to me because I've been dealing with this for a long time and since people don't like a downer and I don't like talking about it, the facade of acting like nothing is wrong has become my default behavior over the past 15+ years.

Now she wants me to finish some stuff that I should have done ages ago and isn't even that difficult, but I'm greatly struggling with it and have made virtually no progress over the past year. I should probably have written ""I can't"" rather than ""I'm struggling"", but that seems so stupid. I can read, I can write, I'm supposed to be pretty smart, I'm sure I seem relatively healthy to anyone who sees me, and it even feels to me that I could easily get back into it and make significant progress tomorrow because it's not that goddamn difficult. But I always feel that way, and it almost never happens. I guess I'm waiting for the day that it does (not a great plan, I know), but I'm afraid my supervisor's patience is rightfully going to run out when she really sees the lack or progress or learns how I spend most of my time. My career is pretty much all I have in life, so losing it would be very bad (although perhaps not undeserved).

I don't really know what to do any more. I already tried antidepressants, talking to a psychiatrist and my supervisor and none of it ""helped"". I'm not sure what kind of advice /r/AskAcademia could give. I guess I'd like to hear what you would do if I were your PhD student, or perhaps some experiences from people in this situation...

Thanks for your time!

Edit: Thank you everybody for your time, advice and support! I'm sorry that for a lot of it I have responded somewhat negatively by giving reasons why it didn't or probably won't work for me, or with lame excuses for why I won't be able to do something.

2u8dsn,[deleted],,A lot of stupid questions about post-undergraduate education (English Lit.) (U.S.A.),"I'm a junior and an English major. I just talked to my favorite instructor. She said that she really thinks I should go to grad school, but that to remember that I will probably live in inescapable poverty and I may turn to abusing drugs and/alcohol to cope with the depression. She finished undergrad for free because of a scholarship. She gets a $10,000/year (9mo) stipend and is about $30,000 in debt, and she's almost finished with her PhD.  
  
1. Is this a normal amount of stipend to receive and debt to be in?  
  
2. Do scholarships exist for grad school like they do for undergrad? Is it possible to go to grad school for free, and where can I get more info on grad school loans, if they exist?  
  
3. ""Grad school"" covers people who are working on Masters as well as PhDs, correct? Or is PhD ""post graduate?""    
  
4. What is day-to-day life like for someone working on a Masters, and compared to someone working on a PhD? I'm not sure I understand the difference aside from PhD being very specific.  
  
5. What type of work or activity do you typically have to show to continue receiving your stipend? 
  
6. When are you supposed to apply to grad school?  
  
7. How many schools is it normal to apply to? It seems like you're incentivized to only apply to a few since they charge you money.  
  
8. How do you choose schools to apply to? Do you pick based on which period/specialization of literature you're interested in? How do you know if a school is a good fit for you?  
  
9. Do people usually try to go to grad school away from where they got their undergrad?

I'm a 24 year old neuroscience PhD student (just starting my third year) who will hopefully finish up at the end of next year. Ever since I was in undergrad I thought I've wanted to be a research scientist. So I completed undergrad, did honours (I'm Australian) and went straight into my PhD. Now I'm finding I don't want to do research at all because job prospects are terrible and I've absolutely lost my passion. I want to finish the degree because I've come this far, but after I finish I don't want to continue on with a postdoc. My problem is that outside of this, I've had no work experience. I've struggled with severe depression and anxiety my whole life so couldn't handle a job and school/university at the same time, so forewent the job on both occasions. And even when focusing entirely on school, I still didn't do very well. My undergrad GPA is only 2.5. I'm really panicking about what I'm going to do when I finish. Ideally I'd work in administration or do routine pathology/histology in a hospital, but from what I've read I'll be overqualified but also have no actual experience, so will be doubly undesirable. I want to get a job that I can do for a couple of years while I sort myself out, but I feel like I'll end up a checkout chick or flipping burgers at Maccas, and even then I'm overqualified/under-experienced and they may as well pay a 15 year old to do the same thing. Am I a lost cause? Is finishing my PhD going to hurt me in the long run? Does anyone have any suggestions to jobs I could do? Thank you all so much for reading to the end. I appreciate it.

2y07xs,camthrowaway111,t2_lwm3v,Accepted to Cambridge PhD and Scared Shitless - Is this Normal? HELP,"
Hi, I'm a 20 year old female and I've just finished a 3-year Bachelor's degree in Biology from a science uni in London. I've been accepted to a 3-year funded PhD programme at Cambridge University in the life sciences/medicine under a supervisor who is very eager, hands-on and one of the most engaged professors I have ever met. It is clear that he is an amazing supervisor, and I consider myself very fortunate to have landed in his very capable hands. However, I can't help but feel extremely insecure, and was wondering whether these are normal things to feel upon embarking on a PhD (without a prior Master's qualification). I have a history of anxiety and depression, and have struggled with similar feelings before, so it is difficult for me to disentangle ""normal"" feelings of fear/excitement from worrisome feelings that may be indicative of a potential red light. Here are the main things I'm feeling/thinking:

1. I feel very much ""fraudulent."" In saying this, I don't mean that I've faked anything on my CV/resume, since I have earnestly performed all lab techniques listed (albeit some only once or twice). My lab project is not based on these techniques, but I feel as though my supervisor is grossly overestimating my degree of expertise in what is supposed to be my comfort zone - molecular biology. I know that grasping new techniques does not take long and that these are feelings every member has prior to joining a lab, but I am scared that my supervisor's expectations will be completely shattered.

2. I'm not sure to what degree my diligence can offset the paucity in expertise. I am a very hard worker, and once I get into a project, I find it easy to become very therein immersed. However, the PhD is in a completely new field that is very much medical, as opposed to my previous lab experiences, which were focused more on the mechanisms of pathogenesis, rather than their outcomes and management. I'm not sure every PhD student has an adjustment period where they must wade through instructional materials and mountains of recent literature to accustom themselves to the jargon and leading themes in their field, or whether I am in way over my head. 

I hope that you will be able to shed some light on whether these are normal insecurities for a prospective PhD student to have, or whether the reservations raise significant concern. Thanks in advance :)

2xmppv,[deleted],,Is pursuing a master's degree a wise decision for someone who fails at life?,"I realize that question is very vague, but I'm looking for as much good advice as I can get.
I'm interested in studying either pure or computational mathematics. I'd like to earn a master's degree (and ideally a PhD), but I'm concerned that I would just be wasting a lot of time and money. Six years ago I graduated with honors from a highly respected college where I earned a bachelor's degree in computer and electrical engineering. As a student I assumed it would be relatively easy to get a good job with these credentials. However I've always been sorely underemployed due primarily to three problems: I graduated during a historic economic downturn, I lacked relevant experience, and I'm a self-loathing misanthrope with debilitating depression and self-diagnosed autism.
I guess what I'm asking is, what do I need to be successful - either in academia or industry - with an advanced degree in mathematics? Is there some way I can convince people I would be an asset to their organization when I almost certainly won't believe it myself?

2w42er,[deleted],,"How do I learn physics and engineering, working from the (very) basics up?","Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night! I apologize if this is not the proper subreddit in which to submit my post.

I am currently a high schooler that's deeply interested in learning physics and engineering - really, what holds our cosmos together, and what we've created from it. Due to my school's structuring and scheduling, it will most likely not be possible for me to take any advanced physics classes at this point, with everything else I'll be taking, and even more impossible for me to learn coding or engineering in depth. (Due to wasting months of opportunities with my depression, constantly being out of school and in therapy, I had to drop down to simpler classes to accommodate my life - which now requires me to make up some of the parts that I missed in courses next year, if I wish to continue math and science - which I do). 

With little knowledge in physics or engineering, though a burning desire to understand how computers work, and what quantum mechanics is, I would like to figure out how to learn both these subjects as if I was taking them as courses in school, though by using online resources to do so. 

The problem is, many resources I find online assume the student to have a large background knowledge in mathematics and basic physics, both which I do not have (being a high schooler and all). I want to learn everything I could have learned in my advanced classes if I hadn't lost my place, and more, if possible.

Do you have suggestions about what I might be able to do fill in my knowledge and start learning from the basics, so I'm not completely confused when I start learning it?

I have a book in my possession by Isaac Asimov, ""Understanding Physics"", and I found ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"" free online (sponsored by CalTech). I haven't started them yet, though.

1fnaoo,throwaway14777,t2_bwvei,"Explaining depression to future universities, worth it?","I'm crossposting this from /r/depression if that's okay, since it didn't get any responses and this is a more relevant sub. I'll add a tl;dr at the bottom if you don't want to read my wall of text.

A bit of background: I'm 19 and have had moderate to severe depression and anxiety for the past 8 or 9 years. I've been in and out of counselling and had a brief stint of normalcy that lasted about a year and a half (ended this past autumn). That normalcy was brought about by me getting serious with my boyfriend who is my rock, and because of him I applied to go to university in England (I'm American, he's British) and we moved in together, and with my life looking so positive and happy all of the negative feelings faded. However, when I started my course, I became incredibly depressed. I realised I hated my course and talked to my advisor about switching out but it was too late in the year.

I managed to do alright (mentally) the first 4 months, but when I had a critique on my 3rd project that I was beyond proud of and the teachers hated it, I just snapped. My teachers had always humiliated me throughout the year, and I'd regularly leave the class to cry or take a breather, so I was just fed up. In February I stopped going to classes regularly. I went once a week, then once a fortnight, then once a month, and then we had all of April off and didn't go in during May at all. I spent the time lying in bed or moping about the flat. I missed my final portfolio review for my course, but I have 2 final exams for my other non-course-related subjects next week that I do plan on attending.

But back in September when I went to switch out of my course, I also realised I should apply to other universities for my new course. I've since heard back from all of them, and 3 out of 5 (2 rejections, not surprised) said that if I pass at a 60-65% for this year then I'm in. Unfortunately, I'm looking at a 40%. I talked to a few friends and my parents and they all suggested I write a letter explaining that I had a bad experience with the course and my depression and I was wondering if I could get the conditions relaxed a bit. The other 2 classes that I took that aren't related to my current course are related to the course I want to switch to, and I have a 70+ in those, so I hope I could use those as proof that I would do well in the new subject.

I've always been really embarrassed about my depression, and it's hard for me to put it into words. Anyway, how do I do this? Is this even a good idea? If there are any UK redditors, do you think this will help, or will they just toss my letter aside?

tl;dr: Finished my first year of uni in the UK as an American, but didn't get good marks due to depression/terrible experience. Applied to other unis, received conditionals that I can't achieve, want to write a letter explaining my situation, need general feedback if this is a good idea and what to include/leave out.

Any and all help is greatly appreciated.",10,2013-06-04 12:10:54
1eiwg4,oldhatter1998,t2_bpmp5,Dear Redditor's I need your advice. I am soon to be PhD graduate who survived 15 months of severe depression and now need career advice.,"Hey Redditors I am in need of some serious help.
I have been battling severe depression for the last 15 months and only now the fog is kind of lifting. I was towards the end of my PhD when my depression struck and as I was hospitalized for about 8 months I had to take an extended leave of absence. My professor was nice enough to allow me to finish when I got better but the project unfortunately was in a very competitive field and my results have already been published by a competing lab. So I have been suggested to write up my thesis without any publications as that is accepted here for a getting a degree. I have a lot of laboratory experience and also have been the elected representative of my graduate school and have been the head of an organizing committee which has successfully organized international symposiums for 3 years with prestigious speakers from around the world including Noble Laureates.
My depression was the result of certain repressed memories from my childhood (sexual abuse by my older sibling and cousin) making an unwelcome appearance in the conscious part of my brain. I went through intensive trauma therapy and had to work very hard to get back to my 'normal' life.
Now that I am trying to pick up the pieces of my life I find myself in a ridiculous position where suddenly my career does not seem as bright, my once wide social circle has shrunk down to a core few and everyone is busy accomplishing things while I am stuck in one place.
I feel like I am done with being in the lab 24/7. the past 15 months have obviously changed me as a person and my research which was a very big part of my life is no longer something I identify with. I no longer see myself doing a postdoc and working in academia and discovering brilliant things in my field. It was a very hard decision but I realized that I don't want to spend the next 10 years in a lab. Having said that I still love science and cannot imagine leaving the field altogether. I have an excellent bachelors degree and two masters degrees and lot of experience in labs around Europe.
The things that still make me happy are editing my colleagues/students written works as well as promoting the exchange of ideas between scientists or students not just within my discipline but across the varied fields of science.
I would love to join either a scientific journal/publishing house or manage an international graduate school. This is where I need your help Redittors, any suggestions of what kind of job I could look for. What career opportunities are available for someone who wants to remain in science but give up the lab.
I have posted some incredibly personal stuff here so I created a new login just for this. I have been a Redditor since my depression started and I always love the support I have gotten from /r/ depression and will always be thankful for that :)

P.S. I posted this in /r/jobs first and someone suggested that I try /r/academia as well so I am cross posting. ",26,2013-05-17 16:17:47
1e9ze5,Eventhorizon28,,How to deal with difficult fellow grad student colleagues? With academic politics?,"I am a PhD student in a very intimate, highly competitive humanities program. In the last few years, with the closing of many tenure track positions around the country and decreased funding immediately available to my program, my colleagues have become understandably very stressed, some very mentally ill (2 nervous breakdowns, depression, panic disorders, etc). The faculty turns a blind eye and I understand that for many, this is just a part of grad school and the ""experience."" However, we have a small handful of particularly toxic grad students for whom nothing is ever good enough and virulent gossip ensues where they tear each other and their accomplishments apart. As a result, the health of the department has declined even further and three students have decided to leave. The faculty has told us to not socialize with those leaving. 

I understand that, for the remainder of our lives in academia, this kind of lawlessness, gossip, and back-stabbing will always (unfortunately) be present to some degree. I'm a young, married student and I have mostly decided to stay out of departmental drama. I still attend all departmental events, readings, and colleague's birthdays/exam celebrations as a part of my professionalization. But, I do not gossip (woman in predom female dept) and, as a result, have been cut out by the ""mean girl"" crowd (best way to put it) because I refuse to talk destructively about others. I've had many mentors tell me to simply focus on my marriage and my research/teaching. I've never discussed specifics even with my former mentors. (hate the idea of airing out a dept's dirty laundry to others)

Question: In a world where you can forge life long reputations and relationships, how important is it to become close with all of your graduate student colleagues? (Considering that the ""mean girl"" crowd doesn't consist of the most driven students) How do you better protect yourself from idle academic gossip (besides working hard, being accountable and responsible, and damn it, compassionate)? In most other situations, I would not pay any mind, but I may be stuck with who knows who in the future. How do you better navigate academic social politics?",25,2013-05-13 23:09:18
1k6leq,ResurrectedFailure,t2_cq1lw,"I screwed up royally years ago, but multiple times. I've since resurrected myself and am doing incredibly well. How much will my past hold me back?","I'm not really looking to brag, but I may have screwed up my transcript more than anyone you've ever met. Well, hopefully not, but I wouldn't be surprised. It was, as I learned, a side-effect of a seasonal form of depression, which I now have 100% under control.

In the interests of anonymity, I'm going to be fairly vague, but I'm going to try to give the best answers that I can to any questions.

 - I began my college career in the 90's at arts trade school, where I studied for a year and experienced great success. Circumstances in my life were altered, and I left that school to live home again. I started the following semester, but withdrew before the deadline. This was the first 13 credits that I attempted to begin and failed to complete.

 - Five years later (in the 2000s), I returned to school and achieved 3 relatively solid semesters (the third semester, I withdrew from one class and failed another course). Everything else was probably a B average. At this point, I maintained my initial major.

 - The next semester, I experienced a few major life changes (the loss of a fiance, my parents moved across the country, and a few other things), and I withdrew from courses again (another 13 credits that I didn't complete (though I withdrew before failure)).

 - The following summer, I took 2 courses and maintained a B average. All seemed to be going back in the right direction.

 - The following fall, I had lost track of my major and withdrew from school for the third time (another 19 credits withdrawn). I found that my depression was basically keeping me from going anywhere other than a dead-end job and laying at home.

 - I reenrolled for the next semester, was still incapable of getting through it, but didn't even have the strength to face going in to withdraw from classes again. I had 18 failed credits.

 - The next semester, I found myself passing 3 of my 5 classes. I would have completely given up if I hadn't had a professor who inspired me. Of course, this was in a course completely irrelevant to any major I was looking for, but I had a great time. I got an A in her class.

 - Two more consecutive failing semesters where I added another 27 credits to my failing roster.

That's a total of 3.5 failing semesters, 3 withdrawn semesters. I am not going to go into any depth with respect to my depression, but I will now bring you up to speed with where I am currently:

 - I have changed majors from fine arts to a STEM subject. I have taken 52 credits at a community college and have a 3.75 GPA. I haven't had depressive issues for *years*, partly due to the fact that I moved to an area where I am no longer subject to my seasonal depression, and partly due to other factors that I've experienced in treatment.

 - I have a great reputation among my professors, and was actually hired by one of them to work as a lab assistant.

 - I am going to a state college, and have a fair number of friends who also go to this school. I am in my 30's now. 

I know that I'm pretty much never going to land a sweet MIT position in grad school. I am also pretty certain that I'm going to have this brought up every time I apply for anything where my transcript will come up. That said, I have been going on faith that I can redeem my incredibly shitty history and have a career in my science. I still have almost 3 years of course work to do before I graduate. I plan on taking either 3 or 4 courses at a time, only in the area of my major, but it took me a few courses to get my math and science prerequisites up to Freshman college level.

I'm accepted into my state college. I will be able to graduate with a Bachelor's degree. I ought to be able to get a job beyond college with my major and recommendations. I am curious, however, to know whether my atrocious history will effectively prevent me from going to grad school to continue my education in my subject, or if I should be able to overcome the obstacle of my past by the virtue of my more recent history.

Mind you, I've got a few more courses to go through in order to get to that point, and I'm going to get my Bachelor's in my subject regardless of what the responses are, but I want to have an understanding of the reality of my situation. Is the goal of continuing to the Master's and PhD level a pipe dream for me? 

Oh, and I've currently got about 140 college credits (and an Associate's degree to show for it).

**TL;DR:** Can someone who has failed/withdrawn from 6 full semesters of college in his youth be able to gain the respect of the academic community a decade later, after a number of years of hard work, dedication, and success, or will his background as the king of fuck-ups prevent him from being able to get into grad school?",3,2013-08-12 02:59:27

1ibnxg,[deleted],,MS Structural Engineering student in need of some serious advice. Strongly considering quitting.,"Hi,

I've been doing a lot of soul searching, and I am slowly formulating a decision on whether I should remain in grad school or not. I am a PhD student in civil engineering (structural emphasis), but I believe that a PhD is out of the question completely for me at this point.  

I just completed my second year at an ""average, nothing exceptional"" institution. I think it will take me at least one year to get my masters.

I got super depressed and burnt out after my second year. I had been feeling it for some time, and I tried to push through, but ultimately I lost all energy, passion, and motivation to go on. My adviser was very demanding, and additionally required me to take many courses outside of my major. In reality, I only have taken  2 structural engineering courses. The remainder of my courses have been EE and ME. This was particularly due to my research area, which is structural health monitoring, but honestly, in hindsight, I don't think it does me much good for a job in structural design. I would mind a ""structural health monitoring"" job, but I don't know if there is even a solid industry for that.

Last semester, I literally bombed both of my classes. I had to take an undergraduate mechanical engineering class (yeah I've taken two undergrad classes), and a graduate level EE class. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love the ME and EE subjects, its not like I wasn't interested in the material. It was just that I had no fucking way of dealing with all the stress at that point. 

The professor of the grad class that I bombed told me I have until Aug. 8th to take a final, comprehensive exam that would dictate my grade. I have barely studied. I can't bring myself to focus.

I also started smoking weed heavily to cope with the depression and stress. I don't see weed as a negative thing, but I do believe it is unhealthy for me to be smoking this much. I smoked through my first cigarette pack as well. So it doesn't seem like I'm headed in a good direction.

Its honestly come to a point where I can't even take care of myself properly. The notion of getting out of bed has become stressful, and simple tasks such as checking the mail have caused high amounts of stress. I've been on depression medication, and have not yet gone to therapy, though whether I quit or stay, I think therapy will be my next choice.

Although I am potentially close to a thesis masters, I honestly do not have the urge to continue.  I tried taking a break over the summer, but honestly, it hasn't helped much. I've been flirting with the idea for some time, and would really like to hear other peoples perspectives on what they would do in my situation.

 Let me tell you some of my credentials...this is engineering specific:

**Current Status**


* ~3 classes short for MS in Structural Engineering

* BS in Civil Engineering

* Previous internship experience

* FE license

* One 2nd author published journal paper

* Several conference papers/presentations

My idea is, I can't handle any grad school right now because I'm so burnt out and over it, so quit, take a break for a semester/look for an engineering job. Finish my MS (perhaps non-thesis) after I get a job. 


I really just want to know what other people think of my situation. Do you think I need to suck it up, or is quitting right before a MS thesis degree taking a step back. If you guys can please give me some advice, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1lwsj8,[deleted],,Can I still be a competitive PhD candidate?,"Ok, first some background. I have a BSc, and a BA, and am currently in the last half of an Honours year on top of my BSc (Physics, if it's relevant). I'm at a good university, and the Honours course is a good one, and quite challenging. It's half coursework, and half research. 

My research is going really well - I am lucky enough to be affiliated with a very respected industrial organisation, and my research falls under their umbrella. My group there is building a really exciting piece of infrastructure, which will be significant for our field for decades to come. I'm the only student in the group, and I've had the amazing chance to do some literally world-first tests with all the awesome new equipment. Even more amazingly, things have worked, and we have great results!

I love the work, and I would love to continue it at the PhD level. My group's also indicated that they are extremely keen to keep me -in my boss' words, 'if you want to stay, we'll make it happen'. However, since they're not a degree-granting institution, I need to be enrolled in a PhD program at a university, and strike up a co-supervision arrangement.

However, while my research has gone well this year, my coursework grades have not been so good (straight 'Pass' grades last semester). It's been a rough year - after frequent panic attacks, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety early in the year and placed on medication. This helped a little, but I still struggled, and my grades reflected it. I've recently been reassessed, and changed to a stronger, medication, and am feeling better.

However, my grades remain, and I have added a few poor assignment marks so far this semester, although I am hoping to do better from now on. At this stage, Class One honours is out of my grasp. Realistically, even an Upper Class Two honours might not happen. 

Otherwise, though I say it myself, I'm a pretty good PhD candidate. I have an excellent, even outstanding, research background for an Honours student - a variety of research projects on a range of topics, with some very respected researchers. A few well-known names are happy to act as referees for me.

I've received a number of scholarships, grants, commendations, etc. I've developed software for a range of applications in a number of languages, have good communication and writing skills (my BA is in journalism), and am a friendly, polite, confident person. I've not published before, but we are working on a paper based on my honours research, on which I will be first author. Perhaps most importantly, my bosses are gunning to keep me, and have offered to put in good words for me with their contacts wherever I am applying. 


So, after that essay, how should I approach my PhD scholarship applications? Is there any way I can avoid my low GPA automatically striking me out of consideration?

I have doctor's certificates stating that I have ongoing medical issues, which have affected my study this year, without stating specifically what they are. Would it be worth including a note to this effect, along with a doctor's certificate, in applications? 

I feel that would be an unusual step, so I wanted to float it here first. Could it count in my favour vis-a-vis my GPA? Or would  it simply get my application funny looks? Or worse, make me seem some sort of hypochondriac/special snowflake/chronically ill individual, too unreliable to make a good prospect?

My apologies again for the essay, but I would love to hear any thoughts!

1kugpv,throwaway5567895,t2_cujvb,How do I know when it's time to call it quits with my PhD in physics?,"A little background:  I'm 30, this year will be my 8th year in grad school.  During my first year they failed half my class on the screening exam (paper test on course work), which pissed off the entire department at the test writers/graders.  This set me back with research, and then my brother was killed in an accident.  I happened to inherit a small amount of money which I lost due to depression/stupid business venture/ too much generosity.  I managed to pass the screening on the second chance (you only get one second chance on that) three months after my brother died, but then I got burned out.  My family started fighting, and I made some dumb choices.  A year later I finally started research with my new adviser and I've been at it for about 4 years now. 

I've never been the best grad student.  My first project was kind of a dud and that cost me a year, but got me through my quals/candidacy exam.  I only published once on that project.

I then picked a second follow up project as part of my quals proposal, and I've been working on that one ever since, it's now been about two years and I have no data.  This project is so much harder than I could have possibly imagined.  Last year, my best friend died, and this year my grandfather died.  I'm now working insane hours and writing what I have, but I literally have ZERO data and it's been eight years of my life.  As a comparison, many of my students that I started with are still in the program, probably because of that first exam, but I'm further behind than most of them I feel.

Last night I spent a 24 hour period again attempting to acquire data, and it failed, again.  I actually expected this one to fail, but I needed to use up the remaining resources before I could redesign.  I am doing another round of building and testing over the next week.  I'm tired, frustrated and shot.

My adviser is funding me fully for the fall.  He's been funding me pretty consistently, but he got pissed at me this summer for not having a publication out.  It cost him a grant.  He got another grant, but he lost his old one in part because my work didnt publish.  I've made progress on the repeat-ability of parts of my experiment, and put it through multiple re-engineering phases to get it to work, but it's so fucking touchy that I'm afraid it's not feasible to get data from this.  I have no idea at what point I just say 'fuck it' and walk away with an MS for the work I published on.  My adviser thinks it will work, but I'm not so sure.

I dont wanna talk to him about this until I've failed at it a few more times due to his continued investment, but I really want to know, when do I just call a loser a loser and do something else?  Grad school has stolen my life.

Any advice would be nice.

EDIT:  I'm not exactly sure if the years add up.  It's approximate.  Some things overlapped.

EDIT 2:  Many people tell me in my field that if I can get this to work it will be a big deal.  High risk, high reward is a phrase I've heard a lot.",18,2013-08-22 01:50:40
1p3c9m,Vitalchimie,t2_ap1lc,How can I reach out to a professor who's work interests me?,"Not sure where to begin. I'm taking Organic Chemistry, which is the second year of Chemistry in my Biochem degree. My lab partner is taking Upper Division Chem (Fell behind in his lab courses for other reasons, so he's in my lower  division lab right now), and told me his professor is looking for undergrads at all levels to help with his research.

I just met with the professor today, and he didn't seem to know what I was talking about. He offered to email me some papers to read (He didn't really get in to what about, but I'm assuming they're at least *his* papers) and also offered to let me watch his grad students work and learn from their technique. Nothing that sounded like the undergrad research experience I'm looking for.

Another problem is I suffer from anxiety and depression, and I'm afraid I came off as bored or uninterested in his work, mostly because I can be extremely inarticulate (as I'm sure this post makes painstakingly obvious). The fact that this particular professor just came from a prestigious university and seems to be a very important person in this field made that all the worse.

The thing is, though, I *know* I'm interested in his work, I just don't know how to express that. I just read a local newspaper interview he did recently, and we share many of the same motivations (interest in biomedical research due to family members dying of a particular disease), and I just know I would love working in his lab, but what can I do at this point?

He told me to email him so he can have my address and send me the papers and his students' contact info, but I'm nervous as all hell about writing this email. I want to make sure he sees how interested I really am in this, but this is such a difficult task for me I just don't want to screw it up. I also feel like the clock is ticking, because if I wait too long it'll seem *obvious* that I'm not really interested...

1p1bjj,burntoutfedup,t2_dma9d,I think I want to quite my Ph.D.,"I created a new account for this, I'm in my 4th year of my Ph.D. program in ecology. I'm set to take my written exams in a few weeks, my proposal is in it's final edits, and this semester is the last of my classes. I've got a B-average. 

My program seems to have been plagued with hurdles: I attempted a duel degree program and the 2nd masters fell through; I Changed projects after my first year at the suggestion of my advisor; I Delt with a bout of depression that took a year to figure out; and I've moved to a new location and I am working from home now. 

I see my advisor very little, he manages a big research budget for multiple labs. He's had some health issues as well that has limited his availability; however, I'm mostly ok with this as I expected it and up until the past year I've been able to get attention when I need it. 

Last spring, at a conference, I ended up getting a very nasty voicemail after a day of bad cell signal resulted in missed calls. We had a few hours before the poster session/social and were talking at the hotel with some beers. He called while we were wrapping up and heading over, but we were running 5-10 minutes late. The voicemail attacked my character as an individual, criticized my leadership, and highlighted my failures over the past year along with noting a change in my behavior (I'd been on medication a few months at this point). The next day, all seemed well with him. He complimented my talk, and so I let it go as I suspected he might not have been all together that night. Things have been distant ever since, not strained... we just haven't seen each other and the interactions we have had have been short, almost curt. 

Fast-forward to this semester. We set up my written exams last month and I emailed all my committee members individually to ask them if they were ok with the date and me taking them from home. I also asked for guidance on what to focus on. I did not cc my advisor, I just sent him an email later saying everyone confirmed and we were good to go. Yesterday, I was emailing back and forth, talking about comps and he sent one asking if I had asked my committee what they would focus on, said he suspected I hadn't, and requested I CC him. I replied I had last month, gave him a summary, then compiled another email with all of theirs copy/pasted. This upset him, and I'm now on my own for coordinating my comps. I sent him a quick reply, apologized and explained why I did what I did... but have not heard back since.  
  
I get the feeling I've worn out my welcome in the lab, and I'm feeling a little like Milton in Office Space. I'm not sure if it's been the stress of last semester, or trying to work alone out here, but I find myself laying awake at night wondering if it's really worth it. I think of calling quits, taking time off, I dono. I'm at this threshold, I'm almost tempted to call them off, take a leave of absence or try to find another program locally... I don't want to loose the last 4 years though, and I feel if I don't finish this what adviser would take me in the future if a year or so from now I want to try again?  
  
EDIT/Response: Thank you for the advice. I feel ridiculous getting so worked up... but I'm exhausted. I will say, this is the halfway point, not the end. I still have the bulk of my research to do, or all the data analysis since the data is collected. I expect another 2 years before I get my dissertation approved.",9,2013-10-23 07:12:50

I am planning on doing a Masters before searching for employment. 

The problem is I never much liked Economics even though I am quite good at it. I always wanted to be an Engineer since I liked to tinker around and ""invent"" or build gadgets, particularly mechanical ones. Infact, I started college in Electrical and Electronic Engineering and dropped in the 4th month to Economics due to the maths-intensive nature of it. 

To me Economics seems mainly philosophical and less practical. The sheer number of maths and theories boggle my mind and when I am writing on it or doing the research I find that my eyes develop black circles out of boredom and depression. 

Yet, despite all these, I have already invested, money, time, energy and effort into Economics and changing subjects now would be like drowning the ship near the port. 

So what should I do? Should I do a masters in Economics, or some other subjects?? I would be glad to hear all of your opinions. ",0,2013-11-13 06:55:16
1q08yb,NotAnInstructor,t2_dsm7i,"Unofficial Instructor - feeling lost, confused, like I did something wrong. [cross-post with r/GradSchool]","I need anyone to talk to right now. I'm not sure what's going on but I feel like I've done something wrong or bad or incorrect.

I am a second year graduate student in a doctoral program. Last year, my first year as a grad student and at my institution, I was a TA for a new professor and we bonded very quickly. She became pregnant at the end of the academic year and I taught a few of her lectures when she had medical complications from the pregnancies. This year, before the semester began, she asked if I would cover the last week of lecture and the final exam (her due date was just after Thanksgiving). My understanding and what we discussed was that a senior professor (one who she doesn't share instructing philosophies with) would cover for her if she went into labor a bit early.

The problem begins with the fact that she began having medical complications again at the very end of September and would ask me to lecture about a day before class started. In total, I taught 4 out of the past five weeks (she was able to lecture one week in the middle). Last week I was informed that she had gone into labor approximately 5 weeks early and to cover the rest of the semester. All during this time we had been communicating one-on-one and I assumed she was speaking with her bosses. I had the vague feeling that the chairs knew of the situation but just let me continue since I was the only one to cover (the actual TA has a very, very poor grasp of the material). Prior to my mentor teaching this course, there was no true ""instructor"" and just a series of inefficient post-docs. I also didn't want to bring attention to the fact that my mentor and friend might not be 100% on top of a very new, career-making second year. 


Well...apparently no one of importance actually realized my mentor was permanently out for the semester. Now I have a bunch of people (chairs of departments, senior professors, my research advisor) all emailing me saying the exact same thing: ""I was just informed of this...we need to talk ASAP...are you okay...""   My advisor has assured me I haven't done anything wrong...but now I feel like I have?  It's like suddenly me commenting ""guess I'm teaching today!"" or ""Lecture went really well today!"" completely blew over everyone's heads until suddenly someone connected the dots and *fuck we have a second year teaching a sophomore lecture*.  And I feel like me asking for help, asking to have someone take over for me, is slightly betraying my mentor and casting her in a bad light and *oh jeeze I just feel guilty and don't know why*.

Side note: I've also in this time been on the edge of mental breakdowns, had to drop two of my three classes due to poor grades (inability to do crap-all), have sought counseling for anxiety and depression issues, and have started an antidepressant. None of which any of my department knows about.


TL;DR: I just need to talk to anyone.

1uifrl,TazedSoul,t2_6pqax,Thoughts on my personal essay for an undergraduate research program?,"I am about to apply to a two-year undergraduate research program that provides a stipend and lab position. Part of the application process requires an essay. I don't have much experience writing these kinds of essays, so I would appreciate any feedback anyone has for me.



This is the prompt: 



 ""Please tell us the relevant courses you have taken, the type of course work you plan to take to prepare yourself for a career in research, and why research in the biomedical sciences is important to you. Your career goals should also be clear as well as your reasons for wanting to join this program abs what you believe you night contribute to the goals of it.""

The maximum number of words is 1000, which is exactly how long my essay is.



Here is my essay:



When I enrolled as a community college student, I told myself I would only transfer to a university if I fell in love with a career path that required a university education. As a student without financial support from my family, I knew that I would have to work to put myself through college, and that I would rely on the generosity of government grants, scholarships, and student loans to finance my education. I knew from the start that it would be a waste of all financial assistance I received, as well as my own time, if I did not have a good reason for attending university.  



I concluded a desire to spend my time in something I truly enjoy, for I do not see lasting fulfillment coming from working for the sole reward of money. I asked myself, if I didn't have to ""make a living,"" what would I do each day? My answer was immediate: I would learn everything I could about the subjects that interest me and share my findings with others. I realized I want to be a college professor. But what would I study? I was interested in psychology at the time, but as I continued to study the discipline, I became absorbed by the brain itself. During my time at XXXX, I have continued to narrow my interest to neuroscience of medical issues. By studying the brain, I can play a meaningful role in society by helping people who suffer where science's understanding rests incomplete.  After considerable research and discussion with my mentors, I changed my major to biology. I believed this would best prepare me to enter a neuroscience PhD program directly after my undergraduate degree. I determined that a strong foundation in the sciences that elucidate neuroscience, such as biology, chemistry, and physics, is paramount.  



At the core of my decision to major in biology is the perspective that my coursework is a purposeful training for my future as a researcher, which will enable me to someday make significant contributions to my field. Much of my coursework has already done this. Biology of the Cell and Fundamentals of General Chemistry provided the foundation for my further education in both of these core disciplines. In General Psychology, I began to see the brain as the source from which our experience as human beings arises. In Biological Psychology, I was introduced to some of the underlying biological mechanisms of the brain. This class inspired me, sparking my curiosity in the brain. In Experimental Psychology, I was introduced to the world of experiment and research. College Statistics provided an essential foundation in statistical analysis, an essential tool for any researcher.  Similarly, I my enjoyment and success in English Composition classes will help me as a researcher. After all, it is through writing -- and ultimately publication -- that professors reach the widest audience.  



My future coursework will continue to prepare me for research. Biology courses, including Neurobiology, Biology of Organisms, Biology of Populations, Cell Physiology, Molecular Biology, and Genetics, will provide the information necessary for understanding the brain in the context of the biological organism it drives. Further, I believe I require a strong understanding of chemistry, as biology is the sum of chemical interactions. Therefore I will take a year of General Chemistry and Organic Chemistry, as well as a course in Biochemistry. This same logic gives rise to my interest in physics coursework. The laws of physics lead to those of chemistry and biology, and thus a year of Physics will prove important.



The other component of my training as a future scientist is research. Thus far, I have participated in a summer research program at XXXXX, during which I worked full-time in XXXX's lab, studying the neurobiology of mice selectively bred for voluntary high wheel-running. I developed a project under the supervision of a graduate student who was underway sectioning and analyzing brain regions. I became curious about the mechanisms that contribute to the mice's ability to run three-fold more than control mice. I examined the periaqueductal gray, a midbrain landscape implicated in the mediation of both ascending and descending nociceptive pathways. Given the relationship between exercise and pain, I wondered if the mice had structural differences in brain regions involved in pain. Previous research showed the mice possessed larger midbrains, so I determined this area warranted closer inspection. My project required employing a Nissl-staining protocol to identify the nuclei of the tissue. Using microscopy, I captured photographs of the sections. With the guide of a brain atlas, I delineated the periaqueductal gray using software. We then analyzed for differences in neuronal density and area. I wrote a paper on the project, as well as presented a poster at XXXX's student symposium. Over winter break, I have continued to volunteer in this lab.



If accepted to XXXX, I would like to work with one of the following professors: Dr. X, who studies synapses and neurotransmitters; Dr. X, who investigates the neurobiology of depression; or Dr. C, who examines the effects of drugs on the brain. Of course, given the integrative nature of neuroscience, the opportunity to work in any relevant lab would prove useful to a developing neuroscientist.



I feel that XXXXX would provide an invaluable opportunity to me as an aspiring college professor and researcher. I recently resigned from my part-time job, so that I can continue to be involved in research during my time as an undergraduate. If I am accepted, the opportunity would provide me the financial means to continue working on research, along with other resources, such as faculty mentoring, which I will need to be successful in my goal of acceptance into a neuroscience PhD program directly after my bachelor's degree.



I realize there are many applicants to this program, but in your decision, I hope you will consider me. This opportunity will help me accomplish what I want to do with my life.    



Sincerely,

1xai2a,shmayy,t2_f60zt,Any advice/experience when applying to graduate school with a criminal record?,"I was charged with my first DUI a week prior to turning 21 in September of 2012, although I was just now convicted [my case was originally dismissed due to police misplacing my blood test and then it miraculously resurfaced 7 months later] in August of 2013.  Speeding up to today, I've completed all the court requirements and am currently in my last semester of college with a goal of continuing onto a graduate program in I/O Psychology.  

On a personal level, I have been in therapy for months now attempting to overcome my severe anxiety, depression, and utter shame I carry with me on the daily.  Despite my mental state, this experience has lit a smoldering fire under my ass kicking my motivation into high gear.  I've since excelled in my academics, completed an internship, and will hopefully coauthor two studies come spring if all goes accordingly - but that's neither here nor there. I apologize for the tangent, it's a pathetic attempt to rectify my self image.

Revolving back to the sole purpose of this post: I am simply unhinged at the thought of my application being denied from every program I apply to over my DUI. I would sincerely appreciate any words of wisdom and/or stories from those undergoing or who have undergone a similar situation. 

Thanks everyone for your time.

I am in field of CS and i am an international student .My MS was completed in DEC ,but my advisor could not find good CS students to work on her projects so she promised to help me find a job if i stayed back and helped her with her projects .I did .


*( I am an international student and i need to get a full time job by APR ,otherwise i have to leave country and this is my second masters.I brought this to my advisors attention and she said she understands that)*

3 Weeks ago , i asked her if it was possible to do a PHD with her. She said she has to look into fundung and get back to me. So we met last friday and she told me she has no funding and her contacts did not show any interest in my profile. So she  asked me to find a job myself and move on. She advised me to apply for some companies but she said she doesnt know anybody there , which is a big lie because i know her close friends work there.

I finally broke down in my lab.I stayed  back for her but she is deserting her student of 2 years who did thesis under her at most important time of his life. 

Another professor in my Dept. does Operations Research and he knew i am good in CS ,so during a talk last month he had offered me PHD( i mentioned this to my advisor and she said not to join his lab and said they do crap research) . So last friday after meeting with my advisor , in heat of the moment i went into his office and asked him he was still interested. He said yes ,and he contacted my advisor if she was ok with it and started working on the application.

I came to know through him that all non tenured professors(my advisor) have their first year PHD students expenses supported by grad school . So she lied to me that she doesnt has funding.

When she came to know that i am going to work with him , she has stopped responding to my emails since Friday noon. I have asked her for chat but there is no single reply.She did reply to the other guy in lab this weekend.

Honestly ,i am not interested in Operations Research and i was kind of  angry with my advisor so i asked the other professor to start PHD process. Over the weekend , i thought for long and have come to conclusion tha5t i have no interest in his subject and i will tell him  that tomorrow before he dispatches my application to graduate school.

What should i do right now?Should i tell my advisor sorry? She betrayed me and she is not talking to me as if she feels betrayed .I dont want to join other professor just to maintain my status in US . I am genuinely interested in her research but i dont know what do at his point ,its a mess involving 2 professors.

*UPDATE : The grad students in other prof's lab had told me earlier he had denied PHD to two other students last week earlier in belief that i will somehow join his lab . I didnt want to join him ,leave in betwen and jeopardize his research. It will be very difficult for me to work on something i am not motivated on for 4 years.I met with my advisor again and this time she said i dont deserve a PHD. Ironic part is she herself was an international student during 2001 and she didnt get a job due to market depression 9/11 and a professor offered her PHD then. Amazing how people change. I know i am screwed now but i just hope i get a job somehow.*

At the moment I'm half a master thesis away from becoming a Msc in mathematics, with a specialty in probability theory &amp; statistics.

I would join a psychiatrics department and use new, fancy statistical models to model depression-related diseases (that's all I know at the moment, really). I was surprised by this proposal, since I never considered myself PhD-material. I quite like the idea of applying mathematical knowledge to 'real life problems', but I don't know if I am up to the task and I can't decide what to do.

Is there any reason, outside of academia, for a math dude with knowledge of mathematical statistics to obtain a PhD? Will it help me in finding better jobs afterwards? Are there people here who are in a similar situation, and what did you decide?

wysfl,glitterati_gal,t2_5u439,Need help to get my career back on track after some personal tragedies.,"Hello.  I'm a postdoc in biomedical science who just spent a year, more or less, out of commission scientifically due to a bit of a personal shit storm.  

I am an only child of divorced parents and my mother, father, and I all became seriously ill at the same time.  Now things have mostly settled down: my mother passes away, I have had the surgery I need (very early stage cancer, they think they got everything with the surgery, scheduled for follow-up in about 6 weeks), and I managed to hire someone to look after my dad part time.  I'm back at work full time after all this time of functioning at a pretty low-level. In addition to my postdoc research, I am still finishing my big paper from my dissertation and now I find it is imminent that I will be scooped by a big genome paper from one of the big institutes.

I am trying to do my postdoc work during the day and my personal paper at night and on the weekends.  But I have to admit, I just don't have the physical and emotional energy for this schedule.  When I get home from 8 hours of work, I just want to curl up on the couch, eat a nice hot dinner, and watch old episodes of Star Trek. By the weekends, I am completely spent.  Of course, I force myself to work, but I am easily distracted and find it difficult to focus.  I feel so anxious about getting scooped and am already a little depressed about everything that has happened this year, which doesn't help this focus problem.  I tried to get some counseling, but I live and work way out in the suburbs and I found that I'd rather use the 3.5 hours a weeks I was using on that (2.5 hour commute plus 1 hour session) for work.  Plus, the counseling was less than helpful.

My boss has been pretty patient with me dealing with my personal stuff, but I would not say he is pleased that he is seeing so little production out of me (even now, I working 40 hours is a week is only a bit more than half the time the other postdocs put in).  I don't think a request for more time off will workout so well.

Any advice on how I can refocus, even just for a few weeks, to get this paper out?

TL;DR - Family and personal illness took me out of the loop for a year, back to find out my dissertation with get scooped if I don't get my paper out ASAP.  I don't have the luxury of time to get over everything that has happened, but my brain rebels when I tell it to get back to working the 70 hour weeks it needs to so my career can get back on track.

zuhtw,ceramicfiver,t2_4ncbz,"Do you know of any colleges or universities that do not use Internet, or would accommodate a student that does not want to use Internet?

","I ask you this because I suffer immensely from Internet addiction. I have wasted countless of hours online, spent days on end in my dorm room doing nothing but surfing the Internet and eating granola bars for meals. I've ruined friendships because I spent more time online than I did with friends. It has torn apart my sleep schedule, diet, and general health. I've sunk into depression and anxiety attacks correlated with Internet addiction so many times.

I just got my AA degree Summer '11 and after a year break of school, I came back this Fall to finish my BS degree. However, I'm already back to old habits that I simply cannot destroy. Even though I did not bring a computer with me to school, the library's computers suck me in. It's hard to escape when professors require you to go online.

I've been to several therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists, and even Sex Addicts Anonymous for porn addiction, but I at this point I want to run away from the Internet all together.

I've already spent over $200 thousand on college so far, most of that going down the drain due to spending days online instead of going to class.

*Do not* try to give me therapy. That's not why I'm here.

*Do not* chastise me for the hypocrisy of using the Internet to ask this question.

I am simply asking if you know of a school that would fulfill my desires. I much prefer an entire community of people that abstain from Internet, as the support of a community can have invaluable benefits. I'm aware that if a ""non-Internet"" college exists it is likely to be religious. I prefer that it is not, but I may just go there for the ""non-Internet"" factor.

I've never been completely decided on what my major is. I've switched from psychology, to anthropology, to philosophy, and all over. I'm currently a physics major, but I would definitely switch if it would help curtail my Internet addiction in any way.

Thank you very much and I appreciate your time. Let me know if you have any questions.

zg9cs,ThatGrumpyGoat,t2_4mlga,Tell my grad school academic advisor about my depression?  It has delayed my work at least 2 months (and counting). Please advise.,"xpost from r/depression

TL;DR: Should I tell my generally-supportive academic advisor that my complete lack of productivity is due to depression? What have you (grad students) experienced in this situation?

Before July, I hadn't had a depressive episode since 2007. I'd convinced myself it would never happen again (haha).  I woke up one morning in July and spent the day in bed thinking suicidal thoughts. Guess I was wrong.

Since then, I have been physically-present but mentally-absent at work. I have maybe a week's worth of work to show for the past two months.
Today I woke up and cried all morning. Crying jags - and my lack of concentration at work - are new symptoms I haven't experienced in the past depressive episodes.  Previously, I was able to channel my feelings into academics.

This has stalled my PhD for months, but (stupidly) I've been trying to hide it. I can't even manage that anymore if I'm crying in lab.

So I'm looking for advice: Do I tell my PI? He has always been supportive and my position is contractually guaranteed. But I worry that I might be labeled as unreliable or that it might influence his recommendation letters down the road (whether consciously or not). What have you done in this situation and how has it worked out for you?

Thanks.

**EDIT: Thank you for all your feedback.**  After weighing what was said, I am planning to tell my PI.  Regarding specific worst-case concerns: I am already in therapy in my school health center and have a psychiatric consult for medication in the pipeline, so there is a paper trail and proof of a diagnosed illness if my advisor goes Mr. Hyde on me (I don't think he will).  It also allows me to demonstrate to him that I am being proactive about the situation and trying to get back on track.  He has been amazing for the past 5 years (and I've seen the fallout of friends' abusive advisors for comparison); I don't think he will let me down.

**EDIT REDUX:**  Everything went well in the short term.  PI was supportive and expressed willingness to help me get my project back on track.  Now to get some drugs and hopefully get a measure of my focus back.  Thanks again, redditors. :)",26,2012-09-06 14:52:17
10mdp6,tashibum,t2_3zu9y,I'm having a hard time my first semester at a University,"I want to start out by saying I'm not a bad student. I'm a transfer student, so I've done the college thing before, but I'm having a really hard time and I'm going to (probably) fail both of my 4 unit classes.

Close to the beginning of the semester, one of my best friends was killed. This effected me heavily for about a week, and my professors understood, so they let me hand in things a week late. However, that one week has set me behind a lot more than I expected. I feel completely lost when I go to class and at this point I'm just winging it. 

I went to go see a counselor. It was nice to get stuff off my chest, but the most guidance he had for me was...well nothing. It was all ""how does that make you feel?"" things that he said. I have no idea how I'm supposed to cope with the sudden loss. About once a week it hits me all over again and for the rest of the day I go into a bad depression and I don't care about school anymore, which sets me back even more, but it's ok in my head because I'm already behind. 

Then last week I got really sick and had to miss a few more days, and still come in to take a midterm (which I failed, but at least I'm trying?).  I'm not really sure what to do. There doesn't seem to be any kind of help for this kind of thing on campus. I can't go to my prof's office hours because it conflicts with other classes. I can't afford a tutor. I can't drop out or I have to pay back my financial aid. I don't want to fail my important classes, but I guess the best I can do is try again next semester and be on financial probation and hope for the best.

15z6iu,unistudent11,t2_a3sge,Failed two course- Help/Advice Needed Please ,"Hi, 

I'm third year mechanical engineering student. My results just came yesterday and I learned I've failed two of my engineering courses. I'm very shocked right now. I've unbearable headache. I just took tylenol to ease of the pain. 
I had been severely depressed in the beginning of the term and I was unable to concetrate on study. As I had failed mid term for both of this courses, I was determined to work harder to pass the course. 


So for this course Kinematics, I had roughly 33 points out of 50. Final was for 50 percentages. My prof had put the condition in the lecture notes (not in outline) that one had to pass the final in order to pass the course. I did alright in the final. I thought I could get minimum 40-50 percentage in the final. I only needed to 17 points in the final to pass the course if you rule out the condition. I have emailed my prof to see my exam. Classes starts monday and I don't have much time now. I'd not be able to take 4 courses in next term as these two courses are prerequisite.


Second course controls, I had roughly 32/33 points out of 63 before final and I needed ~17 - 18 out of 37 points, which means I needed minimum 50 in the final exam to pass the course. I was very confident about this exams. I had prepared well. I was confident to get ~60 points in the final. And I don't know what happened now. Also, just day before my marks were delivered, our marksheet on blackboard disappeared for this course and I still had 6% of class material to be graded/uploaded on blackboard. This was last assignment and lab. I don't know if I actually received mark for this. 


I'd not like to blame my profs for this even though I barely learned anything in the class. I'd not like to use this as excuse either. If prof isn't great in delivering material, I'd study everything from the textbook. I did the same this time and I was confident about material for controls exams especially. 
I'd very much appreciate your help. I've never failed before. I've always received B's and occasional As in my engineering courses. I take full responsibility of my actions. I only wanted to pass these courses and start fresh next term. I was also dealing better with my depression and feeling better in general. I don't know what happened. I'm so much stressed. ;( ",3,2013-01-04 23:16:50
16xwc9,bearsito,t2_712gz,Profs only advice please: Dept &amp; College politics,"I'm an Assoc Prof. Due to attrition, retirements &amp; layoffs, it turns out I'm now the highest ranking full time faculty member in our dept. The dept is currently headed by a couple of semi-retired full profs. The acting chair is not a scholar, has never pursued research and publishing, but instead has built their career being an autocratic 'strong man' for administrators, appointed to chair departments whenever a dean wanted to create 'efficiencies' etc. (you know what that means I'm sure). The chair was appointed to our dept by the dean, then 'elected' in a process that would have outed anyone who didn't vote for them (everyone was pre-tenure at that time), and likes rewording history to ignore the reality of their installment over us. Both semi-retirees will be gone in 2 years, and in my assessment, the program is being left in a condition that might make sense to an administrator, but is, from my perspective, not reflecting the state of the art in the discipline, nor does it look sustainable to me from an administrative perspective without the combined knowledge of decades of administrative trickery that the current chair has. The problem is, as the ranking prof, I've said this and been ignored. I would be the next in line to chair the dept. but I seriously don't want anything to do with that job. The Jr. profs are pretty much towing the line for the current chair, and don't seem to realize those people aren't even going to be there when they're up for tenure. So, I'm thinking I have a few options: (1) Shut up and keep my head down, let the house of cards fall when the Emeriti finally leave, (2) get the hell out of Dodge asap, (3) seek to have my appointment moved to a different dept, (4) embrace the madness and throw myself into the fray of Dept. and College politics. The first option seems to hold the best promise for continuity in my research and writing, the second is appealing only if I can get to a better institution in as good or better an urban area (I'm a city person, which is in large part why I've stayed this long), the third might just invite all the same shit in a different pile, the fourth will undoubtedly result in an increase in my dosage of anti-depression meds. Any advice would be welcomed. Am I overlooking anything? Is it the same everywhere? I really wanted to be an academic so I could practice scholarship, but all this shit is getting in the way of that, and that's what I need to be able to do to be happy.

jhy50,phuketawl,t2_5gkwd,How the hell is my GPA so high and my GRE score so low?,"I am a UC Berkeley psychology undergrad **looking to do a PhD** in Psychology, Sociology, or Social Welfare (most likely social welfare). I'm a bit of a non-traditional student having taken 2 years off between high school and college, going to community college for my lower division/general education stuff and transferred to Cal. I had a 3.95 at my community college and have a **3.96 at Cal** after my first year (I still have this year to go before I know what my total GPA is). 4.0 overall in my major thus far.

I **started studying for the GRE at the beginning of Summer**, knowing that I'd have to put significant time into studying for the quantitative section since I've never been really confident in math. Plus, I never took geometry (kind of fucked off in high school), let alone trig or calc. All I needed was stats to transfer, and I got As in both of the stats classes that I've had to take. Everyone kept saying ""You dont need to study for 3 months for the GRE...just do a little review and take some practice tests, with such a high GPA you should be fine."" Well, even **after studying pretty intensely for a couple of months**, hiring a math tutor and everything, I'm only scoring in the **~30th percentile in quantitative and ~60th percentile in verbal on my practice exams.**

As you can imagine, I'm feeling incredibly discouraged. Pair that with a bout of depression that I've started taking medicine for (and we all know how fun starting new psychiatric medicine is) for the first time in my life and I'm feeling like there's no hope for me at all. Part of this **looming depression is knowing that my undergraduate career is almost over and this has been the most (if not only) fulfilling (not necessarily fun) time of my life** and the thought of it ending makes me cringe and sob. I held onto the hopes that my graduate education would continue to fulfill my drive for knowledge exploration and contribution...but now with the scores I'm getting, I'm worried that the schools I want to go to (**I'm particular about what I'd like to study, so there are only like 2-3 schools I would consider going to**) wont take me because of these low scores. Thus, spiraling me deeper into this sense of loss and depression, further lowering my confidence and, by continuation, my scores. 

I am **scheduled to take the official GRE in 10 days and am considering *not* **because I don't to embarrass myself with such low scores. Plus, I hear they average scores together if its taken multiple times, and that the GRE scores are the highest predictor of funding. However, I already paid the $80 non-refundable (discounted by 50% only once) **fee that I really can't afford**, let alone paying another $160 to reschedule it.

lkmge,[deleted],,Is there a point in staying?,"This is going to seem a bit long, there's a tl;dr version at the end if you can't bear reading this. Anyways, I've been attending university in Canada for the past three years. My first year I was in biochemistry; after battling extreme illness due to the onset of Celiac disease and a harsh breakup, my marks went to crap and I was forced to drop out or change programs. (I've also never failed anything in my life. Was hard to swallow.)

Second year I tried to commit suicide twice and was diagnosed with bipolar I during the following summer. My marks were fairly good, and I was accepted into Honors Psychology. The following year was alright, but as I was just beginning medication regimens and really a lot of issues regarding my diagnosis including extreme depression, my marks weren't great. I was put on conditional standing.

Then I took statistics and, where the class average was only about 60%, I got 55%. My average flatlined in my psychology courses and I was dropped into a 3-year general degree.

I'm now at the point where I want to give up. I'm in my 'third' year of my program, my marks are up, I'm on medication, I'm getting research experience, but I've realized it'll all be for nothing: I can't possibly get back into Honors. I would need to get over 88% in at least 5 psychology courses to make the 75% cutoff.

Without honors, I can't take advanced stats, take seminars or do a thesis. Without those, I'm reasonably positive no grad school in the country would take me. This SUCKS because the schools themselves say they look at your last 2 years of performance. If this year and next year are spectacular, it won't matter. I won't have stats or the 'required experience' because I CAN'T.

So what the hell am I supposed to do? I don't think I can talk my way out of my position, but I really, desperately wanted to get at least my Master's. If I can't do that, I feel like a failure. I don't even think I could beg my way into at least having the option of taking those courses without being in the 'honors' reserve portion because no one sympathizes and I hate making excuses for my poor performance.

My other possibilities are getting my B.Ed (worthless in Ontario, no jobs, would have to move) or my ECE (lots of jobs, make no money). I'm specializing in child development, if anyone finds that relevant. The practical part of me is willing to do any job that will make me more than $30,000 a year. The passionate part of me wants to get my PhD and go into developmental research or clinical counseling so bad it hurts.

tl;dr: I'm academically screwed out of getting my PhD. What else can I do to help kids with a B.A. in General Psychology that'll actually pay the bills? (Or better, how can I prove to an admissions board that I AM Ph.D material, despite not having completed a thesis?)

mvsd4,EvolvedIt,t2_6cjf3,Advise on switching advisors?,"Hi guys,
I'm a second year evolutionary biology PhD student, and I was wondering if anyone has switched advisors before and has any tips.

I was accepted as a PhD student in my biology program by a professor I hadn't applied to whose primary research interests were pretty divergent from mine, but she said she'd like to get involved with what I stated my research interests are in application. This was my only acceptance, so I took a risk and accepted the offer of admission.

My first interviews with her and every conversation I had with her through about my first semester and a half felt like trying to take a drink from a fire hose. She was clearly very excited to have me, but she didn't take the time to find out what I was interested in. I ended up getting handed a project. The question was okay, but I didn't like the study system, and I was sent to another professor's lab to learn the lab techniques from one of his grad student. The project was supposed to take around two months, but it has dragged on for 9 months and still isn't close to being finished.

I had a committee meeting last week, and I spent the week and a half before it having no idea what to say. I had very little data to show for my work and was not happy with my situation, but I couldn't figure out how to put in to words what specifically I was unhappy about. Literally the day before my meeting, it occured to me that I should stop focusing on what I don't want to do and start focusing on what I do want to do.

So I whipped up a really loose proposal on a system I've been really interested in for the last year with about 12 questions I'd be interested in looking at. I'm pretty sure my committee thought I was crazy, but they were supportive and gave me the names of several people in the department who might be able to help me with this project. My current advisor is resigning from that position.

The other issue I have is that I performed poorly last year. Besides the normal stresses of you first year in graduate school and the anxiety of feeling steam-rolled by my advisor, I was having health issues. I would have a few days of debilitating anxiety or depression that made me completely unable to focus, as well as day-long migraine headaches. The drugs I was prescribed actually worsened my symptoms. Naturally this also increased my academic-related stress, and it wasn't until the summer that I could slow down enough to figure out what issues were drug- or health-related and what was just stress-related. By mid-summer, I had my drugs sorted out and I am back to my positive and stable self.

Sorry this got kind of long.

I'm 21, currently working full time as a welder (night shift sucks) saving money and paying off any debts I have (I'll be out of debt completely within 3 months). I tried going to decently large university in my hometown (13,000 students) twice after graduating high school. Started in fall of '09 as a Computer Science major, dropped out at semester due to struggles with depression, started again in fall of '10, this time dropping out at semester again because I figured out that the school was simply a bad fit for me.

So for the last year I've been working full time, living on my own, and until 3 months ago, barely scraping by. I've done a lot of soul searching in the years since I graduated high school and being on my own and working has let me truly evaluate myself. 

I'm an intelligent person, although I have been wasting my talents on video games for a long time, something I feel many in my generation are apt to do. But I've had enough of it. My mind aches for challenges that simply playing games cannot satisfy anymore. Also, I can't live with myself knowing that I could be contributing to science and humanity if I just had more education. 

I have begun warming up by brain for learning in the last few months by starting to read again (something I did a lot when I was younger but dwindled during high school), brushing up on math (using Khan Academy; currently working on pre calc exercises), and using reddit as a means to find interesting things to learn about such as robotics, space, technology and the like. I'd like to go to school for robotics of some sort, as I like to work with my hands building things, but also enjoy programming and designing things. 

My question is, how do I go about getting back into school? My transcript is dismal at best due to dropping out twice. I assume any financing would be primarily out of pocket. I would like to get back into school sometime in the next 3 or 4 years, though obviously, the sooner the better. Where do I start?

So, because I burned so badly and pulled myself from a 3.5 to a 2.9 over the last two semesters, I need some help pulling that back up while I'm still in the middle of an intense engineering program.  I'm most interested in supplemental reading for chemistry and physics - tutorials etc. and books (I have some money to get a book or two) - because I haven't taken chemistry in six years and don't remember a damn thing, and I've never taken a proper physics course.

For discrete math, I have copies of How to Prove It (forgot the author) and Schaum's Outline, which were the required material when I crashed, burned, and utterly failed the class because I decided to take it under the university's most demanding professor (sucks to be me, but I still learned a hell of a lot).  For calculus, I have [The Manga Guide to Calculus](http://nostarch.com/mg_calculus.htm), which while basic did help me my first third-around with calc I (I passed it with an A first time, that didn't transfer, second time I missed a mid term thanks to a terrible car accident, and third time I managed to pass.  yay!)  So I'm open to suggestions for those as well.

Other things I'm doing on the side are following [this tutorial about electronics](http://electronicstheory.com/COURSES/ELECTRONICS/e101-6.htm) which seems to have some chemistry involved, but that's mostly because I'm curious.

**tl;dr:**  Any suggestions for supplemental reading that is entertaining and in ""layman's terms"" for basic chemistry and mechanical physics?

[edit] So I did want to note about why the crash in GPA:  basically, I'm having a really shitty time.  Life happened - had a major illness last fall that caused me to miss nearly a month of school, the following semester my car got hit by someone running a stop sign, and then this semester I'm going through a divorce, money issues, and the whole nine yards.

n8ebv,phdisappoint,t2_6ezt6,No publications = no prospects?,"Dear r/AskAcademia,

I'm a recently-graduated Ph.D. student (in the hard sciences) who has a few questions regarding the world of academia and job prospects, and I'd love to get some perspectives from those who have been in the game for a while.

Essentially my problem boils down to this: I have no publications and have been to no conferences, and these seem to be essential to get a job and move up the ladder in academia. This situation has come about partly due to the nature of my Ph.D. (it was co-funded by an external partner and thus IP came into it), and partly due to, well, a less-than-encouraging supervisor. So as soon as I see the request for 'a list of publications' in a position advert, I get very down about my prospects.

If I'm honest, I must admit that I'm not particularly enamoured with the academic system on the whole, as it doesn't seem to offer a whole lot of security. Speaking anecdotally, even good researchers within my group that have proven track records had a lot of trouble obtaining grants to start doing their own research. Fashion within science has played a part in the unemployment of at least one researcher I know, and university budget restrictions another. So how the heck do I expect to get constant work when I'm (seemingly) way behind the eight ball already? I know that independent research centres are an option, but they seem to be still reeling a bit from the GFC and recent worldwide economic changes (and since research is by its nature speculative, it seems to me that few are offering positions until they can be assured of work coming in from industry/commercial sectors). I'm at a bit of a loss about where exactly to look, as my training has been so specific I feel that university or university-associated centres are my only choice.

I admit that this sense of despair could all be a kind of post Ph.D. depression, but when the motto of every university academic is 'publish or perish', I think there's a basis in reality for it. I'd love to hear any advice or your stories in how you went about getting into a job that's within your field, or perhaps any steps sideways you might have taken?

**tl;dr** I am a recently graduated Ph.D student with no publications/conference attendances, am I screwed?

UPDATE: So I've since had a chat to my supervisor/s and we're going to work on a couple of papers over the new year. We've also been in contact with the external partner and they've given us some guidelines for what we can and can't talk about in our reports. Hopefully between this and a good cover letter explaining the delay I'll be able to round out my resume. Thanks so much to everyone for their advice and support. (:",14,2011-12-11 11:20:52
oyb62,punk-geek,t2_6jr3e,"First semester was a disaster. What do I need to do, over the next 7 semesters, to get into grad school. ","I want to get into a grad school, and I know that 2nd semester freshman year is going to be the time when I need to figure out a plan to get from undergrad to grad. I have no clue what the plan should be. 

Last semester was a perfect storm of depression and homesickness until late November when I pulled myself together and managed to pass, and barely keep my scholarships. 

So I guess I am looking for general advice, there is a lot online but it seems rather empty and vague. What do I need to do to get into academia and what do I need to avoid? ",0,2012-01-26 23:31:03
