After being a grad student and a postdoc for several years, I developed severe mental health issues (after being completely healthy in my youth, as far as I can tell).

My friends (around eight people who I knew well) who were graduate students or postdocs at the same time have experienced terrible mental health problems/breakdowns (such as bipolar disorder, psychosis, suicidal tendencies, needing to take a year off work, being placed into a mental hospital for some time, forgetting to eat).

Three other grad students I knew developed severe illnesses (unknown physical illnesses for two of them and an instance of extreme anxiety for the third one) that are not compatible with working and they have been unemployed since then.

A professor and another postdoc I met can only function when they are taking heavy doses of antidepressants (the professor in fact tends to experience prolonged periods of time when he is not able to function at all). As far as I know, all these people developed their mental health problems after being in academia for some time. In addition to these, I have heard many more people in academia talking non-specifically about often going through periods of depression, which is frequently accompanied by inability to work.

I am wondering what can be done to improve this situation.

Should there be more research into mental health in academia, especially among grad students and postdocs?

Should there be more preventative measures that can ensure better coping of junior academics with mental health difficulties that are likely to befall them? (During my years in academia, I received virtually no specific information or training that could help me to prevent mental health problems).",academia,What can be done to improve mental health in academia: more research into mental health of academics or better preventative measures?
anxiousphdstudent,t2_74mxmoyr,2020-07-02 01:44:46,hjo01a,1,"My lab has a history of abusing people, but I thought my PI learned to be more understanding since my last mental breakdown. 3 years ago, I cried and broke down during a meeting after getting yelled out for taking a weekend off to visit my family and friends. PI accused me of not showing enough passion for science and letting them down for not being in lab during a freaking weekend, though it was after weeks of 60+hr work. It was pretty bad considering I went into lab at 4am to finish the work. I considered transferring labs then. People did warn me PIs don't change. But there were more open conversations about depression and overworking. So I stayed since I liked the research I was doing. 

Now, I kind of regret it. Since labs are reopening under restrictions, my lab has been trying to get everyone in lab to work 5-7 days a week. My lab never truly shut down, and was operating at 40% during lockdown. Now we are at 90% with working shifts and weekends even though my state still gets 200+ covid19 cases per day and masks are recommending but not mandatory. I'm scared and anxious to leave my apt everyday. But now, I'm more like maybe I should just get covid19 so I can stop being scared and anxious going out everyday and my PI can realize that we are still in the middle of a pandemic. My PI doesn't have to leave his house for months since he doesn't do bench work anymore. I feel like he is forgetting that leaving his house and commuting to work everyday increases risk of exposure. 

Some PIs just value what you can produce, they don't give a shit about mental health. They can say things, but don't really mean it. Funny thing is we only have international post docs since ""they work harder without much complaint"". Lol. They complain in Chinese and behind your backs. We lost 2 postdocs during the last 4 months of pandemic (moved back to home country since other countries were safer and closer to family). Won't be surprised if we lose more in next 3 months, and with visa ban, it will be hard for hiring.",academia,Why cant PIs change their abusive behavior?
hillywho,t2_3xmy59i4,2020-06-11 03:54:07,h0rj9t,1,"Hello everyone,

I needed some help with an academic petition I am filing which involves failed grades from my transcript. I just wanted to know if this is convincing enough. Any suggestions/comments would be helpful. As a context LWD means withdrawing from a course after dropout date has passed.


To the petitions committee at the University of xxxxx,

I am writing in the hope to remove/lwd from courses I took in the 2018-2019 school year; specifically MAT1xxY1, MAT2xxH1F &amp; Cxx1xxH1F. I acknowledge that after speaking with Academic Councillors, Social Workers &amp; Mathematical &amp; Computational Science adminstration LWDs are only granted before a student writes their final exam. However, due to impending severe mental health issues, internal family conflicts I was not in the correct state of mind to make a judgement call regarding my actions. My intention for this LWD is to address the fact that these grades from the 2018-2019 school year do not reflect my academic capabilities, and as such are impacting my CGPA and entry into the Applied Statistics Major. 

It's been a year since I filed my petition to lift my academic suspension where I mentioned the root cause of my downfall. I was facing depression, anxiety, insomnia as well as some sort of attention disorder problems since late winter (October) 2018. For the 2017-2019 academic years, I was living with my mother who has a severe form of paranoid schizophrenia. In addition to having to handle her other paranoid delusions, my mother frequently behaved the past academic year in a way that was detrimental to my learning and my ability to perform successfully in my courses, such as restricting my ability to attend evening lectures and confiscating my electronics, including my laptop on which I complete all of my assignments. The stress of having to live with and manage these behaviors caused my own mental health to suffer, and despite my best efforts, my performance in my classes was negatively affected. To be very specific being lost in thought for hours (remaining frozen/paralyzed), having sucidal thoughts, crying relentless for no given reason, battling insomnia due to lack of sleep (2 hours or less), etc. I tried to reach out to CAMH multiple times however, the sheer ignorance and lack of understanding about mental health and the stigma revolving around it bested me. My peers discouraged me from seeking help based on the fear of being arrested for having suicidal thoughts and that stuck with me for a long time. I was torn between moving out, making my academic life a priority and taking care of my mother. As a result, my mental health was severely affected and I was afraid of getting help from xxxx, CAMH or any of the department councillors. I didn't know what to do so I continued on with my courses regardless of knowing the circumstances up ahead. I was also under the impression that LWDs affect your GPA (according to my peers) and thats why I decided to continue taking my courses including my exam. If I had asked for help from Academic Councillors and talked about LWDs I would have used this option and not waste all of my credit no credits. 

Since January of 2019, I moved out and started subletting from friends in downtown Toronto. Like I mentioned earlier, I was so afraid of making mistakes in MAT1xx and Cxx1xx (requirements for Computer Science) that I would waste time on tests and exams by second guessing myself on simple questions rather than moving along confidently. I did decent in STA1xx despite this fact as the course had a lot of assignments, group discussions and topics that interested me. I was doing well in the course including the programming assignments and I had found a new interest in Statistics which carried on to some of my philosophy courses I picked such as PHL3xx and PHL3xx. I want to pursue statistics as I like my courses and I enjoy them, however because of my slip up in 2018-2019 school year, my CGPA is preventing me from enrolling in the major program as the requirements keep going up each year. I want to LWD/remove my failed courses in 2018-2019 as they don't reflect my academic capabilities. I have managed to bring up my GPA in philosophy courses that are Math/Stats/proof heavy and I really don't want to major in the humanities or any other program. I want to pursue this major and continue excelling in my academics and the only way to do is by removing my failed grades from the transcript.",academia,Need help with academic petition

rLouW,t2_o894fke,2020-04-06 17:49:51,fw3cj6,1,"Hello, I'm Louis.  I attend the University of Houston (in Texas) and I am completing the prerequisite courses this semester to start my master's degree.  A short history as to why I'm doing this... I have a decade and a half (outside of school) of having jobs that I've really liked but that have TERRIBLE job security (theater, biomedical research, etc.).  When I lost my most recent job, after some depression, soul searching and wanting something more stable in my life, I chose to pursue my master's degree.

The prerequisites are finished this semester, and now I am at the point of actually starting it in the Fall, but without being able to actually go to a counselor and talk to them, they aren't being very helpful (or maybe I'm not talking to the correct one).  They're just sending me to a link I've seen several times already.  My question is which track would be best to pick for me and for the real world considerations of getting and keeping a job.  I have four options:

1.  Core
2. Data Analytics
3. Parallel and Distributed Systems
4. Interactive Media

These are my thoughts on the matter so far:  The interactive media track seems weighted toward gaming design and things of that nature, which doesn't really fall under the stable category.  With my decade long background in biomedical research the Data Analytics may be a good option for me as far as ability to get a job when the degree is over.  The description for Parallel and Distributed Systems says ""emphasizes theory, design and evaluation of parallel computations, protocols, and vector and distributed data applications"", and I'm at a loss as to what those applications would be, so I'm not sure at all about this track.  And then I'm thinking that because of my indecisiveness, the Core track might be the best for me.

Thoughts?  Suggestions?  6 of 1 just pick one?  Thoughts on this from anyone who has this degree, is a computer science professor, or from the field would be greatly appreciated.  Perhaps I'll get in touch with a counselor who will actually assist me, but I'd rather not wait.",academia,"Difficult choosing a track for my Master's of Computer Science degree, counselors not helpful"

The issue is I'm struggling to begin my dissertation which is a literature review. I've already used 2 extensions (6 months each) due to my mental health, and I've only written 1000 words (out of 15000). Whenever I think about my upcoming deadline next month or sit down to start, I either have a panic attack or become overwhelmed and depressed.  

I've tried looking at guides on how to complete a lit review to dissertation standards - but I just can't get it into my head to even make a plan.  

I've been in touch with my lecturer about my issues, but after 15-16 months of having the dissertation assigned and I've only done 1000 words, there's only so much I'm willing to say. I'm also waiting to see a psychiatrist for my mental health.  

I don't even know what I'm asking for here, I think I've just hit rock bottom and I'm looking for any help or advice. Getting this off my chest could also be helpful.

askingquestionst,t2_6ig6n1ff,2020-08-07 15:01:22,i5fdbe,1,"Hello,

I am going to open my heart here because I have been having severe anxiety attacks and I don't know what to do.


I am an international student in Canada. My parents are sacrificing so much to pay international tuition + currency exchange rates to allow me to study my passion: Physics.

Since I am coming from the developing world, I thought that scientific careers were viable in developed countries. After 1 year in undergrad and contacting a lot of profs and PhDs as well as looking at numbers on the internet, I realized that I will not have the financial payoff once I graduate. While studying in here, I do not have money to see my family nor my friends, but I though this would change after I graduated.

Once I realized that Physics, specifically the area I wanted to work on (particle physics) has terrible, terrible job outlooks, I have been considering switching to Electrical Engineering to have a better life with less financial trouble. I would also be back at my home country to study this, so no financial burden on my parents and I would be able to see them maybe once a year.

But I am having such an identity crisis. All my life I wanted to be a scientist, to discover the secrets of the universe, to ask fundamental questions. After I realized that academia is idealised and a terrible career and decided to quit while I am still early in it, I started experiencing an identity crisis. I am afraid of being alone because I am afraid of my own thoughts, something that had never happened before. If it keeps up like this, I will end up in depression.

I am also afraid that I will regret my choice to quit, even though logically I know that if I don't quit I will regret it later. It feels like it does not matter what I choose, I will drown in regret.

I just wanted to know if other people had to go through this as well and how you managed to do it.",academia,Identity crisis by leaving Physics.

StevePoney,t2_5ls4u3tl,2020-07-21 16:08:20,hva49r,7,"Hey there, I'm looking for some advice or comments on my plan for PhD applications.

TL;DR: Student with strong academic/research background but quit halfway through previous PhD and completely burned bridges with advisor. No industry experience, only been in academia at 28: how much of a red flag is that to a new potential PhD advisor?

&amp;#x200B;

Long version:

I got 2 Master's Degree from my university in France (took extra classes to get the second one, in a related field). I then went for grad school in the USA, to work on something I was and am super excited about and in one of the best university the world. It went well for 1-1/2 year, but then my relationship with my advisor really deteriorated and it ended up pushing me slowly into depression, and eventually absolute inability to work for that person. When it became too much to handle, I quickly wrapped up a sandwich Master's Thesis after 3 years in that place. I left for what I thought would be a gap year, with the intent to come back fresh and working with a new advisor (my program allows that). Long story short, it did not and cannot happen for multiple reasons, and I'm just lucky I thought about submitting a thesis before leaving ""just in case"".

So I am 28 yo, i.e. 4-5 years older than a typical PhD applicant  in Europe, it looks like I am starting a collection of master's, but I still would like to pursue academic research and eventually get a PhD. I don't really feel like going through the whole US grad school admission process again to maybe start in September 2021 somewhere. I am starting to look in opportunities in Europe because this is where I am from, and also because I like the idea that in most places you know at least broadly what your PhD thesis will be about and long it will last: I feel like I should try to wrap that up quickly rather than spend 5 or more years in grad school.  I am particularly interested in Scandinavia, partly because of the social advantages and work culture there. One of my internship was in Stockholm and I really liked it. There it seems like a PhD application is like a typical job application, and if lucky I could start relatively soon.

I have 4 years of research experience: 2 x 6-month-long internships during my first masters, 3 years of grad school where classes seldom took a lot of my time. I have 6 publications, all in good journals and most as the first author; plus a few conference presentations. All of them are relevant to my field of study and what I want to do research on. Regarding classes, I have mediocre to good grades from my first master's, and a perfect GPA from the US.

I guess that's good, now the thing I am very worried about are recommendations:

* My prior advisor will not write me one. I applied a few months ago to something and my advisor never answered my emails or calls over the span of several months. I also know from some of their current students that they have been badmouthing me in very unprofessional terms, so it wouldn't be a good idea anyway.
* I could ask a professor from where I was in grad school and from which I took two classes (including final reports), and who knows of my research. He is famous and recognized in my field, but never did research with me.
* I could ask 2 advisors from old internships (professors in good universities), but 2015 is a long time ago and I don't know how well that would be seen. They wrote positive letters several years ago (I got into grad school), but I have not interacted with them since.
* Maybe I could also ask a professor with whom I interacted positively at conferences and who is a ""star"" in my field. He is a co-author of one of my latest paper (2018), but we never did research together and so I don't know if that would make sense (he was included in the article because he apparently discussed initial research ideas with my advisor, but we first talked only after the paper was accepted).

I am posting this to know how much a red flag all of this raises to potential advisors, and to have inputs on how I should answer questions about why I left grad school. I did not fail qualifying exams nor did I want to start working on something completely different: I actually want to study stuff very similar to what I have done in the past. I left because of some sort of burnout due to a crazy advisor, so ""personal reasons"" or ""relationship issues with advisor""  would be the truth, but is that enough? I don't think it would be appropriate to go into details as I don't want to appear bitter or childish towards my previous advisor.  What should I do if I am asked: ""could you ask \[old advisor\] to send us a recommendation letter?"" ? Any other  comments or tips or encouragements or whatever you feel may be useful are also welcomed.

&amp;#x200B;

PS: I don't want to get into the details here of my relationship with my prior advisor and of what went wrong. I know this could for instance mean that I am not ready to handle the stress or the workload a PhD; but I don't think so. I have zero doubt that this a a very toxic person and that I was not the issue. The experience of ALL the fellow students and postdocs I have worked with during my stay there comforts me in this idea. And I've always behaved very professionally, even after I left; so the petty behavior and lack of acknowledgement is uncalled for.",academia,PhD applications after quitting previous PhD

When I was in community college, I was working full time and going through some massive problems that were later diagnosed as clinical depression when I started at an actual university. With that, I was skipping classes all the time and at one point my academic performance was so poor my community college took my pelgrant from me. But after I got into university, my grades boosted massively. I graduated with a 3.64 from at the university (3.86 in my field), joined a lot of extracurriculars and presented at a couple of conferences and I am currently in my masters program at the same university. 

In my masters program, I have been given a grant to study abroad (but was made to return early due to the pandemic) and have taught for two semesters (I will have all the credits I need in three semesters). I have a 4.0 in my masters program thus far and I have some pretty good letters of recommendation, including from the head of graduate studies in my department, who told me when I first met her ""I'm warning you I don't write a letter of recommendation for just anyone"" but gave me an excited ""Yes!"" When I asked to write me one after my first year. 

So since leaving undergrad, I don't really want to brag but I do have a really good academic resume, but I'm still worried that the community college is going to haunt me applying for PhD. I had been told a long time ago by a former community college professor that the committees that decide graduate admission don't really care about classes at the 1-200 level but I'm still concerned.

Now I’m a teacher working full time and a half (meaning that I teach 18 lessons/36 hours per week and paperwork). The requirement is also to publish 2 articles per semester, but I simply cannot imagine how to do that. I have publications from the past, but I know that they are bad (they are published in low-quality journals without any reviews). The department where I work does almost no research except for this publications for the sake of publications. 

I know I need to find a research interest, but I don’t know how. Should I do Master’s in a better university for a sort of orientation? Or should I just try to apply for a PhD hoping that my excellent grades, experience in teaching and knowledge of languages (Russian, Tatar, Arabic, English, French, Polish and also a bit of Persian and Dutch) will work, despite the low quality publications? Or does my story sound like I simply have no talent for research and I should try something completely different, maybe to change a career...

I also have two associates degrees, one in General Studies and the other from the Community College of the Air Force in Munitions Systems Technology. However I only have a GPA of 2.77 for all my undergraduate coursework (I have earned 197 credits). I did complete 9 graduate credits at a different state university than my undergraduate where I earned two A- and one A, but then following semester I attempted 3 credits and earned an F because I had a bipolar depression episode and blew off the final paper. Bipolar disorder is why I have such a low GPA. For the last four years I have been well medicated and have been attending psychotherapy regularly and have not had any episodes (I used to have 5-6 a year while unmedicated). I last attended university in 2014. My question here is about how to create the most successful graduate school application. I am planning on taking 12 credits this spring at my undergraduate university. I could also take 12 credits in the summer too before the due date of my desired graduate school application (August 15). My goal for these two semesters would be to get at least a 3.6 GPA. However, currently I only need 34 credits to finish a BS in Political Science and 4 (maybe 8) credits to complete a Bachelors of Social Work.

Of course I can come up with other excuses such as working full time to fund my studies and covid. 

However, now I'm in a more stable situation and will have more time for the project. Lately I've been starting to have doubts mostly about my self but also the lab.

The people in the lab treat me like air.

We are in okay terms but I haven't made progress since I am stuck with something that is not a thing you can look up from the internet so I'm completely dependent on the tutor. How could I discuss this with the PI (without putting my tutor in a bad light)? Do you think the person could help but doesn't want to? I know it sounds silly and quite paranoid but I just have a feeling that everything is not how it should be.

Or is this all about me? The tutor sees that I have not been working 24/7 like all people in the lab seem to do. So this person thinks I'm not worth getting help?

clayhiiz,t2_4x2490h7,2019-10-31 20:42:52,dptmaf,1,"TL;DR: I am currently doing a self-funded PhD at a dream university of mine; 1 month in, I am already having big issues with my supervisor. I am starting to regret my decision.

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago, I applied to one of my dream universities for a PhD position, but I didn't expect to receive an offer... To my surprise, in February, I was told that I have been offered a place. For about three years prior to this - I didn't have much success with finding a PhD in the field that I wanted (computational chemistry).

Before I continue, I just want to mention a little bit about my background: I come from a single parent background and I didn't have the best academic start (I only achieved mainly Cs at GCSE due to not valuing education and also due to home issues). Things changed at sixth form; I received 2 A\*s, one A and 2 Bs in the three sciences, maths and further maths (had to self-teach further maths).  I managed to make it to one of the top universities in the UK; during my first year I was in the top 5-10% of my year with a high first mark (I also achieved top grade in the maths &amp; physics subsidiary exam in the year). But things started to get bad after first year with issues regarding depression. By second year, my grades slipped by 8% (scrapped a first) and by third year my grades slipped by another 10%. Thankfully, I managed to get CBT therapy (after being diagnosed with clinical depression) before my fourth year - and I ended up with a high 2.1 overall (a 1st for my research in 4th year) for my degree. But I felt like my grade, despite being good, didn't show my true potential.

After my undergraduate masters, I received a funded CDT (1+3) postgraduate position at the same university that I did my undergraduate. I mainly did it because I wanted to do a more mathematical degree because I wasn't satisfied with the level of maths in my previous degree (I regret not picking theoretical physics for undergrad). Things didn't turn out well due to issues regarding rent and me having issues with my supervisor; I only completed the first year. Basically, the course wasn't a good fit and the supervisor I had, during the final 3 months of the first year tipped ,things over the edge. I was 3% short from being able to continue onto PhD due to getting a poor grade during the research part of the course. 

After this incident, I decided to apply for PhD with no success - due to not knowing how to approach finding one. It wasn't until last year that I realised how to approach applying for a PhD - and I ended up with two offers and two top universities in the field I wanted. Unfortunately, my top choice university didn't have funding for me in the end; they notified me three months later. I was devastated. Soon afterwards, the other place I had an offer for also notified me that I wasn't chosen for a studentship (4 months after I was interviewed). My supervisor from the other university told me he has funding - but due to Brexit I would have to move to Spain eventually. This didn't sound too enticing to me, and I thought to myself (you know, I only have one life and a PhD was something I have wanted to do ever since I started to take my academics seriously). So I took the offer of doing a PhD self-funded at my dream university. I think losing my place at the CDT made me feel like a failure, academically, and i wanted to prove to myself that I was good enough - and what better place than at one of the most prestigious universities in the world doing a project that I am strongly passionate about.

I had a skype interview with my supervisor shortly after receiving the offer (I didn't get interviewed by him or even had direct conversation with him prior to this) and he said that he's happy to support me knowing that I'm self-funded; he said that so as long as I am doing the work, he'll support me as much as he can - he even said that if I need to work more remotely, that I can. He even said he would try to notify me of any TA jobs. This seemed very reassuring to me; I knew, due to my three years of experience of working a lot of jobs, that I could find a job on my own to support my studies - all I needed was a supportive supervisor. The Skype interview we had was so reassuring that I felt excited about the PhD - despite the self-funding element that came with it. But, I know more than anyone, that if I am motivated I am wiling to work tirelessly if it meant doing what I am  deeply passionate about.

But since starting this PhD things haven't been going well. I feel out of place in my group; my supervisor is NOT showing much support. My personality seems to clash with my supervisors. He never notifies us when he is free, he didn't even bother to read my analysis of a spectrum that I sent him via email. He constantly makes me feel like an idiot - despite me being the only person in the group that seems to be progressing the most with spectrum analysis. Also, he still hasn't even confirmed a project for me.

I'm already starting to feel depressed because I know the only way this PhD could work self-funded was with my supervisor showing me the support that he said he would show me when we had the first Skype interview. I feel like I made a massive mistake coming here. It is not the work I am struggling with, it's everything else. I've spoken to my university advisor about my issues with my supervisor and I have an appointment on Tuesday.",academia,Self-funded PhD

mlw19mlw91,t2_2hqedzqe,2019-08-29 17:42:11,cx47dl,10,"I was recently told that I would not be given accomodations on two grounds, my current good GPA of 3.8, and, what to them was a lack of ICD or DSM codes in the specific format they wanted.  I can correct this, in a few months time at the next PSYC appointment, but then I still have the issue of overcoming their objections due to my GPA.  

The GPA doesn't reflect a few facts:

* I benefited from academic renewal after four failures.  Counting these would result in a GPA of 2.77, and this is the GPA utilized by most other colleges for admission into their graduate programs.  The failed classes are still on my record, just not in my internal college GPA calculation
* I have had to withdraw from a semester due to mental health problems, but I withdrew before it was put onto my transcript
* the school's own counselor recommended I go inpatient, and said I should use ""medical withdrawl"" to do so.  
   * Medical withdrawl, IIRC, would prevent these things being on my transcript, but not in calculations for financial aid
* The added stress of explaining to instructors why I failed to get an assignment in on time, instructors either accepting it late or not, and then the huge added stress of compensating for these failures.  
* I was blessed with instructors last semester, who despite the fact that I didn't disclose my problems to them, never the less, I have reason to suspect they helped my grade.  One, I was one of the only students who participated in answering questions (sometimes interrupting before she was finished asking) and I was asked to allow other students to answer.  I then waited for those long pauses before answering.  The other I did the best they'd ever seen on an exit exam, probably thanks to ASD and some mania.  I finished in 10 minutes with 100% in comparison to other students who mostly got 70s, and took the full 50 minutes (this was a physics class)

&amp;#x200B;

My problems are numerous, and they focused on a narrow set of statistics which doesn't show the problems I face every day that are not encountered by my classmates who are gifted with better mental health than I am.  

Main diagnoses and related problems:

* ASD
   * anxiety
      * Giving presentations is very difficult, but tolerable
      * I have the general feeling of anxiety from the morning until I return home
   * social problems, poor grades in classes that require conversation in class
      * That english class where I did poorly because of this still bothers me
   * very shy at telling anybody when I need help, no friends in class to rely on for notes and help
   * This helped me in physics and math, courses I am no longer taking, but which contributed to my good GPA.  EX: last semester I did so good in physics ( [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/97d0/557e1f02f6e9b7f10a5d789c84cc653a8d8b.pdf](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/97d0/557e1f02f6e9b7f10a5d789c84cc653a8d8b.pdf) )
* Bipolar
   * Mania helped one semester ( the spring one)
   * depression did me in on two semesters (the last one being the summer semester)

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest fears probably cannot even be alleviated with any accommodations:

* withdrawl affecting student loans
   * repayment may become due the moment I am no longer enrolled half time, although I'm not sure
   * SAP may very well be affected
* academic difficulties affecting GPA for addmission into other programs not recognizing academic renewal 
   * there's probably no hope to fix the 2.77 GPA now

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions to you professors, and perhaps other students:

* would you disagree with someone who had these problems getting accomodations?  despite the high institutional GPA?  
* Should I not pursue this any further?  (my fear is when I need help, I will not have anything that says I can get it)
* Should I just get the documentation with the the codes to the accuracy they would like, and then, if they disagree again, note that the GPA doesn't take all the other things into account?",academia,"What is your honest opinion on accomodations for a student with mental health problems, but has a good GPA?"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing looking for some advice and opinions on my situation and course of action. I'll give a brief description of my  situation and my goals and hoping a kind soul could give me some constructive advice. :)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 26 years old, turning 27 in the next couple months. I currently have a 3 year BA degree in a humanities field. I was enrolled in a 4 year Honours degree program and failed to submit the thesis because of crippling depression at the time because of family issues. It just so conveniently happened during the most important time of my academic career. I honestly have no idea what was going on with my mental health at the time, I thought that I could snap out of it eventually but let it linger on for 5 years until I got help. 

During that time, everything regarding my thesis collapsed. I couldn't finish it and settled with a failed grade, repressed the grief and tried to find another career. I couldn't find a career that was right for me because my heart was still in academia. I've been in therapy for 1 year now and uncovering the grief of that failed thesis and trying to find out what to do next.

My career plan during my time in University was to have a career within higher education, specifically as an academic lecturer (which requires a PhD). My transcript was prepped to continue on to enrol in Masters program (3.6/4.0 GPA) after which I planned to do my PhD.

Now with a failed thesis that has the weight of 3 regular courses, a 3 year degree, and 3.0/4.0 overall GPA (2.3 program GPA), I basically have no chance for grad school in my country. 

I spoke to an academic advisor and was told that I could submit a petition for exemption to academic rules where I could explain my situation and request to have the thesis removed from my transcript. If that would go through then I could redo any thesis. However, I'm not sure about the likelihood my request would be accepted. I have a hunch that you need a good, documented reason to be granted an exemption. My mental illness at the time wasn't documented so the only thing I could do is explain my situation, provide my therapy receipts and perhaps a therapist's reference note.

In any case, if that doesn't go through the only thing I could do is redo my thesis with he failed credits, still earn my 4 year Honours degree and leave with a low GPA. I still wouldn't be eligible for a Masters degree program. To meet my career goals, I think I'd need to do another Bachelors degree.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone have any advice how I could meet my career goal? Is it realistic at this stage in my life? Do I have any options that you'd recommend? Let me know if you'd need any more info that I could provide. 

Thanks for your help. Be kind, it's been a rough week for thinking about this. :p Cheers!

I've been drinking due to depression so my apologies to everyone who has to read this.

Ever since I was a boy, history was the only thing that kept me going in life. When I was neglected, I had stories of Theodore Roosevelt and how he persevered to help me go through my childhood trauma. Whenever I was bullied through high school and was an outcast, I had my history books to give me comfort that everything will pass and if I worked hard everything will work out.

So I worked really hard to get into a good history program in order to open up the possibilities for me to get into academia. When I was in my undergrad, I worked twice as hard to the point I scarified my social life in order to grow my skills as a historian. My whole life had a main goal of being a historian because of how it got me through my terrible childhood. I had to contribute to the field in anyway I can because I wanted to contribute to it as it has contributed to me. If it wasn't for all of the stories that I read, then I don't know how I would have made it through the abuse that I sustained.

So I did everything in order to get into a PhD program. But, I found out history departments are shrinking across the country and that I would not get employed after I receive my PhD. This devastated me because being a historian was the only thing that I ever wanted. I did everything in my power to be a professor and now I have no real world experience to make it in the real world because I did everything in my college experience to work in history. So naturally, I work in a warehouse because I have no other skills.

The worst feeling of all is the emptiness I feel. Though I make decent money working at a warehouse, I don't have fulfillment because working in the field was my only desire. It's like I have no purpose now, none. I miss being in the library and looking at all of the books. I miss researching until I pass out. I miss being mentored by my professors. I worked so hard and I feel like my whole heart was ripped out from me. I love history so much, I don't know what to do and my only love is gone.

I don't expect anyone to read this and care, hell, I wouldn't care either. But I have to just get this off my chest somehow because I don't know how else too.

I’m working 4 jobs, 75 hours a week, 6 days a week. I’m not making enough money to survive. I can’t afford my car repairs. I can’t afford my home repairs. I can’t afford a necessary surgery or medical care. It’s very hard to help others if you are overworked and over-worried.

I have issues with social anxiety and depression. Not every day is my best day. When one of my students yells at me or makes fun of me, it is much harder for me to help the rest of you. I am trying to do better and let it roll off me, but your comments still hurt, and they run through my head when I’m sitting alone. I’m human, too.

I’m not actually trained as a teacher. I studied my subject. This included no courses in the theory of education or teaching methods. I’m winging it, every day. I am not provided with nor required to complete any continuing education. If I choose to attend a conference, that’s hundreds of dollars out of pocket (which I do not have), plus the lost hours from taking time off work. If I choose to take an online course, that is time and money I do not have.

My college offers no raises. I am making the same rate I made 7 years ago. If I go back and get a higher degree, I will get $2 more per hour. Since I’m currently working about 9 hours per week at the college, That means an extra $18/week or about $750/year. It would cost at least $40,000 to go back to school. The extra income would not even cover my student loans, and it would also not offer me the chance of additional raises in the future. For the record, my other 3 jobs are not teaching at the collegiate level, as there are very few job opportunities in my field.

I would love to meet with you after class to explain the material to you one-on-one. I would love to have office hours. My college does not give that to me. I am paid only for the time I am in the classroom. Every meeting I have with you comes out of my free time.

We are approaching the end of my third application call since I decided that I wanted to walk in academia, but apparently I am done already. I applied for something like 20 different positions in the last year. I was able to get 1 interview in that, that was unsuccessful.

I graduated in the top 10% in psychology, in a joint program between two European countries. This allowed me to be able to enroll in a Russell league uni in the UK without much effort for a MSc in a quantitative subject, but my last year's been hell on Earth.
Aside from my health problems (I suffer from a quite severe depression, that was worsened by relocation and this situation), speaking English as a second language, and some economic difficulties (I had funds for studying abroad, but clock's ticking), I didn't perform well in my course as I wanted to. 
I discovered to be skilled in quantitative data analysis and biostatistics, though. I know three programming languages quite fluently, I have loads of material in my folders demonstrating it. I worked as a volountary RA for two projects involving quantitative data analysis. I might have a publication out in the next year too.
I am currently following up some projects with my MSc supervisor, but it's all gratuitous work and this situation cannot last too long. Not that I am not motivated,but it takes time (that I need to work to live, y'know) and resources (that I don't have).

I am trying to apply to anything involving quantitative data analysis. My hope would be to be able to switch to biostatistics, with a PhD or some RA experience in this, but at this point I don't even know how to get there. I applied to loads of positions I thought they would be plan B or Cs, but I didn't even get an interview in those either. Despite not needing a visa, I cannot even get funding from the BRC/ESRC because I don't haven't lived here long enough.

Is there a trick for this? Is there something that I am completely missing? What I am supposed to do now?

I am having difficulty dealing with the loneliness.

Tl;dr: stress, level of expertise required and loneliness are common aspects of a career in academia. They also affect depression a lot. Is a career in academia possible with depression?",academia,Is a career in academia even possible with severe depression?

&amp;#x200B;

I am a PhD student at UW–Madison who has been suffering from the most severe depression, anxiety, and related imposter syndrome since starting graduate school. I moved across the country from California to work with my advisor here in Madison. I consider myself one of the luckiest people out there because of how supportive my advisor is and how generally cordial my colleagues are in addition to the fact that I am thriving academically, but I still cannot help but to struggle or to feel as if everything that I am accomplishing is for naught. I often liken my scenario to feeling as if I am treading water at times and going nowhere professionally, although I can notice my own progress and achievements in action. Nothing that I ever do is an end in itself. There is always something greater or better that I could be producing in the meantime.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is for those of us who have either left academia or have completed their PhDs and moved on, or those who feel as if they share my experiences. Do these feelings leave after one leaves the academic environment? Is this something that is specific to graduate school?   


I have taken the LSAT (scored decently) and will be applying to law school this application cycle, so my plan of leaving academia ABD is on the horizon, but I fear that these feelings will follow me afterward.",academia,Post-PhD Remission of Depression/Anxiety
hillywho,t2_3xmy59i4,2019-06-29 19:56:35,c73t1r,6,"Hello everyone,

I had a terrible year because of mental health and family problems and was hoping to get some feedback about my petition. I have crossed out any names for confidentiality.

To the petitions committee at the XXX. I am writing in the hope to lift my academic suspension of one year and be readmitted in the Fall Semester of 2019. I understand how unconventional this request is, however, there were extenuating circumstances that affected my academic and social well being. These were affected by ongoing mental health problems and internal conflicts within my family. To begin, I need to describe what the root cause of my downfall this year has been. I have been facing depression, anxiety as well as some sort of attention disorder problems since late winter 2018. The cause of my current mental state is my mother (who I was previously living with), suffers from a very severe form of paranoid schizophrenia. My dad, who left me and my mom right after I graduated high school, suggested I move out because of my mom's delusions, irrational suspicions as well as complete dominance and control over my daily life. For example, in the fall of 2018, I took a course called MAT 246 which took place from 6PM to 9PM. Even though she knew my timetable, my mother wanted me to come home by 7:30 each day from XXX. She continuously insisted that I come home early because she had a suspicion that instead of attending lectures, I am having a personal relationship with another woman and my life is at risk. I just wanted to focus on my academic life however, everyday felt like an unwinnable battle. From complaints about people following her around the city, to horrendous claims that the government is trying to poison her, I just had to give in. There even came a point where she felt the microphones on my phone and laptop were being tapped, so as soon as I arrived home she used to confiscate my laptop and my phone because she felt, ""the people"" were listening through the microphones on my laptop. I went to seek help from my family doctor multiple times; however, the XXX Ministry of health cannot intervene unless patient is willing to accept the fact that he/she has a mental health problem. Frustrated, I started to bury all my feelings deep inside, embarrassed to share them with others. I didn't want to get my friends involved in my personal matters because I was afraid of what my mom would say to them. I thought moving to the downtown campus would help for a change, but it only made matters worse because of the longer commute and strict curfews that were imposed at home. I started becoming afraid of making mistakes on my evaluations for Math &amp; CS even though I knew that my answers were correct, I used to stay motionless for hours before an evaluation, completely stressed out even though I had practiced weeks in advance and knew the content. In late November, I started suffering from severe insomnia because of the lingering thoughts of getting questions wrong on a test. I realised I wasn’t going to make it through the two semesters at this rate, so I asked some of the professors at the downtown campus for help regarding course selection. One of the professors, XXX suggested I look at a few Philosophy courses that require less computation and more analysis. I decided to audit XXX (taught by XXX) which was like XXX a proofs course I took during my first year at XXX. Along with it, I took a course called XXX which focused purely on the analysis of statistics with very minimal computation. Even though my final mark in the course wasn’t great, I have realized that path focused more towards analysis rather than computation is better suited for me. Currently, I am auditing 2 courses during the summer at the downtown campus (because my internship is close by) which include XXX and XXX, courses focused on analysis. I want to switch my major to something in philosophy or cognitive science because I am traumatized by CS, Math &amp; Stats. I regret not getting help earlier during the school year however I was in denial the whole time, trying to fix the problems all by myself. I tried to reach out to CAMH multiple times however, the sheer ignorance and lack of understanding about mental health and the stigma revolving around it bested me. Plus, I tried going there in February &amp; March a couple of times, however I came back dissuaded because of the long wait times at the emergency services. Currently, I am undergoing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in order to get ready for the school year. Also, through CAMH I was able to connect with the university’s Student Progress &amp; Support services, where I sought help for managing the complexities of my circumstances. I have been in contact with XXX at the XXX Student Services Center, receiving help with my petition and my academic as well as social well being. I have always strived hard to do well in school, however because of these extenuating circumstances last year, it has been quite difficult to succeed. I hope the petitions committee can allow me to return to school in fall, as I am showing signs of recovery through Behavioural Therapy sessions. Currently, I am working during the summer and have enough money saved up to cover my living expenses as well as tuition for the next calendar year. Also, I am living a few blocks away from XXX campus which means I won’t have to commute either. I should have made better choices in the 2018-2019 school year; however, I wasn’t in the right state of mind and so I hope the university can give me this chance to prove myself. I thank you for reviewing my request and I fully support the committee's final decision in the matter.",academia,Academic Suspension Petition Help
Diego_Velathqueth,t2_2icxfraz,2019-06-24 08:32:42,c4k8ih,1,"Hi all!

I am a recent graduate with a B. S. in psychology. I literally had my ceremony last weekend and now that all the graduation magic has died down I am still unemployed and confused about my career.

I am considering giving it my all, saving up for grad school, and then pursue that doctorate in Psychology I’ve been longing for since undergrad. 

I just don’t know if it’s the right path for me. Ever since I was a child, I have had a myriad of “dream jobs” and “career goals” that I just could not stick with. During my time in undergraduate school, I fell in love with the environment. I loved the campus. I loved the feeling of knowing you are surrounded by people striving towards the same goal. And the respect I had for my professors! 

I am just weary about this longing of mine to commit to graduate school. I had straight A’s up until my senior year—I had/been having a terrible bout of depression and just a lot of existential crises—and I’m just trying to recover from that. I’m also kind of weary as the last year or two of college I began to develop a more reclusive state as my depression set in. Losing my presidential position at an Honors fraternity, quitting my research position, and the decline of my connections to graduate students and professors. Basically I graduated in a really bad state. 

Now I feel the void that is no longer having my name actively enrolled in a large institution. I miss research and I miss not only learning, but actively thinking and understanding concepts and information not many care to appreciate. 

The way faculty worked and lived at my school was very interesting; it seemed like professors devoted most of their lives to their discipline. They definitely take work home. And I think I like that! But I don’t know if that is right for me. And it makes it all the harder a choice now that I’ve moved back home and am away from campus.",academia,Is the world of Academia right for me?

Long story short, I have an awful chair who thinks it should take all of his students 7 years to graduate. My committee is also very hands off. After busting my butt for years, my chair won't even give me a job recommendation. I have published over 10 papers (5 first author) and present at national conferences. Its not for lack ot trying. 

I am going into my 4th year in the program. I have passed my dissertation proposal and was in the middle of collecting data when this pandemic hit. Needless to say I probably won't make my goal of graduating in August because this pandemic impacts my study population. I can't collect all my data online. But I could collect it from where I am once the virus concerns let up. 

Because of my chair and my generally poor situation, I have fought like hell to still get first author papers and network. I was offered a position as a researcher and then I would transition to a post doc once my PhD is conferred. 

I basically am struggling with the decision. If I decide to move, I will have to collect my data remotely and doing so with my chair and distant committee will be difficult. However the benefit is that I would essentially be working my dream job. Its perfectly aligned with my niche research and there aren't many opportunities for me if I stay where I am. My area is pretty niche. This would give me connections and opportunities I can't find anywhere else. There is more potential for me at the new agency. 

However. I would have to leave my boyfriend and his daughter behind because they can't move with me. I also have to leave my mom who has been struggling with health issues and my dog. I have been struggling with depression so I don't know how this will play out with me being alone in a new state across the country. 

I need to make a decision ASAP so I can sign the lease and move or else I lose out on the apartment I found. 

What would you do? Is it worth it to try to finish remotely? I will have the resources to do so...its just a matter of leaving what's comfortable for the unknown. On paper it is a no brainer. This will be incredible experience. In reality I'm scared to go.",academia,Weighing the academic experience versus my personal situation...how do you make the right decision?

PaulChomedey,t2_10k33t,2018-12-22 01:26:21,a8gjcj,1,"I'm currently working on my master's thesis (~100 pages) in literature &amp; philosophy and I struggle so much with the writing process. I miss the good old days of undergrad where I could write 50 pages in a week for various essays, because I was dealing with much less information and was putting much less pressure on my shoulders. Nowadays, I have **so many mental blockages** about writing that it's nearly impossible for me to write anything new. I can't write at home anymore, whereas I would work on my messy desk for hours on end in undergrad. I can't write if I'm ""not feeling it"". I can't write if I don't have a whole day (or at least more than 3 hours) in front of me. I can't bring myself to finish anything because of the fear of ""being dumb"", or because I have so many information to deal with that it's hard to figure out any ""natural"" order my discourse should adopt, or because there's always another aticle that I could include in citations. Ever since I've been in grad school, the writing process has been incredibly tedious, proportionally to how the research is just so much fun. I see people left and right pumping articles like it's cupcakes, while I can spend **whole days** on a single paragraph.

throwa2934,t2_xrnuh,2018-12-13 22:54:23,a5ypgh,1,"**TL;DR:** A year after graduating college, I got legal justice against students and a Dean who bullied me.

I'm an Indian American Muslim male. During my junior year of college, I was suffering from depression and anxiety, and I was also a physics-philosophy double-major with a pre-med track. I became interested in the purpose of a college education and doing research on the history/philosophy of education to find answers to questions I pondered such as: What is the purpose of volunteering/grades/extracurriculars/etc? Why do we learn the way we do? How do we use these classes to help us realize those things? I spoke w/philosophers, scientists, professors, and other professionals to gather information about these issues from them, too.

I tried starting a conversation among a premed club I was part of, but they retaliated against me. They isolated me, manipulated me, made lies about me, and reported me to the Dean that I was harassing them. They mostly did this out of their insecurities for those questions I was suggesting, but it was also because I was presenting well-researched, justified beliefs that contradicted theirs.

The Dean proceeded to criticize, interrupt, mock, and interrogate me with force. She said I was acting ""bizarre"" and called my story ""twisted."" She didn't give me a chance to defend myself. She'd laugh at me when I tried explaining how my friends were making up lies about me to silence me. She interrupted me in ways that I couldn't even finish what I was saying. I was traumatized. The University charged me with harassment and stalking. They left me off with a warning, but they made sure I'd start therapy (with a social worker who had no graduate training) so I could better myself. I had no choice but to blame myself for everything and agree with whatever the Dean told me.

That's when things got worse. I felt the pain, fear, anxiety, and distrust spreading into other parts of my life. Even when I tried doing positive things (like exercising and meditating) I felt the mocking voice of the Dean resonating in my head. I began sleeping 10-12 hrs/day, stopped praying and exercising, eating less healthy, going to class less, and lost sight in the purpose of my classes. It got to the point where I wasn't doing any studying and felt my blood boiling in my lectures. I had no idea what I was suffering from.

I couldn't do anything to defend myself because I feared repercussions and abuse from the Dean of Students. My friends didn't know how to help me so they isolated themselves from me. My professors watched as my grades dropped and I could barely will myself out of bed for the last two years of college. Not having answers to my questions of the purpose of a college education started taking its toll on me. And the toxicity of the environment around me towards me just made me scared of myself. I stopped being premed because I didn't see any value in the field if this was how things worked. I even couldn't finish my philosophy degree because, during senior year, I'd have flashbacks to the Dean every time I tried writing philosophy. I would break down in tears and fits of rage in which I couldn't do anything every time I tried writing.

My therapist (in hindsight) sucked. He just talked about superficial things (like social skills), didn't take notes, gave me a blank stare most of the time, and just tried to keep me out of trouble (instead of understanding me). He'd just say things like ""Oh, people are idiots."" He even believed in astrology. I never realized how terrible he was until now.

It's now been over a year since I graduated. I've spent the past year taking weekly therapy sessions (with a therapist with a PhD and decades of experience) out of my own will. This therapist is amazing (like a modern day Sigmund Freud) in how he gives detailed answers, speaks truthfully and with justification, and has amazing skills in rhetoric. I've spent the past 2 months emailing various university administrators and officials about my story. I went into great detail about how it affected me and mentioned (by name) the students and staff involved. 2 weeks ago I got off the phone with a senior investigator from the university. She said what I went through was egregiously wrong and should have never happened to anyone. She said they're going to require racial/religious bias training from the Dean and other staff members that were involved. And, best of all, the university now knows the individuals who did this to me and they said they'd take action against them. I told the investigator I didn't want anymore input.

sigh of relief

It took 3 years. But I finally got my voice heard and taken seriously from the university. I want to take a sigh of relief and say I'm fine now, but it's still going to take me a while to figure myself out. It's gonna take some visits to coffee shops and long walks.

But I've been eating well, exercising most days, studying philosophy and physics to my heart's content, and planning on going back to grad school soon.

I won. sigh... Let this be a victory for everything a university should stand for. Let the future be brighter for students who wish to learn and grow. The past is heavy, but the future is greater. And I will no longer be shackled by fear.

I want to extend my gratitude to everyone who supported me along the way. I want to thank my current therapist most of all. And thank you for reading this. It really means a lot to me.",academia,"After 3 years, I won"

immindaweird,t2_18zc6zp,2017-06-07 00:49:06,6fq2vj,5,"My friends and family are a bit skeptical that I have depression. Rather, they are not entirely convinced that my issues were the cause of my drop in grades. Instead, they think I'm either not as smart as I think I am and/or slacked off. I want to argue that my sharp drop in grades/motivation is due to depression/sleep disorder that is the result of repressed issues that I did not address until recent therapy.

I would like an objective third party to weigh both sides of the story and offer their opinion. I chose r/academia because this situation occurs in primarily an academic context, and you all are likely a more objective than r/snek. If you have any recommendations for better subs, please let me know.

Also, I'm really not sure whether I can trust my own opinion. 

What follows is likely lots of overthinking/blowing things out of proportion. I'm aware of that. *I am asking for an objective judgement of my situation, as I don't want to lie to myself, and I can't trust my own opinion.*

**Facts:** 
- I got into a very selective college program. 
- Freshman year went well. First semester sophomore year I tanked in grades. Had another dip junior year. Did well first semester senior year with disability accomodations. 
- I was known for smoking a lot of weed during senior year of high school, freshman year, and sophomore year. 
- Most students at my uni, even in my program, find that freshman year is significantly easier than any of the other years.  
- I found a disorder online called Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder, and got a doctor to sign off on it. Friends/family still don't believe me
- I got a medical withdrawal for the problem semester, but family and friends think I'm just lying to myself/full of shit.
- If you want more info, please comment.

**Their argument:** Most people around me agree that my sub-par performance is simply due to my lack of ability and work ethic. 
- I smoked a lot of weed and did not attend class.
- I began to put down my institution, and stopped caring. People seemed to think that I became the guy who was ""smart, but didn't try."" (or rather saw myself as such)
- I wasn't the smartest guy on earth. Sure, I wasn't stupid, but the other kids in my program weren't intimidated by me. Brought up in an uber-competitive asian household, my parents never seemed to think I was the next Einstein. 
- Sophomore year classes were significantly more difficult, and many others experience difficulty their first semester of sophomore year.
- During sophomore year, I decided to change careers/majors. Didn't sit well with mom and dad. Pair this with pot and bad grades, I look like I'm a slacker. 
- I did lots of ill-advised shit. Particularly, I tried to start a BS student organization that never really panned out. For someone who thought of himself as a genius, I started an organization with no mission and annoyed lots of other student org leaders to get their members. All I did was further isolate myself. 

**My argument:**
- I'm normally highly motivated. I may not have been #1, but I am very ambitious. I wrote a detailed plan the summer before my freshman year for getting into an Ivy League grad school. I loved working hard - I am not ""innately smart"", I had to work for all my previous success.
- I had/have lots of trouble sleeping, especially during that semester. Moreso than normal college students. Like 2 hrs/night for 1-2 weeks. I saw a doctor, but she seemed very skeptical of my issues. She offered Ambien, but I didn't want a dependency. She instead gave me Trazadone, which I barely took. I didn't return for a followup.
- Sleeping issues persisted until I tried Ambien and ""bright light therapy"" (shining a 10k lux light at my face in the morning)
-  My weed-smoking was never an issue until then. I was always goal oriented; I prided myself in prioritizing. Like every other smart kid in my grade, I partied when I could and studied when I needed to. It wasn't until sophomore year that I did nothing but stay holed up in my room smoking.
- I had bouts of depression before sophomore year. There was a similar period in high school when I just ""let go"". I was bullied (alottt) and moved in between my 2nd and 3rd year of high school, and I never really acknowledged whatever negative feelings I had. Even during freshman year of college, I would feel very empty and shitty at points.
- I saw a therapist senior year and realized that my aversion to career that I was previously very motivated about was likely related to issues with how I viewed my own race. Once I realized this, I got over whatever ambivalence I was experiencing regarding my career. 
- The student organization was a half-assed attempt at validation. If I wasn't in a really shitty mood and had all of my confidence, I would not have started it. It was the first time my insecurities motivated me to do something. It took me a year to swallow my pride and call it off and start over with a real organization.
 
*Here is my version of events*: Had trouble sleeping due to repressed issues/depression. Lack of sleep affected my mood and motivation, and I stayed reclused in my apt and turned to weed. (not the other way around...) From there, my shot confidence and self-esteem turned me into a quiet, weird guy that made lots of off-putting comments.

**Remarks:** My family doesn't completely buy that bottling up years of bullying and racial insecurity led to me breaking down and finding refuge in weed. While they are very surprised and concerned (I never told anyone about this beforehand), they don't understand why the bullying affected me one particular year far after the the actual stuff happened. I am a ditzy and sometimes incompetent guy, and I was in a very difficult curriculum. Not enough hard evidence for my case. 

My friends just think I'm a know-it-all stoner that failed a semester and then got really whiny about it and fell back on a bullshit ""Sleep Disorder"". They think my depressive state is the result of my bad grades, not past unresolved issues (to be fair I am disheartened because I did not perform well).

My credibility is shot among (some) professors, and most friends and family. I'm still the fuckoff that never went to class and never tried. I have one more academic year to kill it and wins some competitions and prove myself, but until then (the end of my college career), I'm still a has-been. I could get new friends, but these are the folks that I would normally be best friends with, but I had such a fog over my head (before medication) and acted badly. My reputation is sealed and I am stressed out. People don't trust me with anything anymore. I would appreciate advice to address my credibility, but I understand that r/academia is not the place for such advice.

academiamakesmevomit,,2017-09-27 00:44:24,72oslb,2,"I really wish someone told me this before I became an academic, but now my life feels stuck and I don't know what to do.

* I hate academics. So many of them are full of themselves, they take petty shots at each other in an attempt to make themselves look good, and they are fucking hypocritical. So much of your career in academia is made via politics, yet people outwardly take this lofty attitude towards politics. I'd much rather see the academics owning up to the fact that most of them wouldn't be where they are without politics (advisor calling buddies up, schmoozing with the powerful people at conferences, I've seen many of my colleagues going as far as checking reference letters for their students/postdocs to ensure that they're fine). I'm admittedly bitter because my advisor was one of the few people who didn't do this; I ended up at a decent R1 tenure-track but it killed me to see everyone pull up ahead of me because of politics.

* On the note of politics, I actually unfollowed most of my colleagues (so you're still ""friends"" but you never see them on facebook) because they're so politically active, and they always talk about how they brought up the latest political issue into the classroom. I'm as passionate about politics as anyone else, but for god's sake, don't abuse your position and bring politics into the classroom. I'd give even Donald Trump an A+ if he aced all my tests. Not sure if I can say the same about some of my colleagues.

* I hate the compensation. I put in 20+ years of hard work in school and I get paid not even $100k. My friends who left academia are probably pulling in $300K+ at this point. I'd leave, but it turns out that the industry is not so into hiring people who've stuck around in academia after grad school, because these are the people who want to be in academia but couldn't stay (they'd much rather take the fresh PhDs because it somehow shows that they wanted to be in the industry and not academia).

* Research isn't going well. I don't know what it is, but I just can't seem to focus or care about the projects that I'm working on. Maybe my heart is no longer there. On that note, I hate bringing work home in the evenings. I used to love it. Having this memory makes my change of heart even more painful, because I know that my attitude isn't right. It used to be better.

* It's mentally taxing. So many people around me are depressed, so I've actually started isolating myself from all the negative influence. I know I'm supposed to be there to be supportive and shit for the depressed people, but honestly, I'm in no position to be caring for the others because I'm also recovering from a depression that lasted many years. I'm afraid that they're going to drag me back into the soul-crushing abyss.

* I hate where I live. Sure, R1 is great and prestigious, but oh man, I thought I'd be a uber successful happy rich person living in some beautiful penthouse in a sophisticated city. Reality fucking sucks, I'm in a place that is barely a city, I hate it and there's nothing to do.

* I hate teaching. The students are a lot weaker than anyone I'm really used to. They whine and they get upset if you give them the grades that they actually deserve. I never had much patience for people who lack discipline.

The sad thing is, I don't think I have better options than this. The job security is great, the flexibility is great, and honestly, at this age, I don't think I have a great shot at the top companies in the industry. Short of going back to med school or law school, I don't think my life would improve by leaving academia, and it kills me to realize that I've achieved my maximum potential and that I'm not happy.",academia,[rant] I hate being an academic.
BrechtB,t2_y6ymh,2016-05-25 04:34:00,4kxyrw,4,"Hi r/academia! 

I hope this is an appropriate topic for this sub, I wasn't really sure where else to pose this question. 

As the title says, I did rather poorly as an undergraduate student due to undiagnosed Bipolar II disorder. I graduated two years ago, and was diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder shortly after graduation. 

My major was French, and since high school I have been enthralled with learning the language. I spent a gap year interning/studying in France between high school and college thanks to a generous fellowship, but resolved not to major in French as it was a useless degree according to my parents. 

Once I got to university (a top 50 university FWIW), I took a few French classes to satisfy Gen Ed requirements and couldn't stay away. I LOVED all my French courses, and finished with a 3.8 Major GPA. 

However, in spells of depression, I regularly skipped classes and did rather poorly in other classes because I simply could not get out of bed. When I was manic, I was sometimes inappropriate in class (arrogant towards my classmates, oversharing - just generally embarrassing things). On both end of the spectrums, my behavior was cringeworthy and while I had very nice French professors who I was able to build relationships with due to the small department size, I wouldn't feel comfortable asking them for recommendation letters at this point due to my both my behavior and my frequent absences. 

A few months ago, I came across a PhD program offered by a highly-ranked university near where my parents live. I quickly pushed the idea out of my mind due to my lackluster undergrad record and issues of practicality, as I have a great job in Marketing with an international company. However, I can't stop thinking about this program and how happy continuing my French studies would make me. Before Bipolar derailed my life, I had always dreamed of a career as a French professor.

I have been in counseling since my diagnosis and am now on medication. My behavior has an undergone a complete 180, and I am determined to stay stable. Still, I'm confident that no PhD program would accept me after looking at my transcripts and I don't feel comfortable asking professors for recommendations as I could rarely rouse myself from bed during my final semester. 

Given my situation, would any PhD program even consider me? I don't know if I should contact my professors to express my remorse for my past behavior, explain my diagnosis (which nobody outside my family knows) and ask if they would offer a recommendation? I'm sure they knew something was wrong but this route seems both awkward and potentially humiliating. Should I explain my situation when applying to the program? Should I enroll in classes as a non-degree seeking student at another institution to show that I can do well in postgraduate courses and build rapport with these professors? Could I apply for the program this year and then try again? 

TL;DR: I was very passionate about French as an undergrad, but my undergraduate experience was derailed by undiagnosed Bipolar disorder. This included earning C's and D's in several classes, not going to class, and graduating with a 2.95 GPA. My (French) major GPA was a 3.8. After graduation, I was diagnosed. I'm now stable thanks to medication and counseling, and am determined to stay that way. Would I have any shot of any PhD program given my circumstances?

drblorpenstein,t2_y6049,2016-05-24 05:56:09,4kse4g,7,"Hi, there's a lot to say about this but I'll try to keep it as brief as possible so as not to bore you or lose your attention.

I'm in my 5th year of a PhD program. Shortly after I joined the group, another guy, let's call him Dave, joined too. My advisor had kind of hyped him up to us in the time preceding him arriving, and for good reason: he's very good and accomplished in the area he knows, so on paper he was an excellent catch for the group.

After being there for a bit, I learned (from him, he's fairly open about it) that he suffers from several diagnosed mental health problems, like bipolar disorder, sleep troubles, and depression. Those have been diagnosed and he has medication for them. The problem is that he heavily abuses prescription drugs (that he has prescriptions for). 

Very early on, when I only knew him a little, I got pretty scared when he kind of disappeared and didn't respond to texts or anything for 3 or 4 days. I was debating calling someone but decided not to. After a couple days, he showed back up, as if basically everything was normal. 

I soon found out that this was a pattern for him: he'd basically binge on Adderall when he got a new prescription at the beginning of the month, stay up for ungodly amounts of time, and then to avoid the crazy/delirium from staying up, he'd take a lot of Ambien/Klonopin, and pass out for absurd amounts of time. I've done my share of this stuff, and he takes pretty heroic/stupid amounts.

So this shocked me at first, but I realized that he *kind* of had it under control, or at least knew what he was doing. Obviously, doing this amount and combination of drugs isn't ""control"", but it didn't seem like he was going to OD or something.

What's changed recently is that, he used to actually get a lot of work done when he was on an Adderall binge. He'd basically be working for like 5 days straight, and he's very smart, so he'd end up averaging out (counting the time after that he spends sleeping for several days straight) to about the same amount of work as a normal person gets done. But in the past few months, it's seemed like he's barely working at all. When he binges, he ends up doing stupid shit like organizing things that don't need to be organized for hours, optimizing it. I'll also not really see him for a while, and then he'll come into our office on a Friday evening, getting ready to go out to some bars/clubs. He'll get pretty wrecked over the course of the weekend and then not come in for most of the week, and then pretty much do the same thing weekly.

To be clear, I'm not actually concerned about his work productivity; I'm concerned about what it implies. If he doesn't care about what he's doing here, and he has spent ~5 years floundering, I wonder if something has changed and he may start making worse and more harmful choices.

Most recently, he got some coke, and has been doing that in the office. I'm totally fine with coke being used recreationally in general, but in his case I think it's worrying when he's made the transition from (albeit stupid amounts) of drugs he legally has prescribed, to street drugs, because that means pretty much anything is on the table.

He went away to rehab maybe 6 months ago. He came back and seemed fairly serious about not fucking around too much anymore, but it didn't last long. I think he's gone before a few times too.

Our advisor knows that he has the *health problems* he does, but he doesn't really know about the drug habits; he ascribes Dave's strange behaviors to the health problems. He has heard rumors though. Things get around, some grad students are closer with their advisors, they see stuff, they mention it, etc. He's been what I would call infinitely patient, considering he's been supporting a guy for 5 years who has yet to show a single publication while here.

The other person who knows the full extent of Dave's problems is a postdoc we both know well. He seems generally worried, but I guess not worried enough to pursue anything (if there is anything to do). We've talked about it but haven't really concluded anything beyond that it's tricky.

Dave has a girlfriend who lives a few states away who seems generally concerned about him. For example, a few weeks ago she called the postdoc in a panic and had him try to get in contact with Dave, because she was very worried about him. When he went to Dave's apartment, there was also a policeman whom she had called. He was actually just sleeping, but my point is just that her reaction says something. I have no idea how much she knows, but I imagine everything, since they've been together for a while.

I've talked to him a few times, just telling him to take it easy, maybe not do the craziness he does, but when it comes down to it, he seems (and he's pretty much said as much) that he's really, really depressed. The drugs offer him a distraction/relief from that, which is why he does what he does.

Part of me thinks that there's not much I can do. What do you think? Is there something I should do? Or is it better to stay out of it?",academia,"I'm kind of worried about my coworker's drug use, but I'm not sure what I can do that would be actually effective...any ideas?"
GarnByte,t2_xfbtl,2016-11-14 19:42:41,5cxww7,2,"Hey there. 

I've been struggling with depression this semester and I've reached this point in my academic life with at least one of my classes. It's very likely that I can't bring my grade up to pass the class. Which is worse? I would assume neither is better than the other. But looking for opinions. 

I'm a senior undergard and have been an honors student at a STEM school, but this past year has been mentally rough and has significantly impacted my grades. I fear the last two semesters of my college career will significantly hinder my chance of a job / eventually grad school (at least a masters), despite getting good grades the other three years and having plenty of experience. Any thoughts about this would also help.

LumpyCatSweater,t2_ycx1a,2016-10-30 01:04:45,5a3pwa,7,"I started my MS degree a year ago, and it didn't take me long to realize something was up with my advisor.  They seemed forgetful (forgetting about meetings, due dates, etc) and somewhat emotionally unstable (crying in class, getting extremely angry if I asked them a question about what they wanted me to do) and confusing (long rambling descriptions of experiments that made no sense). I met a grad student coordinator, and they acknowledged my advisor had the signs of early-onset dementia, though obviously nothing could be done because, well, academia.  I didn't quit the program because I was fully funded, I work in a small field with few available positions for grad students, and because I had already completed a first semester and been accepted to an overseas fellowship program I really wanted to join. I decided things weren't bad enough to quit despite the stress and depression I was experiencing, and that I could probably finish despite my advisor's apparent problems.

After I came back from the fellowship, I could tell my advisor was doing worse. They seemed more erratic and forgetful than before, and now I am worried about what to do. During the summer, they had removed some of my tissue cultures from the lab, and sent them to another facility against my wishes. They were contaminated (as I knew they would be) and my advisor brought them back when I returned. Contamination quickly spread to the other cultures in the lab, and when my advisor noticed they blamed me for it, telling me I was on the verge of ruining a very expensive project. I told my advisor that I thought the contamination came from the cultures brought from the other facility, and asked them if they weren't the one who brought the samples back...they were unable to process this information and just stared blankly at me. The same statement was made to my advisor at least two other times, and again, they got quiet and didn't respond, seemingly unable to remember bringing anything back.

Later, everyone in the lab sat down together and created an anti-contamination protocol for the lab to highlight sources of contamination and mitigation methods. During this session, my advisor acknowledged the other facility was a source of contamination. A few minutes later, when discussing another experiment, they told me to send my clean material to the contaminated facility because there were available growth chambers there...this is the same material that they were panicking over just days before. In the span of a few minutes they seemed to forget that they had just said this outside facility was contaminated and we shouldn't send anything there.

Since then I have found dirty, contaminated culture flasks sitting open on the counter, left by my advisor, and other things amiss such as the lid of an acid bottle being left off, samples that I had in the freezer being thrown away despite having huge ""DO NOT THROW OUT"" labels on them, etc. My advisor is also trying to get me to write a paper...something I'm against since the parts they want me to include are from different, unrelated experiments. Basically, the paper would be a long rambling, confusing piece of garbage.

What can I do to protect myself and make it to graduation? I can't go to the department because they would either propose sitting down and discussing this with my advisor (something I would get punished for later) or they would just say nothing could be done. I don't want to write and publish garbage papers, but my advisor is extremely controlling, manipulative, and downright abusive at times, so it is very hard to get around them...and I still need a letter of recommendation when all is said and done. I am only 8 months away from graduation, and I want to leave with my CV and wits intact. So, what can I do?",academia,Advisor has dementia...what should I do?

Doing my PhD. I am scared, to inaction at times, by the word counts I have to meet. No matter what piece of work it is, how small, I put it off and off, worried it will be shit, worried that I won't make the word count (when actually I always have to cut down the words).

The (peer-reviewed article) seems to imply that North Korean defectors with experience of repatriation and/or family members in North Korea have a higher perceived stigma for depression (14). 

However, at the same time it implies this is the case for defectors with North Korean family in South Korea (12). This is also what the data in their table 3 backs up and is included in the summary. 

I see no data or argument to support the first case.
